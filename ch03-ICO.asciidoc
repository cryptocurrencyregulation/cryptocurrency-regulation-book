Thank you Andy. I am pleased to be here today. This event provides a great opportunity to address a topic that is the subject of considerable debate in the press and in the crypto-community -- whether a digital asset offered as a security can, over time, become something other than a security.

To start, we should frame the question differently and focus not on the digital asset itself, but on the circumstances surrounding the digital asset and the manner in which it is sold. To that end, a better line of inquiry is: “Can a digital asset that was originally offered in a securities offering ever be later sold in a manner that does not constitute an offering of a security?” In cases where the digital asset represents a set of rights that gives the holder a financial interest in an enterprise, the answer is likely “no.” In these cases, calling the transaction an initial coin offering, or “ICO,” or a sale of a “token,” will not take it out of the purview of the U.S. securities laws.

But what about cases where there is no longer any central enterprise being invested in or where the digital asset is sold only to be used to purchase a good or service available through the network on which it was created? I believe in these cases the answer is a qualified “yes.” I would like to share my thinking with you today about the circumstances under which that could occur.

Before I turn to the securities law analysis, let me share what I believe may be most exciting about distributed ledger technology -- that is, the potential to share information, transfer value, and record transactions in a decentralized digital environment. Potential applications include supply chain management, intellectual property rights licensing, stock ownership transfers and countless others. There is real value in creating applications that can be accessed and executed electronically with a public, immutable record and without the need for a trusted third party to verify transactions. Some people believe that this technology will transform e-commerce as we know it. There is excitement and a great deal of speculative interest around this new technology. Unfortunately, there also are cases of fraud. In many regards, it is still “early days.”

But I am not here to discuss the promise of technology -- there are many in attendance and speaking here today that can do a much better job of that. I would like to focus on the application of the federal securities laws to digital asset transactions -- that is how tokens and coins are being issued, distributed and sold. While perhaps a bit dryer than the promise of the blockchain, this topic is critical to the broader acceptance and use of these novel instruments.

I will begin by describing what I often see. Promoters, in order to raise money to develop networks on which digital assets will operate, often sell the tokens or coins rather than sell shares, issue notes or obtain bank financing. But, in many cases, the economic substance is the same as a conventional securities offering. Funds are raised with the expectation that the promoters will build their system and investors can earn a return on the instrument -- usually by selling their tokens in the secondary market once the promoters create something of value with the proceeds and the value of the digital enterprise increases.

When we see that kind of economic transaction, it is easy to apply the Supreme Court's “investment contract” test first announced in SEC v. Howey. That test requires an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others. And it is important to reflect on the facts of Howey. A hotel operator sold interests in a citrus grove to its guests and claimed it was selling real estate, not securities. While the transaction was recorded as a real estate sale, it also included a service contract to cultivate and harvest the oranges. The purchasers could have arranged to service the grove themselves but, in fact, most were passive, relying on the efforts of Howey-in-the-Hills Service, Inc. for a return. In articulating the test for an investment contract, the Supreme Court stressed: “Form [is] disregarded for substance and the emphasis [is] placed upon economic reality.” So the purported real estate purchase was found to be an investment contract -- an investment in orange groves was in these circumstances an investment in a security.

Just as in the Howey case, tokens and coins are often touted as assets that have a use in their own right, coupled with a promise that the assets will be cultivated in a way that will cause them to grow in value, to be sold later at a profit. And, as in Howey -- where interests in the groves were sold to hotel guests, not farmers -- tokens and coins typically are sold to a wide audience rather than to persons who are likely to use them on the network.

In the ICOs I have seen, overwhelmingly, promoters tout their ability to create an innovative application of blockchain technology. Like in Howey, the investors are passive. Marketing efforts are rarely narrowly targeted to token users. And typically at the outset, the business model and very viability of the application is still uncertain. The purchaser usually has no choice but to rely on the efforts of the promoter to build the network and make the enterprise a success. At that stage, the purchase of a token looks a lot like a bet on the success of the enterprise and not the purchase of something used to exchange for goods or services on the network.

As an aside, you might ask, given that these token sales often look like securities offerings, why are the promoters choosing to package the investment as a coin or token offering? This is an especially good question if the network on which the token or coin will function is not yet operational. I think there can be a number of reasons. For a while, some believed such labeling might, by itself, remove the transaction from the securities laws. I think people now realize labeling an investment opportunity as a coin or token does not achieve that result. Second, this labeling might have been used to bring some marketing “sizzle” to the enterprise. That might still work to some extent, but the track record of ICOs is still being sorted out and some of that sizzle may now be more of a potential warning flare for investors.

Some may be attracted to a blockchain-mediated crowdfunding process. Digital assets can represent an efficient way to reach a global audience where initial purchasers have a stake in the success of the network and become part of a network where their participation adds value beyond their investment contributions. The digital assets are then exchanged -- for some, to help find the market price for the new application; for others, to speculate on the venture. As I will discuss, whether a transaction in a coin or token on the secondary market amounts to an offer or sale of a security requires a careful and fact-sensitive legal analysis.

I believe some industry participants are beginning to realize that, in some circumstances, it might be easier to start a blockchain-based enterprise in a more conventional way. In other words, conduct the initial funding through a registered or exempt equity or debt offering and, once the network is up and running, distribute or offer blockchain-based tokens or coins to participants who need the functionality the network and the digital assets offer. This allows the tokens or coins to be structured and offered in a way where it is evident that purchasers are not making an investment in the development of the enterprise.

Returning to the ICOs I am seeing, strictly speaking, the token -- or coin or whatever the digital information packet is called -- all by itself is not a security, just as the orange groves in Howey were not. Central to determining whether a security is being sold is how it is being sold and the reasonable expectations of purchasers. When someone buys a housing unit to live in, it is probably not a security. But under certain circumstances, the same asset can be offered and sold in a way that causes investors to have a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others. For example, if the housing unit is offered with a management contract or other services, it can be a security. Similarly, when a CD, exempt from being treated as a security under Section 3 of the Securities Act, is sold as a part of a program organized by a broker who offers retail investors promises of liquidity and the potential to profit from changes in interest rates, the Gary Plastic case teaches us that the instrument can be part of an investment contract that is a security.

The same reasoning applies to digital assets. The digital asset itself is simply code. But the way it is sold -- as part of an investment; to non-users; by promoters to develop the enterprise -- can be, and, in that context, most often is, a security -- because it evidences an investment contract. And regulating these transactions as securities transactions makes sense. The impetus of the Securities Act is to remove the information asymmetry between promoters and investors. In a public distribution, the Securities Act prescribes the information investors need to make an informed investment decision, and the promoter is liable for material misstatements in the offering materials. These are important safeguards, and they are appropriate for most ICOs. The disclosures required under the federal securities laws nicely complement the Howey investment contract element about the efforts of others. As an investor, the success of the enterprise -- and the ability to realize a profit on the investment -- turns on the efforts of the third party. So learning material information about the third party -- its background, financing, plans, financial stake and so forth -- is a prerequisite to making an informed investment decision. Without a regulatory framework that promotes disclosure of what the third party alone knows of these topics and the risks associated with the venture, investors will be uninformed and are at risk.

But this also points the way to when a digital asset transaction may no longer represent a security offering. If the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized -- where purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts -- the assets may not represent an investment contract. Moreover, when the efforts of the third party are no longer a key factor for determining the enterprise's success, material information asymmetries recede. As a network becomes truly decentralized, the ability to identify an issuer or promoter to make the requisite disclosures becomes difficult, and less meaningful.

And so, when I look at Bitcoin today, I do not see a central third party whose efforts are a key determining factor in the enterprise. The network on which Bitcoin functions is operational and appears to have been decentralized for some time, perhaps from inception. Applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to the offer and resale of Bitcoin would seem to add little value. And putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. And, as with Bitcoin, applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to current transactions in Ether would seem to add little value. Over time, there may be other sufficiently decentralized networks and systems where regulating the tokens or coins that function on them as securities may not be required. And of course there will continue to be systems that rely on central actors whose efforts are a key to the success of the enterprise. In those cases, application of the securities laws protects the investors who purchase the tokens or coins.

I would like to emphasize that the analysis of whether something is a security is not static and does not strictly inhere to the instrument. Even digital assets with utility that function solely as a means of exchange in a decentralized network could be packaged and sold as an investment strategy that can be a security. If a promoter were to place Bitcoin in a fund or trust and sell interests, it would create a new security. Similarly, investment contracts can be made out of virtually any asset (including virtual assets), provided the investor is reasonably expecting profits from the promoter's efforts.

Let me emphasize an earlier point: simply labeling a digital asset a “utility token” does not turn the asset into something that is not a security. I recognize that the Supreme Court has acknowledged that if someone is purchasing an asset for consumption only, it is likely not a security. But, the economic substance of the transaction always determines the legal analysis, not the labels. The oranges in Howey had utility. Or in my favorite example, the Commission warned in the late 1960s about investment contracts sold in the form of whisky warehouse receipts. Promoters sold the receipts to U.S. investors to finance the aging and blending processes of Scotch whisky. The whisky was real -- and, for some, had exquisite utility. But Howey was not selling oranges and the warehouse receipts promoters were not selling whisky for consumption. They were selling investments, and the purchasers were expecting a return from the promoters' efforts.

Promoters and other market participants need to understand whether transactions in a particular digital asset involve the sale of a security. We are happy to help promoters and their counsel work through these issues. We stand prepared to provide more formal interpretive or no-action guidance about the proper characterization of a digital asset in a proposed use. In addition, we recognize that there are numerous implications under the federal securities laws of a particular asset being considered a security. For example, our Divisions of Trading and Markets and Investment Management are focused on such issues as broker-dealer, exchange and fund registration, as well as matters of market manipulation, custody and valuation. We understand that market participants are working to make their services compliant with the existing regulatory framework, and we are happy to continue our engagement in this process.

What are some of the factors to consider in assessing whether a digital asset is offered as an investment contract and is thus a security? Primarily, consider whether a third party -- be it a person, entity or coordinated group of actors -- drives the expectation of a return. That question will always depend on the particular facts and circumstances, and this list is illustrative, not exhaustive:

    . Is there a person or group that has sponsored or promoted the creation and sale of the digital asset, the efforts of whom play a significant role in the development and maintenance of the asset and its potential increase in value?
    . Has this person or group retained a stake or other interest in the digital asset such that it would be motivated to expend efforts to cause an increase in value in the digital asset? Would purchasers reasonably believe such efforts will be undertaken and may result in a return on their investment in the digital asset?
    . Has the promoter raised an amount of funds in excess of what may be needed to establish a functional network, and, if so, has it indicated how those funds may be used to support the value of the tokens or to increase the value of the enterprise? Does the promoter continue to expend funds from proceeds or operations to enhance the functionality and/or value of the system within which the tokens operate?
    . Are purchasers “investing,” that is seeking a return? In that regard, is the instrument marketed and sold to the general public instead of to potential users of the network for a price that reasonably correlates with the market value of the good or service in the network?
    . Does application of the Securities Act protections make sense? Is there a person or entity others are relying on that plays a key role in the profit-making of the enterprise such that disclosure of their activities and plans would be important to investors? Do informational asymmetries exist between the promoters and potential purchasers/investors in the digital asset?
    . Do persons or entities other than the promoter exercise governance rights or meaningful influence?

While these factors are important in analyzing the role of any third party, there are contractual or technical ways to structure digital assets so they function more like a consumer item and less like a security. Again, we would look to the economic substance of the transaction, but promoters and their counsels should consider these, and other, possible features. This list is not intended to be exhaustive and by no means do I believe each and every one of these factors needs to be present to establish a case that a token is not being offered as a security. This list is meant to prompt thinking by promoters and their counsel, and start the dialogue with the staff -- it is not meant to be a list of all necessary factors in a legal analysis.

. Is token creation commensurate with meeting the needs of users or, rather, with feeding speculation?
. Are independent actors setting the price or is the promoter supporting the secondary market for the asset or otherwise influencing trading?
. Is it clear that the primary motivation for purchasing the digital asset is for personal use or consumption, as compared to investment? Have purchasers made representations as to their consumptive, as opposed to their investment, intent? Are the tokens available in increments that correlate with a consumptive versus investment intent?
. Are the tokens distributed in ways to meet users' needs? For example, can the tokens be held or transferred only in amounts that correspond to a purchaser's expected use? Are there built-in incentives that compel using the tokens promptly on the network, such as having the tokens degrade in value over time, or can the tokens be held for extended periods for investment?
. Is the asset marketed and distributed to potential users or the general public?
. Are the assets dispersed across a diverse user base or concentrated in the hands of a few that can exert influence over the application?
. Is the application fully functioning or in early stages of development?


These are exciting legal times and I am pleased to be part of a process that can help promoters of this new technology and their counsel navigate and comply with the federal securities laws.

=== Discussion Questions ===

. Is a digital asset a security under the Howey test, or is the transaction of sale for the digital asset an investment contract under the Howey test?
. Bill Hinman stated that he wanted to discuss when a token that is originally created as a security is no longer a security.  Does this phrasing make sense to you?  Does this transition make sense?

[underline]#**MEMORANDUM AND ORDER**#

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contends that LBRY, Inc. offered and sold unregistered securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. LBRY responds that it does not need to comply with the Securities Act because its alleged security, a blockchain token called LBC, is not a security at all. Instead, it argues that LBC functions as a digital currency that is an essential component of the LBRY Blockchain. LBRY also a sserts that the SEC's attempt to treat LBC as a security violates its right to due process because the agency did not give LBRY fair notice that its offerings of LBC are subject to the securities laws. The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment addressing both issues

The nascent technology known as blockchain operates in the background of this dispute. From its earliest days, proponents of blockchain technology have envisioned it as fundamentally altering many aspects of modern life. See Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (2008), https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf[] (outlining the idea for a peer-topeer electronic payment system). As LBRY explains, a blockchain is essentially a “decentralized ledger maintained by a network of independently owned computers.” See Kauffman Decl., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Doc. No. 61-3] at 2 ¶ 5. Verified data is held in decentralized “block[s]” linked together via cryptographic consensus protocols.

.. The Development of the LBRY Network + 
 	LBRY began as an effort to harness blockchain technology to allow users to share videos, images, and other digital content without a centralized host such as YouTube. [underline]#See# Def.'s Mem., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791680[Doc. No. 61-1] at 3. LBRY asserts that its LBRY Network is “the first decentralized, open-source, fully encrypted content distribution service built using the same blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin.” [underline]#See# Introducing LBRY: The Bitcoin of Content, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791688[Doc. No. 61-9] at 1. The LBRY Network is comprised of three components: “(1) the LBRY Blockchain, (2) the LBRY Data Network, and (3) the applications layer[.]” Kauffman Decl., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Doc. No. 61-3] at 3 ¶ 11. LBRY developed the “LBRY Desktop Application” to run on the LBRY Network.xref:#sec_v_lbry_footnote_1[*^_(i)_^*]  link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Id.] at 9 ¶ 26. LBRY has also developed other applications to run on the network, as have other thirdparty developers. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Id.] at 4 ¶ 11. LBRY Credits, or LBC, is the native digital token of the LBRY Blockchain. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Id.] at 4 ¶ 12. It is used to compensate miners, but it can also be spent on the LBRY Blockchain to publish content, create “channel[s]” that associate content with a single user, tip content creators, purchase paywall content, or “boost[]” channels or content in search results. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[id.] at 5-6 ¶ 17. Users generally must pay a fee in LBC in order to “interact with the LBRY Network for anything beyond viewing free content.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Id.] at 4 ¶ 12. +	
 	The LBRY Network was designed to eventually have a circulation of approximately 1 billion LBC. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[id.] at 4 ¶ 13. Most of the LBC will be released in the future to compensate miners, but when the LBRY Blockchain launched in June 2016, LBRY reserved a “pre-mine” of 400 million LBC for itself. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[id.] at 5-6 ¶¶ 14-15; [underline]#see also# Kauffman Dep., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792048[Doc. No. 62-20] at 5. It then sorted its LBC into three buckets: (1) 200 million into a “Community Fund,” to be used for “spreading usage and adoption” of the Network by “rewarding early adopters,” “recruiting producers,” and “rewarding contributors to the community”; (2) 100 million into an “Institutional Fund,” to allow for “the formation of institutional partnerships, as well as for grants and donations to nonprofits and other [NGOs] with similar values as LBRY”; and (3) 100 million into the aptly named “Operational Fund,” to be used for “operational purposes.” [underline]#See# Kauffman Decl., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Doc. No. 61-3] at 5 ¶ 14.  +
	LBRY's co-founders largely self-funded their initial development efforts, but they did raise “a small amount of funds from a number of angel investors.” [underline]#See# Def.'s Mem., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791680[Doc. No. 61-1] at 5. In September 2016, the company also obtained $500,000 in debt financing through Pillar VC, a venture capital firm. [underline]#See# Kauffman Decl., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Doc. No. 61-3] at 9 ¶ 29. Since then, LBRY has largely relied on sales and transfers of LBC to fund its operations. [underline]#See# 9/28/2016 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791450[Doc. No. 57-8]. +
	To date, the company has spent approximately half of its pre-mined LBC through various transactions. [underline]#See# Kauffman Decl., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Doc.

 . ANALYSIS +
 To establish a prima facie violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act, the SEC must prove that LBRY offered or sold securities in interstate commerce without filing a registration statement. [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iedab2640c58d11ecbf45df569f0c2bfa/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_8173_939++[SEC v.

Kahlon, 873 F.3d 500, 504 (5th Cir. 2017)]. LBRY does not challenge the SEC's contention that it offered and sold LBC in interstate commerce without registering its offerings with the SEC. Nor does it argue that its past offerings fall within an exemption to the registration requirement. Thus, the only issues impeding a finding that LBRY violated Section 5 are LBRY's claim that it did not offer LBC as a security and its argument that it was not given fair notice that it needed to register its offerings. I address each issue in turn.

.. Did LBRY Offer LBC as a Security? +
When Congress adopted the Securities Act, “it enacted a definition of ‘security’ sufficiently broad to encompass virtually any instrument that might be sold as an investment.” link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I5dff0cc59c9011d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_780_60++[Reves v.

Here, only the third component of the Howey test is in dispute. Thus, the issue to be decided is whether the economic realities surrounding LBRY's offerings of LBC led investors to have “a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.”xref:#sec_v_lbry_footnote_2[*^_(ii)_^*] [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iab8f1e949bf011d991d0cc6b54f12d4d/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_780_852++[Forman, 421 U.S. at 852]. I analyze the evidence that bears on this issue by first examining LBRY's representations to prospective purchasers and the company's business model. I then turn to LBRY's argument that it has not offered LBC as a security because some purchasers acquired LBC for use on the LBRY Network.
[numeric]
... LBRY's Representations to Potential Purchasers +
The SEC identifies multiple statements by LBRY that it claims led potential investors to reasonably expect that LBC would grow in value as the company continued to oversee the development of the LBRY Network. LBRY minimizes the significance of these statements, and points to its many disclaimers that it did not intend for LBC to be purchased as an investment, but the SEC is correct. LBRY has - at key moments and despite its protestations - been acutely aware of LBC's potential value as an investment. And it made sure potential investors were too. +
When LBRY launched the LBRY Network in June 2016, LBC's market capitalization was a healthy $140 million. [underline]#See# 7/15/2016 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[Doc. No. 57-11]. This, despite the Network's relative infancy and limited usability. By the following month, LBC's market capitalization had ballooned to $1.2 billion. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[Id.] In response, LBRY issued a blog post reflecting on LBC's skyrocketing value. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] +
LBRY captioned the post: “1.2B Market Cap and We Don't Care.” Id. It began by touting the rapid growth in LBC's value, but frankly acknowledged that it could not say whether the current valuation was justified. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] At that point, only three videos were available on the blockchain, each produced by LBRY itself. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] And LBRY's staff were hard at work “frantically debugging” and developing its product. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] What LBRY did claim to know though was “that the long-term value proposition of LBRY is tremendous, but also dependent on our team staying focused on the task at hand: building this thing.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] It then closed the post by announcing a policy of neutrality with respect to LBC's price but plainly stating that “[o]ver the long-term, the interests of LBRY and the holders of [LBC] are aligned.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] +
In August 2016, the COO of LBRY, Josh Finer, emailed a potential investor explaining that the company was “currently negotiating private placements of LBC with several [other] investors” and asked the recipient to write him back “if there is interest” so the two could “chat.” [underline]#See# COO Email, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[Doc. No. 59-7].xref:#sec_v_lbry_footnote_3[*^_(iii)_^*] The thrust of the email (subject line: “LBRY Credits Now Trading – LBC”) is clear. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[id.] After briefly noting that the platform was up and running, the COO explained how LBC are being traded on “major crypto exchanges” and that trading volume is moving at a healthy clip. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[id.] The “opportunity is obvious,” wrote the COO, “buy a bunch of credits, put them away safely, and hope that in 1-3 years we've appreciated even 10% of how much Bitcoin has in the past few years.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[id.] He wraps up by pitching LBRY's commitment to building its Network: “[i]f our product has the utility we plan, the credits should appreciate accordingly.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[id.] + 
 By November 2016, LBC's price was down, and some LBC investors were getting jittery. Jeremy Kauffman, LBRY's CEO, published a blog post titled “Acryptypical: The CEO of LBRY on the price of LBC,” outlining his view of LBRY's condition and providing “a canonical answer to questions about the price of LBC.” [underline]#See# 11/15/2016 Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[Doc. No. 57-21]. LBC's price was low, he contended, because of simple economics: the supply of LBC entering circulation through mining was outpacing the demand for new tokens. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] And demand was low because, at that point, “there [was] no reason to buy” LBC. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] When LBRY launched, Kauffman explained, it was “the barest, minimum proof-of-concept [application] possible.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] +
 Although it had only been a few months since the launch, LBRY still stressed its long-term goal of “buil[ding] a product that is compelling enough to change people's habits,” replacing “YouTube” and “Amazon.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] And while investors were unlikely to make a “quick buck,” Kauffman encouraged them to “hold onto [their LBC] (or spend it to buy some of [LBRY's] great content . . . .).” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] LBRY's message was clear: We are a work in progress. LBC reflects that. Bear with us.  +
 In another communication, this time on Reddit, a user who was “trying to do [their] research before putting in [their] money” asked some general questions about how LBRY would manage its holdings of LBC. [underline]#See# Reddit Thread, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791462[Doc. No. 57-20]. In response, LBRY's Community Manager explained that the only way LBC will be “worth something in the future is if LBRY delivers on their promises to create a revolutionary way to share and monetize content.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791462[id.] The thread also includes another Redditor advising the community manager on what information “would help people with their investment decisions.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791462[id.] + 
 Another relevant representation came in an interview with Mike Vine, LBRY's “Technology Evangelist”. [underline]#See# Vine Interview, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791461[Doc. No. 57-19]. Vine explained how the future “value of LBRY credits” would depend on “the success of our media marketplace.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791461[id.] When the interviewer asked how LBRY would keep “stolen[,] . . . unsavory, or downright illegal” content from the protocol, Vine's response betrayed LBRY's powerbroking role within its ecosystem by explaining that LBRY might be able to use its “position as the ‘market maker’ of [LBC] to basically make it more expensive for people to abuse the network.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791461[id.]  +
In January 2018, Kauffman wrote further on the benefits of blockchain technology in another essay entitled “Blockchain is Love, Blockchain is Life.” 
[underline]#See# 1/10/2018 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[Doc. No. 57-16]. There, he wrote about what he called the “incentive problem[]” in developing open-source alternatives to existing technologies that are controlled by private companies. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[id.] One solution to this problem, as Kauffman saw it, was to be found in blockchain technology, which allowed for blockchain tokens to be used to realign incentives. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[id.] Because a blockchain token “has value in proportion to the usage and success of the network,” developers are incentivized to work to develop and promote new uses for blockchain. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[Id.] As Kauffman put it: +
`_"It means that the people who discover and utilize a new protocol or network when it's just getting off the ground can reap substantial value by being there first. This solves the incentive problems around being a first-mover and softens the pain of using a service that probably won't be as feature-rich or slick as established competitors' options. It provides a source of funding for the development of the protocol. The creators can use the token to pay for the salaries and equipment required to get it started."_` +
link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[Id.] +
And in yet another post, this time in October 2020, LBRY provided another positive update. [underline]#See# 10/14/2020 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[Doc. No. 57-24]. It explained that it still saw itself as meeting the consumer “demand for a userowned and controlled alternative to YouTube and big tech.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[id.] Indeed, its work creating a “compelling token economy centered around digital content exchange” was still “imminently achievable” with just “some tweaks.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[id.] LBRY also touted the enormous potential it saw in continuing to develop its application on its blockchain. Other blockchain companies, the post asserted, are forced to rely on “some third-party” to “magicly [sic] build a world-class application” on their blockchains. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[id.] Not LBRY. And since “[a]pplications used by billions of people can be worth trillions of dollars,” LBRY was uniquely poised to “deliver that value” by “own[ing] the whole stack.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[id.]  +
 	These statements are representative of LBRY's overall messaging about the growth potential for LBC, and thus the SEC is correct that potential investors would understand that LBRY was pitching a speculative value proposition for its digital token. LBRY's messaging amounts to precisely the “not-very-subtle form of economic inducement” the First Circuit identified in [underline]#SG# as evidencing [underline]#Howey's# “expectation of profits.” [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I13202b1079bf11d9ac1ffa9f33b6c3b0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_54++[SG Ltd., 265 F.3d at 54-55]. +
 	LBRY does not disavow its statements regarding LBC's value or price, but notes that the statements the SEC identifies constitute only 0.25% of “the total number of posts and messages the company has published since its inception.” [underline]#See# Def.'s Obj., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845[Doc. No. 74] at 5. But this statistic relies on a misleading denominator. Of course, like many other companies, LBRY regularly publishes statements on a range of topics, and could not argue that the 8,805 tweets it identified having posted, [underline]#see# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845[id.], all pertain in equal measure to its views of LBC's long-term value proposition. Since LBRY makes no effort to tally the number of comparable statements to those identified by the SEC, its argument lacks weight.  +
LBRY also relies on the fact that it informed some potential purchasers of LBC that the company was not offering its token as an investment. But a disclaimer cannot undo the objective economic realities of a transaction. [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I4ba864e06e4411eaafc9a4147037e074/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_7903_365++[SEC v.

... LBRY's Business Model +
As I just laid out, LBRY made no secret in its communications with potential investors that it expected LBC to grow in value through its managerial and entrepreneurial efforts. But even if it had never explicitly broadcast its views on the subject, any reasonable investor who was familiar with the company's business model would have understood the connection. +
From its inception, LBRY's profitability turned on its ability to grow the value of LBC by increasing usage of the LBRY Network. As Kauffman explained in an October 2016 informal business plan, LBC was the means by which LBRY and other early adopters would be able to profit as use of the network increased. [underline]#See# LBRY Plan, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030[Doc. No. 62-2] at 9. This was because “[e]ach percentage of [LBC] can be thought of as having a value proportional to the sum of all information transacted through the network.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030[Id.] In other words, as demand for information stored on the blockchain increased, so too would LBC's value. Accordingly, Kauffman reasoned, “[g]iven this situation, the most reasonable path to profit is to reserve a portion of the cryptocurrency.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030[Id.] Later in the same plan, he discussed the company's liquidation value by stating “[s]ince LBRY's most significant asset will be its credits, it could simply liquify these credits at a return of 10-10,000x on any investment.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030[Id.] at 10. +
 Similarly, in a post on its website titled “Answers to Big Questions From our Reddit AMA,” LBRY responded to the question “How does the company behind LBRY make money?” by stating:  +
`_"The LBRY protocol has a built-in digital currency that allows it to function, called LBRY Credits. These Credits are very similar to bitcoins. Having a built-in digital currency creates an opportunity for a new kind of business that has never existed: the protocolfirst enterprise . . . LBRY Inc. has reserved 10% of all LBRY Credits to fund continued development and provide profit for the founders. Since Credits only gain value as the use of the protocol grows, the company has an incentive to continue developing this open-source project."_` +
9/28/2016 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791450[Doc. No. 57-8]. +
 The problem for LBRY is not just that a reasonable purchaser of LBC would understand that the tokens being offered represented investment opportunities - even if LBRY never said a word about it. It is that, by retaining hundreds of millions of LBC for itself, LBRY also signaled that it was motivated to work tirelessly to improve the value of its blockchain for itself and any LBC purchasers. This structure, which any reasonable purchaser would understand, would lead purchasers of LBC to expect that they too would profit from their holdings of LBC as a result of LBRY's assiduous efforts. + 
 Simply put, by intertwining LBRY's financial fate with the commercial success of LBC, LBRY made it obvious to its investors that it would work diligently to develop the Network so that LBC would increase in value. As LBRY said, “[o]ver the long-term, the interests of LBRY and the holders of Credits are aligned.” [underline]#See# 7/15/2016 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[Doc. No. 57-11]. The SEC's burden is made all the easier by statements LBRY made about its managerial efforts, like how “the long-term value proposition of LBRY is . . . dependent on our team staying focused on the task at hand: building this thing.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] By its own account, LBRY expended significant managerial efforts to develop its Network and increase the value of LBC.  +
... Consumptive Uses for LBC +
LBRY's primary response to the SEC's claim starts with two generally uncontested facts: (1) LBC is a utility token designed for use on the LBRY Blockchain, and (2) some unknown number of purchasers of LBC acquired it at least in part with the intention of using it rather than holding it as an investment. Building from there, LBRY leaps to the conclusion that LBC cannot be a security even if LBRY offered it as an investment. LBRY is mistaken about both the facts and the law. +
Nothing in the case law suggests that a token with both consumptive and speculative uses cannot be sold as an investment contract. Despite LBRY's insistence to the contrary, I cannot reject the SEC's contention that LBRY offered LBC as a security simply because some LBC purchases were made with consumptive intent. Were it otherwise, the Securities Act would be unable to adapt to the “countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits” wherever a token held some consumptive utility.

Accordingly, statements from a subset of LBC holders that they purchased LBC for use on the LBRY Blockchain is of limited relevance in determining whether LBRY offered it as a security. [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I14265fa660e511deb08de1b7506ad85b/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_1021++[Warfield, 569 F.3d] at 1021 (“[W]hile the subjective intent of the purchasers may have some bearing on the issue of whether they entered into investment contracts, we must focus our inquiry on what the purchasers were offered or promised.”). +
In summary, what the evidence in the record discloses is that LBRY promoted LBC as an investment that would grow in value over time through the company's development of the LBRY Network. While some unknown number of purchasers may have acquired LBC in part for consumptive purposes, this does not change the fact that the objective economic realities of LBRY's offerings of LBC establish that it was offering it as a security.xref:#sec_v_lbry_footnote_4[*^_(iv)_^*] + 
.. Did LBRY Receive Fair Notice? +
LBRY argues that I should nonetheless deny the SEC's motion because it did not receive fair notice that its offerings were subject to the securities laws. In pressing this argument, LBRY has abandoned any broad claim that it lacked fair notice of the way in which the [underline]#Howey# test applies to digital tokens in general. Def.'s Obj., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845[Doc. No. 74] at 24. Instead, it complains that it lacked fair notice because, until the SEC brought this action, “the Commission historically and consistently focused its guidance, as well as its enforcement efforts, exclusively on the issuance of digital assets in the context of an [Initial Coin Offering] ICO.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845[Id.] +
The principal problem with LBRY's fair notice argument is that it offers nothing more to support its position than its bald claim that this is the first case in which the SEC has attempted to enforce the registration requirement against an issuer of digital tokens that did not conduct an ICO. +
LBRY does not point to any specific statement by the SEC suggesting that companies need only comply with the registration requirement if they conduct an ICO. Nor does LBRY offer any persuasive reading of [underline]#Howey# that would cause a reasonable issuer to conclude that only ICOs are subject to the registration requirement. The test outlined in [underline]#Howey# is necessarily a factspecific one, in which no single fact will likely be dispositive. While participation in an ICO may be relevant to the analysis, it will not determine the outcome in a case like this, where the undisputed evidence leaves no doubt that LBRY offered and sold LBC as a security.  +
LBRY relies on the Second Circuit's decision in [underline]#Upton v. SEC# for the proposition that the SEC may not impose a sanction for violating the securities laws “pursuant to a substantial change in its enforcement policy that was not reasonably communicated to the public.” [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_98++[75 F.3d 92, 98 (2nd Cir. 1996)]. But, as the SEC notes, the facts of [underline]#Upton# bear no resemblance to the present case. [underline]#Upton# involved an attempt by the SEC to sanction the CFO of a brokerage firm for violating an SEC rule that established a formula for setting the amount of money that the brokerage was required to maintain in a customer reserve account. link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_93++[Id.] at 93. Although it was undisputed that the brokerage had at all times complied with the “literal terms” of the rule, an administrative law judge relied on a novel interpretation of the rule by the SEC to conclude that the CFO could be sanctioned. link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_94++[Id.] at 94-96. Because the SEC did not give public notice of its new interpretation until after the brokerage had ended its offensive practice, the Second Circuit vacated the sanction imposed by the Commission. link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_94++[Id.] at 98. +
The present case is obviously quite different from the problem the court confronted in [underline]#Upton#. The SEC has not based its enforcement action here on a novel interpretation of a rule that by its terms does not expressly prohibit the relevant conduct. Instead, the SEC has based its claim on a straightforward application of a venerable Supreme Court precedent that has been applied by hundreds of federal courts across the country over more than 70 years. While this may be the first time it has been used against an issuer of digital tokens that did not conduct an ICO, LBRY is in no position to claim that it did not receive fair notice that its conduct was unlawful. 
. CONCLUSION +
As I have explained, the only issues raised by the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment are whether LBRY offered LBC as a security and whether LBRY received fair notice that it needed to register its offerings. Because no reasonable trier of fact could reject the SEC's contention that LBRY offered LBC as a security, and LBRY does not have a triable defense that it lacked fair notice, the SEC is entitled to judgment. The SEC's Motion for Summary J udgment (link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791412[Doc. No. 55]) is granted, and LBRY's Motion for Summary Judgment (link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791679[Doc. No. 61]) is denied. The Clerk shall schedule a status conference to discuss the process for resolving any remaining issues.

=== Discussion Questions ===

. In LBRY, some of the token purchases were made with consumptive intent and some token purchases were made with investment intent, does the proportion of the purchases for investment vs. consumption matter for the Howey test?  
. Would it make a difference for the Howey test if there were other organizations beyond LBRY promoting the LBC token?  
. Could LBRY have applied Bill Hinman's reasoning to argue that even though LBC was originally a security, it was no longer a security by the time of the SEC action, similar to Ethereum?

|===

*I.*

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against Zachary Coburn (“Coburn” or “Respondent”).

*II.*

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer of Settlement (the “Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

*III.*

On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission findsxref:#coburn_footnote_1[*^_(1)_^*] that:

[underline]#Summary#

. As described more fully below, EtherDelta is an online platform that allows buyers and sellers to trade certain digital assets – Ether and “ERC20 tokens” – in secondary market trading. ERC20 tokens refer to digital assets issued and distributed on the Ethereum Blockchain using the ERC20 protocol, which is the standard coding protocol currently used by a significant majority of issuers in Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”).xref:#coburn_footnote_2[*^_(2)_^*]
. EtherDelta’s website, launched by Coburn on July 12, 2016, provides a user-friendly interface to EtherDelta and resembles online securities trading platforms. For example, the website makes token “pairs”xref:#coburn_footnote_3[*^_(3)_^*] available for trading, provides access to the EtherDelta order book, and displays the current, top 500 firm bids and offers by symbol, price, and size. The website also displays account information for users of the EtherDelta platform (“Users”) (tracked by the User’s Ethereum address and maintained in an internal ledger) and provides fields for Users to input trading interest in any token pair. Users may enter orders to buy or sell specified quantities of any ERC20 token at a specified price (in Ether) and with a specified time-in-force. The website also displays to Users market depthxref:#coburn_footnote_4[*^_(4)_^*] charts and a list of confirmed trades.
. On July 25, 2017, the Commission issued its Report of Investigation Pursuant To Section 21(a) Of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO (Exchange Act Rel. No. 81207) (July 25, 2017) (the “DAO Report”). In the DAO Report, the Commission advised that a platform that offers trading of digital assets that are securities and operates as an “exchange,” as defined by the federal securities laws, must register with the Commission as a national securities exchange or be exempt from registration.
. From July 12, 2016 to December 15, 2017 (the “Relevant Period”), more than 3.6 million buy and sell orders in ERC20 tokens that included securities as defined by Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act were traded on EtherDelta, of which approximately 92% (3.3 million) were traded during the period following the DAO Report.
. As discussed further below, EtherDelta meets the criteria of an “exchange” as defined by Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 3b-16 thereunder. During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta was not registered with the Commission as a national securities exchange and it did not operate pursuant to any exemption from registration. As a result, and as discussed further below, Coburn should have known that his actions would contribute to EtherDelta’s violations and thus, under Exchange Act Section 21C(a), caused EtherDelta to violate Section 5 of the Exchange Act. 

[.text-center] 
[underline]#Respondent# 

[start=6]
. Coburn, age 31, is a resident of Chicago, Illinois. From September 2010 to June 2015, Coburn was a registered representative with a Chicago-based options trading firm that was a broker-dealer registered with the Commission. In approximately June 2015, Coburn left that firm to pursue his own business interests. In March 2016, he created EtherOpt, an online platform for trading options and, in July 2016, he created EtherDelta.xref:#coburn_footnote_5[*^_(5)_^*] In November 2017, Coburn entered into an agreement to sell EtherDelta to foreign buyers and, as of December 16, 2017, Coburn ceased to collect any fees from Users of the platform. Coburn does not currently operate EtherDelta. 

[.text-center] 
[underline]#Facts# +
[underline]#The EtherDelta Website and Hours of Operations# 

[start=7]
. As seen below, the EtherDelta website had features similar to online securities trading platforms. For each Ether/ERC20 token pair available for trading on EtherDelta, the website provided access to the EtherDelta order book and displayed the top 500 orders to buy and orders to sell, sorted by price and color (buy orders are green and sell orders are red). The website provided User account information and provided fields for Users to input deposit, withdrawal, and trading interest. The website also provided Users’ daily transaction volumes per token, market depth charts, and a list of User’s confirmed trades.
. During the Relevant Period, the EtherDelta platform was available to anyone, including U.S. persons, and had no specified hours of operation. As long as EtherDelta’s website was operational, Users could interact directly with the EtherDelta smart contract or enter orders and trade tokens through the website 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

[align="center"]
image::media/ch03-img01.jpg[]


[.text-center] 
[underline]#The EtherDelta Smart Contract# 

[start=9]
. EtherDelta’s business operations are defined and executed by EtherDelta’s “smart contract”xref:#coburn_footnote_6[*^_(6)_^*] that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain. The EtherDelta smart contract consists of coded functionsxref:#coburn_footnote_7[*^_(7)_^*] that allow for, among other things, the trading of any Ether/ ERC20 token pair.xref:#coburn_footnote_8[*^_(8)_^*] On July 8, 2016, Coburn deployed the code for the first EtherDelta smart contract, written in the programming language Solidity, onto the Ethereum Blockchain. When it was deployed, the EtherDelta smart contract created an Ethereum Blockchain address, where the smart contract “resides.”xref:#coburn_footnote_9[*^_(9)_^*]
. Because the EtherDelta smart contract runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, every interaction with EtherDelta by a User requires the User to send a message to the Ethereum Blockchain mining network to be executed on the EtherDelta smart contract.xref:#coburn_footnote_10[*^_(10)_^*] When Ethereum Blockchain miners run the EtherDelta smart contract, the smart contract applies a preexisting set of rules (i.e., its code) to given inputs. If the User’s message results in a change of state to the Ethereum Blockchain, such as through a User request to move or withdraw ERC20 tokens to and from the EtherDelta smart contract, or through a User request to trade on the EtherDelta platform, among other things, the Ethereum Blockchain miners then record that change of state, i.e., reflecting the transfer of Ether and/or ERC20 tokens to and from addresses, to the Ethereum Blockchain. If the User’s message does not result in a change of state, such as through a User request to check the balance of the User’s Ethereum address on EtherDelta, there is no change of state recorded to the Ethereum Blockchain.

[.text-center] 
[underline]#EtherDelta User Eligibility# 

[start=11]
. As a prerequisite for submitting an order to the platform, a User must first have an Ethereum wallet address that is capable of sending messages to the Ethereum Blockchain. Users may create a new wallet address through EtherDelta’s website or by using other wallet software that is compatible with EtherDelta. Users trade on EtherDelta pseudonymously by using one or more Ethereum addresses, each a unique string of numbers and letters. Users must also demonstrate that they have available ERC20 tokens or Ether to trade on EtherDelta. 

[.text-center] 
[underline]#Tokens Eligible for Trading and EtherDelta’s “Official Listings”# 

[start=12]
. Users may enter orders to buy or sell any token that is ERC20 compliant. Coburn purposely wrote the EtherDelta smart contract to include the ERC20 token coding standard and there are no rules set forth in the smart contract that limit a User from trading any particular ERC20 token on EtherDelta.
. During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta maintained a list of “official [token] listings, a select list of ERC20 Tokens that were available for trading on EtherDelta.” Prior to identifying a token as an official listing, Coburn requested certain information from a token issuer (e.g., the token’s name, associated website URL, and a paragraph describing the token) and performed his own due diligence on these tokens. Official listings appeared on a drop down menu on a sidebar on EtherDelta’s website for easy User accessibility. During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta had approximately 500 official token listings.

[.text-center] 
[underline]#The EtherDelta Order Book# 

[start=14]
. With respect to a given order, an EtherDelta User is identified as either a “maker” or “taker” on the EtherDelta platform. A maker is someone that posts an order to buy or sell a particular ERC20 token on the EtherDelta website, which signals to other Users their intention to trade a particular token at a specific price, size, and time. A taker is someone seeking to become the counterparty to a maker’s order on the platform.

Order Types and Order Entry

[start=15]
. The only order type available on EtherDelta is a limit order to buy or sell a token at a specific price. There are no market orders.xref:#coburn_footnote_11[*^_(11)_^*]  Users indicate their interest to buy or sell a token by entering a buy or sell order. At the time an order is entered, Users provide the following information onto the EtherDelta’s website: token symbol, size, price and time-in-force (measured in “blocks”).xref:#coburn_footnote_12[*^_(12)_^*] 
. Unlike other operations on EtherDelta, entering an order on EtherDelta does not change the state of the Ethereum Blockchain and, as a result, there is no gas fee (paid in Ether to the Ethereum miners) associated with entering an order on EtherDelta. Rather, all orders are stored in EtherDelta’s order book, which resides on a centralized server maintained by EtherDelta and not on the Ethereum Blockchain.xref:#coburn_footnote_13[*^_(13)_^*]  As discussed above, for each token pair, EtherDelta’s website displays only the top 500 buy and sell orders, sorted by price and order type (buy or sell). 

Order Execution and the Order Book

[start=17]
. All orders on EtherDelta must be acted upon by a taker for a trade to occur. When a taker seeks to trade with a maker’s order, the taker, through the EtherDelta website interface, clicks on an order displayed on EtherDelta’s order book and enters the size of the order. This pairs the maker’s cryptographically-signed intent to trade (i.e., the maker order) with the taker’s cryptographically-signed intent to trade (i.e., the taker’s order) and instructs the Ethereum Blockchain miners to run the EtherDelta smart contract, which automatically performs certain checks.
. No further confirmation or action is required by the taker for the taker’s message to be executed by the smart contract and for a trade to occur. The smart contract checks that the messages are valid (contain valid cryptographic signatures), confirms the conditions of the orders (i.e., orders have not expired or been canceled) and that both Users have sufficient funds and/or tokens to complete the trade. If the messages are valid and there are sufficient funds and/or tokens, the trade is executed and the smart contract will update the smart contract’s internal ledger to reflect the trade. The maker order will remain displayed on EtherDelta’s website until the miners write the trade and post it to the Ethereum Blockchain. Thereafter, information displayed on the EtherDelta order book and website is updated.
. When a taker clicks on a maker’s order, this action will automatically result in a trade unless: (1) there are insufficient funds and/or tokens to complete the trade or pay the gas fee; (2) a competing taker’s order is confirmed on the Blockchain first; (3) the maker’s order has expired; or (4) the maker or taker’s order has been cancelled.xref:#coburn_footnote_14[*^_(14)_^*]

[.text-center]
[underline]#Notices to Users#

[start=20]
. During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta Users were kept apprised of key events and other announcements regarding the platform’s operations through an official EtherDelta Twitter handle and Coburn’s posts on Reddit.xref:#coburn_footnote_15[*^_(15)_^*] Coburn also responded to User questions through an official “Gitter channel,” a public internet forum for Users and EtherDelta representatives to post written questions and answers about EtherDelta’s operations.
. In posts on Reddit, Coburn explained that: “[a]t a high level, EtherDelta functions just like a normal exchange” and “[l]ike any other exchange, EtherDelta has an order book of resting orders.”xref:#coburn_footnote_16[*^_(16)_^*] However, unlike a traditional exchange, “[t]here is no ‘exchange owner’ holding your funds. Hence, [EtherDelta is] decentralized.... Centralized exchanges won't be able to show you verified business logic [in a publicly verified smart contract].”

[.text-center]
[underline]#Platform Fees#

[start=22]
. To promote trade volume, EtherDelta did not charge a fee to a maker for placing an order. Takers, on the other hand, were charged 0.3% of a transaction’s trade volume.xref:#coburn_footnote_17[*^_(17)_^*]

[.text-center]
[underline]#Legal Analysis#

*A. EtherDelta Violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act*
[start=23] 
. Section 5 of the Exchange Act makes it unlawful for any broker, dealer, or exchange, directly or indirectly, to effect any transaction in a security, or to report any such transaction, in interstate commerce, unless the exchange is registered as a national securities exchange under Section 6 of the Exchange Act, or is exempted from such registration. Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act defines an “exchange” as “any organization, association, or group of persons, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which constitutes, maintains, or provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood, and includes the market place and the market facilities maintained by such exchange.” 15 USC § 78c(a)(1).
. Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) provides a functional test to assess whether a trading system meets the definition of exchange under Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) provides that an organization, association, or group of persons shall be considered to constitute, maintain, or provide “a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by an exchange” as those terms are used in Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act if such an organization, association, or group of persons: (1) brings together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers; and (2) uses established, non-discretionary methods (whether by providing a trading facility or by setting rules) under which such orders interact with each other, and the buyers and sellers entering such orders agree to the terms of the trade.xref:#coburn_footnote_18[*^_(18)_^*]
. A system that meets the criteria of Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a), and is not excluded under Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(b), must register, pursuant to Section 5 of the Exchange Act, as a national securities exchange under Section 6 of the Exchange Actxref:#coburn_footnote_19[*^_(19)_^*] or operate pursuant to an appropriate exemption. One of the available exemptions is for alternative trading systems (“ATSs”).xref:#coburn_footnote_20[*^_(20)_^*] Exchange Act Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) exempts from the definition of “exchange” under Section 3(a)(1) an organization, association, or group of persons that complies with Regulation ATS.xref:#coburn_footnote_21[*^_(21)_^*] Regulation ATS requires an ATS to, among other things, register as a broker-dealer, file a Form ATS with the Commission to notice its operations, and establish written safeguards and procedures to protect subscribers’ confidential trading information. An ATS that complies with Regulation ATS and operates pursuant to the Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) exemption would not be required by Section 5 to register as a national securities exchange.
. EtherDelta satisfied the criteria of Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) and is not excluded under Rule 3b-16(b). During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta operated as a market place for bringing together the orders of multiple buyers and sellers in tokens that included securities as defined by Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act. The purchasers of such digital tokens invested money with a reasonable expectation of profits, including through the increased value of their investments in secondary trading, based on the managerial efforts of others. See DAO Report; SEC v. Edwards, 540 U.S. 389, 393 (2004); SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 301 (1946). As discussed above, EtherDelta brought together orders by receiving and storing orders in tokens in the EtherDelta order book and displaying the top 500 orders (including token symbol, size, and price) as bids and offers on the EtherDelta website. EtherDelta provided the means for these orders to interact and execute through the combined use of the EtherDelta website, order book, and pre-programmed trading protocols defined in the EtherDelta smart contract. These established non-discretionary methods allowed Users to agree upon the terms of their trades in tokens on EtherDelta during the Relevant Period.
. Despite operating as a Rule 3b-16(a) system, EtherDelta did not register as a national securities exchange or operate pursuant to an exemption from such registration. Accordingly, EtherDelta violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act. 

*B. Coburn Caused EtherDelta to Violate Section 5 of the Exchange Act*
[start=28] 
. During the relevant period, Coburn founded EtherDelta, wrote and deployed the EtherDelta smart contract to the Ethereum Blockchain, and exercised complete and sole control over EtherDelta’s operations, including over the operations constituting the violations described above. Coburn should have known that his actions would contribute to EtherDelta’s violations and thus, under Exchange Act Section 21C(a), caused EtherDelta to violate Section 5 of the Exchange Act.

[.text-center]
[underline]#Respondent’s Remedial Efforts#

[start=29]
. In determining to accept the Offer, including the decision not to impose a greater penalty, the Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Respondent and cooperation afforded the Commission staff. Coburn’s efforts facilitated the staff’s investigation involving an emerging technology. 

*IV.*

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent’s Offer.

Accordingly, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, it is hereby ordered that:

[upperalpha]
. Respondent Coburn cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.
. Respondent Coburn shall pay disgorgement of $300,000 and prejudgment interest of $13,000, for a total of $313,000, to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the United States Treasury subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600.
. Respondent Coburn shall, within 10 days of this Order, pay a civil money penalty of $75,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the United States Treasury subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. §3717.
. Payments under this Order must be made in one of the following ways:
[arabic]
.. Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;
.. Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or
.. Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to: +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enterprise Services Center +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts Receivable Branch +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341 +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6500 South MacArthur Boulevard +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oklahoma City, OK 73169 +
Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying Zachary Coburn as Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Robert A. Cohen, Chief, Cyber Unit, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549, or such other person or address as the Commission staff may provide.

. Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor Action, he shall not argue that he is entitled to, nor shall he benefit by, offset or reduction of any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset"). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that he shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor Action" means a private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this proceeding.
. Respondent acknowledges that the Commission is not imposing a civil penalty in excess of $75,000 based upon his cooperation in a Commission investigation and his agreement to testify in any related enforcement action. If at any time following the entry of the Order, the Division of Enforcement (“Division”) obtains information indicating that Respondent knowingly provided materially false or misleading information or materials to the Commission or in a related proceeding, the Division may, at its sole discretion and with prior notice to the Respondent, petition the Commission to reopen this matter and seek an order directing that the Respondent pay an additional civil penalty. Respondent may contest by way of defense in any resulting administrative proceeding whether he knowingly provided materially false or misleading information, but may not: (1) contest the findings in the Order; or (2) assert any defense to liability or remedy, including, but not limited to, any statute of limitations defense.

*V.*

It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by Coburn, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other amounts due by Coburn under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by Coburn of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).

`2`. An ICO is a term that describes the offer and sale of digital assets issued and distributed on a blockchain. A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, or peer-to-peer database spread across a network, that records all transactions in the network in theoretically unchangeable, digitally-recorded data packages called blocks. Each block contains a batch of records of transactions, including a timestamp and a reference to the previous block, linking the blocks together in a chain. The system relies on cryptographic techniques for secure recording of transactions. A blockchain can be shared and accessed by anyone with appropriate permissions. The Ethereum Blockchain is an open, or permissionless, blockchain that is a record of events resulting from the execution of code (smart contracts) on the Ethereum Blockchain. ERC20 refers to a specific Ethereum token issuing protocol, formally adopted by the Ethereum network in September 2017, and used on the Ethereum Blockchain. (ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comments and 20 is the unique identification used to distinguish this coding standard from other standards.) The ERC20 token standard, created in November 2015, “allows any token on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges” and “provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.” See Fabian Vogelsteller and Vitalik Buterin, ERC-20 Token Standard, November 19, 2015, https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md. The widespread adoption of the ERC20 token standard has also led developers to design applications, such as EtherDelta, that are compatible with any ERC20 token.

`6`. A “smart contract” has been defined as: +
a computerized transaction protocol that executes terms of a contract. The general objectives of smart contract design are to satisfy common contractual conditions (such as payment terms, liens, confidentiality, and even enforcement), minimize exceptions both malicious and accidental, and minimize the need for trusted intermediaries. Related economic goals include lowering fraud loss, arbitrations and enforcement costs, and other transaction costs. +

`8`. Users who are nodes (or connected to nodes) on the Ethereum Blockchain can interact directly with the EtherDelta smart contract, which is publicly-available on github.com. Alternatively, during the Relevant Period, Users could interact with the EtherDelta smart contract through a user-friendly interface created by Coburn, called The EtherDelta Graphic User Interface (“EtherDelta GUI” or “website”) (accessible at the URL www.etherdelta.com). EtherDelta’s website, allowed Users to interact with the EtherDelta smart contract without having to be a node on the Ethereum Blockchain and without having to understand the details of blockchain technology.

|[[coburn_footnote_9]]
`9`. Only the person with access to the private key for the “administrator account” identified in the EtherDelta smart contract can alter the EtherDelta smart contract; this access was limited to changing the permissible fees or the address of the fee account. At all times during the Relevant Period, Coburn was the only person with access to that private key and therefore, was the only person that had the ability to alter the EtherDelta smart contract.

|[[coburn_footnote_10]]
`10`. Anyone can interact with the Ethereum Blockchain by transmitting a cryptographically-secured message to the Blockchain. That message can be “state-changing” in that it can request that a particular smart contract on the Ethereum Blockchain perform a certain function that results in a change of state of the Blockchain. A state-changing message is also referred to as a “Send.” Alternatively, a message can simply request information already written to the Blockchain, and not result in a change to the state of the Blockchain. That type of message is referred to as a “Call.” Any Send must first be validated and the resulting change of state recorded to the Blockchain by the “mining” activities of a network of Ethereum “miners,” which are computing nodes on the Blockchain. A Send generally requires the payment of “gas,” or a fee paid in Ether to the Ethereum miners. Generally (but not always), the speed at which a transaction is mined on the Ethereum Blockchain is determined by the amount of gas paid by the sender of a transaction to the mining network; the higher the gas price paid for the transaction, the faster a transaction is likely to be mined. The gas price is set by the sender at the time the message is sent to the network.

. Is it fair that Coburn was still required by the SEC to pay a fine for his time running EtherDelta even though he sold EtherDelta prior to the settlement.  
. If Coburn had just created a smart contract on the blockchain enabling trading of ERC20 tokens and had not created a centralized off chain trading pairs website, would he have still violated the SEC's interpretation of the securities laws?

[underline]#**COMPLAINT**#

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), for its complaint
against Caroline Ellison (“Ellison”) and Zixiao “Gary” Wang (“Wang,” together with Ellison,
“Defendants”), alleges as follows:

[.text-center]
[underline]#**SUMMARY**#
[start=1]
. From at least May 2019 through November 2022, Defendants, together with Samuel Bankman-Fried (“Bankman-Fried”) and others, engaged in a scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX Trading Ltd. (“FTX”), the crypto asset trading platform of which Bankman-Fried and Wang were co-founders, at the same time that they were also defrauding the platform’s customers.xref:#ellison_wang_footnote_1[*^_(1)_^*] FTX raised more than $1.8 billion from investors, including U.S. investors, who bought an equity stake in FTX believing that FTX had appropriate controls and risk management measures. Unbeknownst to those investors (and to FTX’s trading customers), Bankman-Fried was orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud, diverting billions of dollars of the trading platform’s customer funds for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire. Defendants were active participants in the scheme and engaged in conduct that was critical to its success.
. Throughout this period, Bankman-Fried portrayed himself as a responsible leader of the crypto community. He touted the importance of regulation and accountability. He told the public, including investors, that FTX was both innovative and responsible. Customers around the world believed his lies, and sent billions of dollars to FTX, believing their assets were secure on the FTX trading platform. But Bankman-Fried and Wang improperly diverted customer assets to Alameda Research LLC and its subsidiaries (“Alameda”), the crypto asset hedge fund that they had founded and co-owned and that Ellison ran. Wang created and participated in the creation of the software code that allowed Alameda to divert FTX customer funds. Ellison, in turn, used the misappropriated FTX customer funds for Alameda’s trading activity. And Bankman-Fried used those customer funds to make undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations.
. Working with Bankman-Fried, Defendants hid the scheme from FTX’s equity investors, including U.S. investors, from whom FTX sought to raise billions of dollars in additional funds. Bankman-Fried repeatedly cast FTX as an innovative and conservative trailblazer in the crypto markets. He told investors and prospective investors that FTX had topnotch, sophisticated automated risk measures in place to protect customer assets, that those assets were safe and secure, and that Alameda was just another platform customer with no special privileges. Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that these statements were false and misleading. In truth, Bankman-Fried and Wang, with Ellison’s knowledge and consent, had exempted Alameda from the risk mitigation measures and had provided Alameda with significant special treatment on the FTX platform, including a virtually unlimited “line of credit” funded by the platform’s customers. 
. Beyond its “line of credit” with FTX, Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, caused Alameda to borrow billions of dollars from third party lenders. Those loans were backed in significant part by Alameda’s holdings of FTT—an illiquid crypto asset security that was issued by FTX and provided to Alameda at no cost. Ellison, acting at the direction of Bankman-Fried, engaged in automated purchases of FTT tokens on various platforms in order to increase the price of those tokens and inflate the value of Alameda’s collateral, which allowed Alameda to borrow even more money from external lenders at increased risk to the lenders and to FTX’s investors and customers, all in furtherance of the scheme.
. While Bankman-Fried spent lavishly on office space and condominiums in The Bahamas, and sank billions of dollars of customer funds into speculative venture investments, his house of cards began to crumble. When prices of crypto assets plummeted in May 2022, Alameda’s lenders demanded repayment on billions of dollars of loans. Despite the fact that
Alameda had, by this point, already taken billions of dollars of FTX customer assets, it was unable to satisfy its loan obligations. Bankman-Fried, with Defendants’ knowledge, directed FTX to divert billions more in customer assets to Alameda to ensure that Alameda maintained its lending relationships, and that money could continue to flow in from lenders and other investors. Ellison then used FTX’s customer assets to pay Alameda’s debts.
. Even as it was increasingly clear that Alameda and FTX could not make customers whole, Bankman-Fried and Defendants continued to misappropriate FTX customer funds. Through the summer of 2022, Bankman-Fried, with Defendants’ knowledge, directed hundreds of millions more in FTX customer funds to Alameda, which he then used for additional venture investments and for “loans” to himself and other FTX executives, including Wang. All the while, Bankman-Fried continued to make misleading statements to investors about FTX’s financial condition and risk management. Defendants were aware that Bankman-Fried was making these statements, and knew or were reckless in not knowing that they were false and misleading. Even in November 2022, faced with billions of dollars in customer withdrawal demands that FTX could not fulfill, Bankman-Fried and Ellison, with Wang’s knowledge, misled investors from whom they needed money to plug a multi-billion-dollar hole. This brazen, multiyear scheme finally came to an end when FTX, Alameda, and their tangled web of affiliated entities filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022.

[underline]#**FACTS**#

[upperalpha, start=1]
. [underline]#**Bankman-Fried, Actively Supported by Defendants, Created a Complex Web of Entities, with FTX and Alameda at Its Center.**#

[start=18]
. In or around October 2017, Bankman-Fried and Wang founded Alameda, a quantitative trading firm specializing in crypto assets. xref:#ellison_wang_footnote_3[*^_(3)_^*]
. At inception, Alameda was focused on arbitrage trading strategies, but went on to employ other strategies including market making, yield farming (pooling of crypto assets in exchange for interest or other rewards), and volatility trading. Alameda also offered over-thecounter trading services, and made and managed other debt and equity investments. 
. At first, Bankman-Fried was responsible for trading operations, and Wang handled the engineering and programming functions. Over time, Alameda hired additional employees, including Singh (in or around December 2017), Ellison (in or around March 2018), and Trabucco (in or around 2019). By the end of 2021, Alameda had approximately 30 employees. At times, Alameda shared office space and employees with FTX. 
. Bankman-Fried remained the ultimate decision-maker at Alameda, even after Ellison and Trabucco became co-CEOs in or around October 2021. Bankman-Fried directed investment and operational decisions, frequently communicated with Alameda employees, and had full access to Alameda’s records and databases.
. Ellison was a trader at Alameda during the time Bankman-Fried acted as CEO. When Ellison became co-CEO in 2021, and continuing through November 2022, Ellison was responsible for Alameda’s day-to-day operations. Though Ellison made some trading decisions, she frequently consulted with Bankman-Fried, particularly about strategic issues and significant trades.
. In or around 2018, Bankman-Fried began work on building a crypto asset trading platform. Together with Wang and Singh, Bankman-Fried ultimately founded FTX, which began operations in or around May 2019.
. FTX offered its customers a number of services. For example:
[loweralpha]
.. FTX offered a “spot market,” a trading platform through which customers could trade crypto assets with other FTX customers in exchange for fiat currency (i.e., currency such as U.S. Dollars) or other crypto assets.
.. FTX offered “spot margin trading” services, which allowed FTX customers to trade using assets they did not have (i.e., to trade “on margin”) by posting collateral in their FTX accounts and borrowing crypto assets through the “spot market” on the FTX platform. FTX also allowed customers to lend their crypto assets to other FTX customers who would then use those crypto assets to spot trade.
.. FTX offered an off-platform (over-the-counter or “OTC”) portal that enabled customers to connect and request quotes for spot crypto assets and to conduct trades.
. Bankman-Fried was the ultimate decision-maker at FTX from the platform’s inception in or around May 2019 until he resigned as CEO on or about November 11, 2022 (“the Relevant Period”). Wang and Singh were the lead engineers responsible for writing the software code for FTX, including the code that allowed for the services described above.
. In or around January 2020, Bankman-Fried, Wang, and Singh founded FTX US, a crypto asset trading platform designed primarily for customers in the United States.xref:#ellison_wang_footnote_4[*^_(4)_^*]
. Over time, Bankman-Fried expanded his holdings to include a number of companies focused on making and managing private (or “venture”) investments.
. This interconnected web of companies grew to include over 100 separate entities, with Bankman-Fried at the top and Alameda, his crypto hedge fund, at the center. 
. Throughout the Relevant Period, in multiple public statements, Bankman-Fried held himself out as a visionary leader in the crypto industry, and touted his efforts to create a regulated and thriving crypto asset market. He conducted an intensive public relations campaign to brand himself and his companies as honest stewards of crypto.
. The reality was very different: From the start, contrary to what FTX investors and trading customers were told, Bankman-Fried, actively supported by Defendants, continually diverted FTX customer funds to Alameda and then used those funds to continue to grow his empire, using billions of dollars to make undisclosed private venture investments, political contributions, and real estate purchases.
. At the same time, throughout the Relevant Period, Bankman-Fried, with Defendants’ knowledge, solicited equity investors by touting FTX’s controls and risk management, ultimately raising at least $1.8 billion from investors in exchange for various classes of stock in FTX through multiple fundraising rounds, including raising: (1) approximately $8 million from the sale of shares of FTX Series A preferred stock, with fundraising completed in or around August 2019; (2) approximately $1 billion from the sale of shares of FTX Series B preferred stock, with fundraising completed in or around July 2021; (3) approximately $420 million from the sale of shares of FTX Series B-1 stock, with fundraising completed in or around October 2021; and (4) approximately $500 million from the sale of shares of FTX Series C stock, with fundraising completed in or around January 2022. Of this total, approximately $1.1 billion was invested in FTX by approximately 90 investors based in the United States.
. For the entire span of the Relevant Period, while raising money from equity investors, Bankman-Fried, and those speaking at his direction and on his behalf, with the knowledge of Defendants, claimed in widely distributed public forums and directly to investors that: FTX was a safe crypto asset trading platform; FTX had a comparative advantage due to its automated risk mitigation procedures; and FTX and its customers were protected from other customers’ losses due to FTX’s automated liquidation process. As discussed further herein, these statements and others were misleading in light of Bankman-Fried’s failure to disclose to FTX investors the diversion of FTX customer funds to Alameda, which he then used for his own purposes, including loans to himself. Similarly, Bankman-Fried’s statements concerning the separation of FTX and Alameda, made throughout the Relevant Period, were misleading because he did not disclose the special treatment afforded to Alameda on FTX, including its virtually unlimited “line of credit” at FTX, its ability to carry a negative balance in its FTX customer account, and its exemption from FTX’s automated liquidation process—none of which any other customer of the platform enjoyed, but which changed the risk profile of FTX. Defendants were aware that Bankman-Fried was making false or misleading statements in order to raise money for FTX from equity investors. At times, they were in close proximity to these discussions, and directly or indirectly supported Bankman-Fried in providing false and misleading information to investors.
. Bankman-Fried also misrepresented the risk profile of investing in FTX throughout the Relevant Period by failing to disclose FTX’s exposure to Alameda and, relatedly, that the collateral Alameda deposited on FTX consisted largely of illiquid, FTX-affiliated tokens, including FTT, the price of which Alameda was actively manipulating. In addition to these material omissions, Bankman-Fried also made material misrepresentations to FTX investors about FTX’s risk management and its relationship with Alameda. As detailed below, Bankman-Fried made these material misstatements throughout the Relevant Period, and the entire time he was raising or attempting to raise funds for FTX—from the time FTX began operations in May 2019 through its ultimate demise in November 2022. Again, Defendants were aware that Bankman-Fried was making these false or misleading statements and that he was doing so in order to raise money from equity investors, and they directly or indirectly supported him in doing so.

. [underline]#**Defendants Used Alameda to Carry Out the Fraudulent Scheme.**#

[start=34]
. Alameda (and its many subsidiaries) served a number of essential functions in Bankman-Fried’s growing web of companies. For example, Alameda was the primary market maker on FTX at the time of FTX’s inception in 2019. In this capacity, Alameda, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, was tasked with creating liquidity on FTX to allow the platform to function more efficiently. Bankman-Fried also made venture investments through an Alameda subsidiary. Most crucially, Bankman-Fried used Alameda to house FTX customer assets and to deploy those assets, under Bankman-Fried’s direction, to help grow his empire.
. From the inception of FTX, Defendants and Bankman-Fried diverted FTX customer funds to Alameda, and continued to do so until FTX’s collapse in November 2022.
. Defendants and Bankman-Fried diverted FTX customer funds to Alameda in essentially two ways: (1) by directing FTX customers to deposit fiat currency (e.g., U.S. Dollars) into bank accounts controlled by Alameda; and (2) by enabling Alameda to draw down from a virtually limitless “line of credit” at FTX, which was funded by FTX customer assets.
. As a result, there was no meaningful distinction between FTX customer funds and Alameda’s own funds. Bankman-Fried and Wang thus gave Alameda and Ellison carte blanche to use FTX customer assets for Alameda’s trading operations and for whatever other purposes Bankman-Fried and Ellison saw fit. In essence, Bankman-Fried and Wang placed billions of dollars of FTX customer funds into Alameda. Bankman-Fried then used Alameda as his personal piggy bank to buy luxury condominiums, support political campaigns, and make private investments, among other uses. Ellison used these funds for Alameda’s operations, including speculative trading strategies and servicing Alameda’s debt to third-party lenders. Defendants knew that none of this was disclosed to FTX equity investors or to the platform’s trading customers.

[lowerroman, start=1]
. **FTX Customers Deposited Billions of Dollars into Alameda-Owned Bank Accounts, Which Alameda Spent on Its Own Trading Operations and to Expand Bankman-Fried’s Empire.**

[start=38]
. From the start of FTX’s operations in or around May 2019 until at least 2021, FTX customers deposited fiat currency (e.g., U.S. Dollars) into bank accounts controlled by Alameda. Billions of dollars of FTX customer funds were so deposited into Alameda-controlled bank accounts. Ellison was aware that Alameda was receiving FTX customer funds.
. At least some of these bank accounts were not in Alameda’s name, but rather in the name of North Dimension Inc. (“North Dimension”), an Alameda subsidiary. North Dimension’s website does not disclose any connection to Alameda. Ellison knew that Bankman- Fried had directed FTX to have customers send funds to North Dimension in an effort to hide the fact that the funds were being sent to an account controlled by Alameda.
. Alameda did not segregate these customer funds, but instead commingled them with its other assets, and used them indiscriminately to fund its trading operations and Bankman-Fried’s other ventures.
. This multi-billion-dollar liability was reflected in an internal account in the FTX database that was not tied to Alameda but was instead called “fiat@ftx.com.” Characterizing the amount of customer funds sent to Alameda as an internal FTX account had the effect of concealing Alameda’s liability in FTX’s internal systems. Defendants knew that FTX customer funds were being sent to Alameda-controlled bank accounts and that Alameda’s liability was reflected in the “fiat@ftx.com” account.
. In quarterly balance sheets that Ellison prepared, and that were provided to Alameda’s third-party lenders, Alameda tracked this liability as a “loan,” but did not specify that the “loan” was from FTX. Instead, Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, combined this liability with loans Alameda had received from third-party lenders to obscure Alameda’s intertwined financial relationship with FTX.
. Alameda was not required to pay interest on the liability reflected in the “fiat@ftx.com” account.
. In 2022, FTX began trying to separate Alameda’s portion of the liability in the “fiat@ftx.com” account from the portion that was attributable to FTX (i.e., to separate out customer deposits sent to Alameda-controlled bank accounts from deposits sent to FTXcontrolled bank accounts). Alameda’s portion—which amounted to more than $8 billion in FTX customer assets that had been deposited into Alameda-controlled bank accounts—was initially moved to a different account in the FTX database. However, because this change caused FTX’s internal systems to automatically charge Alameda interest on the more than $8 billion liability, Bankman-Fried directed that the Alameda liability be moved to an account that would not be charged interest. This account was associated with an individual that had no apparent connection to Alameda. As a result, this change had the effect of further concealing Alameda’s liability in FTX’s internal systems.

[lowerroman, start=2]
. **The FTX Platform, By Design, Granted Special Treatment to Alameda, Including Features that Allowed Alameda to Divert FTX Customer Assets.**

[start=45]
. In addition to receiving cash deposits directly from FTX customers, Alameda benefited from undisclosed features of the FTX platform, which were embedded in software code developed by Wang and other FTX engineers, and which allowed Alameda to divert FTX customer assets. For example:
[loweralpha]
.. Negative Balance: Alameda was able to maintain a negative balance in its customer account at FTX. Bankman-Fried directed FTX engineers, including Wang, to write software code in or around August 2019, and to update it in or around May 2020, ultimately allowing Alameda to maintain a negative balance in its account, untethered from any collateral requirements. No other customer account at FTX was permitted to maintain a negative balance.
.. Line of Credit: On multiple occasions, Bankman-Fried directed FTX engineers, including Wang, to increase the amount by which Alameda could maintain a negative balance in its account. In effect, this gave an unofficial “line of credit” to Alameda, since Alameda was able to draw down on its FTX customer account and use those funds—which were actually the funds deposited by other FTX customers—for its own trading. At Bankman-Fried’s direction, Wang and others  continually raised the limit on Alameda’s “line of credit” to the point where it grew to tens of billions of dollars and effectively became limitless. No other FTX customer had a similar “line of credit.”
.. Liquidation Exemption: In or around May 2020, Bankman-Fried directed FTX engineers, including Wang, to exempt Alameda from the “auto-liquidation” feature of FTX’s spot margin trading services. As a result, Alameda’s collateral
could fall below the requisite margin levels without triggering the automatic liquidation of its account. Alameda was the only customer exempted from FTX’s automatic account liquidation.
. Defendants were both aware that these special privileges were afforded to Alameda—and only Alameda. Defendants were also both aware that the existence of these special privileges, which were put in place at Bankman-Fried’s direction, were hidden from FTX’s investors. These privileges permitted Alameda to draw on FTX customer assets to a virtually unlimited extent for its own uses. Because its own FTX trading account was able to maintain a negative balance of billions of dollars, unbacked by sufficient collateral—as a direct result of software code implemented by Wang and others—Alameda was able to divert billions of dollars in FTX customer assets. Alameda and Ellison did just that in 2022.

[lowerroman, start=3]
. **In 2022, Alameda Diverted Billions More in FTX Customer Assets.**

[start=47]
. Starting in or around 2021, Bankman-Fried directed Ellison to have Alameda borrow billions of dollars from third-party crypto asset lending firms in order to fund Bankman-Fried’s venture investments and for his personal use. Certain of these loans included provisions permitting the lenders to demand re-payment at any time.
. In or around May 2022, as prices of crypto assets were dropping precipitously, several of these lenders demanded re-payment from Alameda. Because Alameda did not have sufficient assets to cover all of these obligations, Bankman-Fried directed Ellison to draw on Alameda’s “line of credit” from FTX, which, based on the software code that Wang had previously created, allowed Alameda to borrow virtually limitless funds from FTX. Billions of dollars of FTX customer funds were thus diverted to Alameda and used by Alameda to re-pay its third-party loan obligations.
. Because Alameda now had billions of dollars more in liability to FTX (on top of the billions of dollars reflected in the “fiat@ftx.com” account), Bankman-Fried—concerned that this enormous liability would alarm Alameda’s lenders—directed Ellison to hide this “line of credit” in Alameda’s balance sheet. Ellison did so and presented this information to lenders, knowing that it was materially misleading. 
. Despite the fact that Alameda now owed FTX billions of dollars with no immediate prospects of raising capital to pay off its “line of credit,” Bankman-Fried continued to direct Ellison to draw on the Alameda “line of credit” in the summer of 2022. The customer funds diverted to Alameda were used, among other things, to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in “loans” to Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives, as well as hundreds of millions more to fund additional venture investments.

[lowerroman, start=4]
. **Bankman-Fried, with Defendants’ Knowledge and Consent, Assured Investors that FTX Customer Assets Were Secure, and Hid Alameda’s Close Relationship with FTX.**

[start=51]
. Throughout the Relevant Period, Bankman-Fried was directly involved in soliciting potential investors in FTX. Bankman-Fried met, and otherwise communicated, with FTX investors, including investors based in the United States. Along with another FTX employee, Bankman-Fried was the point-person for investor relations at FTX. Defendants knew that Bankman-Fried was meeting with and soliciting funds from equity investors.
. FTX’s Terms of Service, which were publicly available on FTX’s website and accessible to investors, assured FTX customers that their assets were secure, providing: “you control the Digital Assets held in your Account;” “[t]itle to your Digital Assets shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to FTX;” and “none of the digital assets in your account are the property of, or shall or may be loaned to, FTX Trading.” The Terms of Service further provided: “Once we receive fiat currency we may issue you an equivalent amount of electronic money (“E-Money”)…which represents the fiat currency that you have loaded” and “[y]ou may redeem all or part of any E-Money held in your Account at any time.”
. Similarly, FTX posted on its website a document entitled, “FTX’s Key Principles for Ensuring Investor Protections on Digital-Asset Platforms,” in which FTX represented that it “segregates customer assets from its own assets across our platforms.” FTX further represented in that document that it maintained “liquid assets for customer withdrawals…[to] ensure a customer without losses can redeem its assets from the platform on demand.”
. In addition to making this document available to the public on its website, FTX specifically provided it to potential investors, including a U.S. investor who had invested $35 million in FTX’s Series B fundraising round in July 2021. As described above, these statements to the public, customers, and investors were false—FTX did not segregate its customer assets from its own assets, and, as events would later demonstrate, did not maintain liquidity to allow customer withdrawals on demand.
. FTX investors were provided with FTX’s audited financial statements, and FTX represented in its purchase agreements that those financial statements “fairly present in all material respects the financial condition and operating results of” FTX. These audited financial statements, which do not include information about Alameda’s undocumented “line of credit” from FTX and other information discussed herein, were, at the very least, materially misleading. Indeed, FTX’s current CEO has voiced “substantial concern as to the information presented in
these audited financial statements.”
. Throughout the Relevant Period, Bankman-Fried made public statements assuring that customer assets were safe at FTX. For example, he stated in a tweet on or about June 27, 2022: “Backstopping customer assets should always be primary. Everything else is secondary.” He likewise tweeted on or about August 9, 2021: “As always, our users’ funds and safety comes first. We will always allow withdrawals (except in cases of suspected money laundering/theft/etc.).”
. Bankman-Fried also told investors, and directed other FTX and Alameda employees to tell investors, that Alameda received no preferential treatment from FTX. For example, Bankman-Fried told the Wall Street Journal in or around July 2022: “There are no parties that have privileged access.” Likewise, in a Bloomberg article published in or about September 2022, Bankman-Fried claimed that “Alameda is a wholly separate entity” than FTX. In the same article, Ellison is quoted as stating about Alameda: “We’re at arm’s length and don’t get any different treatment from other market makers.” Similarly, in an interview in or about August 2022, Ellison claimed that FTX and Alameda were separate companies, that Alameda received no special treatment on the FTX platform, and that there was an ethical wall between them preventing sharing of customer information between FTX and Alameda. Bankman-Fried made similar statements directly to investors.
. Defendants were aware of the substance of Bankman-Fried’s statements about FTX customer assets—including the security of the assets and the manner in which they would be handled—and about the relationship between Alameda and FTX. Given their involvement in the fraudulent scheme outlined herein, Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that these statements to investors were false and misleading and that they were important to FTX’s investors. Defendants further knew or were reckless in not knowing that these statements were intended to make FTX more attractive to investors and potential investors. 

[upperalpha, start=3]
. [underline]#**Defendants Knew that FTX Had Poor Controls and Deeply Inadequate Risk Management Procedures, in Stark Contrast to Bankman-Fried’s Claims that It Was a Mature, Conservative Company.**#

[start=59]
. From its inception, FTX had poor controls and fundamentally deficient risk management procedures. Assets and liabilities of all forms were generally treated as interchangeable, and there were insufficient distinctions between the assignment of debts and credits to Alameda, FTX, and executives, including Bankman-Fried, Wang, and Singh. This reality was a sharp contrast to the image of FTX that Bankman-Fried consistently portrayed to the public and to investors—a mature company that managed funds and risk in a conservative, rigorous manner.
. FTX invested significant resources to develop and promote its brand as a trustworthy company. For example, in materials provided to one investor in or around June 2022, FTX cultivated and promoted its reputation:
[none]
** FTX has an industry-leading brand, endorsed by some of the most trustworthy public figures, including Tom Brady, MLB, Gisele Bundchen, Steph Curry, and the Miami Heat, and backed by an industry-leading set of investors. FTX has the leanest brand in crypto.
. FTX also promoted itself as a company that was willing to work collaboratively with regulators and lawmakers. In the same materials, FTX claimed: “FTX is also the only major digital asset venue to maintain positive, constructive relationships with regulators and lawmakers.”
. Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that the reality was far different than what Bankman-Fried presented to FTX’s investors and customers.

[lowerroman, start=1]
. **The FTX Automated Risk Engine**

[start=63]
. Bankman-Fried repeatedly touted FTX’s automated risk mitigation protocols— which he called FTX’s “risk engine”—to the public, and prospective investors, as a safe and reliable way for crypto asset trading platforms to manage risk. FTX engineers, led by Wang, developed the software code that created the “risk engine.” In essence, the software code implemented a series of rules that were designed to reduce risk in any individual client’s account by automatically triggering certain actions (e.g., to sell collateral in an account when an account was overly extended).
. Bankman-Fried promoted the concept of “24/7” automated risk monitoring as an innovative benefit of crypto asset markets, including at a hearing on or about December 8, 2021, to the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services, where Bankman-Fried concluded his remarks by stating:
[none]
** And the last thing I will say is if you look at what precipitated some of the 2008 financial crisis, you will see a number of bilateral, bespoke, non-reported transactions happening between financial counterparties, which then got repackaged and releveraged again and again and again, such that no one knew how much risk was in that system until it all fell apart. If you compare that to what happened on FTX or other major cryptocurrencies in use today, there is complete transparency about the full open interest. There is complete transparency about the positions that are held. There is a robust, consistent risk framework applied. 
. In addition to generally promoting the benefits of automated risk engines, Bankman-Fried repeatedly claimed that FTX’s own risk engine was especially sophisticated and carefully calibrated. In a submission to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, FTX touted its automated system, claiming that it calculated a customer’s margin level every 30 seconds; and that if the collateral on deposit fell below the required margin level, FTX’s automated system would sell the customer’s portfolio assets until the collateral on deposit exceeded the required margin level.
. These statements were materially false and misleading because of a critical omission: Bankman-Fried did not reveal that the automatic risk engine did not apply to the accounts of its most important customer—Alameda. As discussed above, Wang and other FTX engineers—as part of Defendants’ and Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent scheme—had created a special feature in the software code to exempt Alameda from the rules of the “risk engine.” This was a critical special benefit that Bankman-Fried afforded Alameda: Alameda’s collateral on deposit was allowed to fall below FTX’s required margin level without FTX liquidating any part of Alameda’s portfolio. Ellison was aware of, and took advantage of, this special undisclosed benefit.
. Defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Bankman-Fried’s statements regarding FTX’s risk engine misled FTX’s investors by representing that its risk engine would protect FTX customer funds and would limit FTX’s exposure to any single customer, while failing to disclose that Bankman-Fried had directed Wang to ensure that the engine not apply to one of its largest customers.
. As Bankman-Fried acknowledged in a network television interview on or about December 1, 2022: “I wasn’t even trying, like, I wasn’t spending any time or effort trying to manage risk on FTX.” Bankman-Fried continued: “What happened, happened—and, if I had been spending an hour a day thinking about risk management on FTX, I don’t think that would have happened.”

[lowerroman, start=2]
. *The Valuation of Alameda’s Collateral*

[start=69]
. The collateral that Alameda had on deposit, consisting largely of enormous positions in illiquid crypto assets issued by FTX and Bankman-Fried (including the “FTT” token, the “exchange token” for FTX, as described below), compounded the undisclosed risk to FTX’s investors.
[loweralpha]
.. Alameda Overvalued Its Collateral by Ignoring Significant Liquidity Issues.
. Defendants and Bankman-Fried valued the FTX-affiliated tokens at trading prices, but the collateral deposited by Alameda was not worth the value assigned to it. Alameda and FTX collectively owned the majority of these tokens, and only a small portion of the FTXaffiliated tokens were in circulation. As such, the tokens were illiquid, and, as Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing, if Alameda or FTX tried to sell Alameda’s holdings, market prices for the tokens would fall, thereby driving down the value of Alameda’s deposited collateral at FTX. As a result, even if FTX had liquidated Alameda’s portfolio, the sales of those thinly traded tokens would not have generated sufficient funds to cover the amount Alameda borrowed from FTX.
. Defendants and Bankman-Fried were well aware of the impact of Alameda’s positions on FTX’s risk profile. On or about October 12, 2022, for example, Bankman-Fried, in a series of tweets, analyzed the manipulation of a digital asset on an unrelated crypto platform. In explaining what occurred, Bankman-Fried distinguished between an asset’s “current price” and its “fair price,” and recognized that “large positions – especially in illiquid tokens – can have a lot of impact.” Bankman-Fried asserted that FTX’s risk engine required customers to “fully collateralize a position” when the customer’s position is “large and illiquid enough.” But Bankman-Fried knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that by not mitigating for the impact of large and illiquid tokens posted as collateral by Alameda, FTX was engaging in precisely the same conduct, and creating the same risk, that he was warning against. Defendants too knew that Alameda was drawing down on a virtually unlimited line of credit from FTX, collateralized by what they knew or were reckless in not knowing was a large illiquid position.
. The reality of FTX’s exposure to the risk created by the valuation of Alameda’s positions stood in stark contrast to Bankman-Fried’s assertions about risk management at FTX in his October 2022 Twitter analysis, in which he described FTX’s approach and claimed that constructing the rules for FTX’s risk engine in a manner that is “conservative, and handles apparent large moves gracefully” is “probably the most important thing we do at FTX.” Bankman-Fried further claimed, contrasting FTX to the failed endeavor: “There are a bunch of other risk engine protection and sanity checks, too, which would have caught something like this.”
. Not only did Bankman-Fried fail to tell investors that he had exempted Alameda from FTX’s risk engine, he also falsely told certain investors that FTX had no exposure to FTT at all. In late summer 2021, for example, Bankman-Fried told a potential U.S. investor in FTX’s series B fundraising round that FTX did not hold FTT and, consequently, the investor would not have any exposure to FTT. The investor ultimately invested $30 million. For the reasons
described above, Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing that at the time that Bankman-Fried made those representations, they were false and misleading.Specifically, Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing that any investment in FTX carried significant exposure to FTT, as the token was, among other things, posted as collateral for billions of dollars that FTX had loaned to Alameda to engage in
speculative investments. 
[loweralpha, start=2]
.. Alameda Manipulated the Market Price of FTT and, as a Result, Further Inflated the Value of Its Collateral.
. Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, caused Alameda to manipulate the price of
FTT by purchasing large quantities of FTT on the open market to prop up its price. This
manipulative activity was in furtherance of Defendants’ scheme because it allowed Ellison and
Alameda to engage in further borrowing, while concealing Alameda’s true risk exposure.
[numeric]
.. [underline]#FTT Was Offered and Sold as an Investment Contract and, Therefore, as a Security.#
. On or about July 29, 2019, FTX launched a crypto asset known as “FTT.” xref:#ellison_wang_footnote_5[*^_(5)_^*] FTX launched FTT as an “exchange token” for the FTX platform (i.e., the crypto asset or token associated with a crypto trading platform).
. Before launching the FTX platform in or around May 2019, FTX had minted 350 million FTT tokens in or around April 2019. Of the 350 million tokens minted, 175 million were allocated to FTX as “company tokens,” and 175 million were designated as non-company tokens. The company tokens were set to “unlock” (or become available for trading) over a threeyear period after a so-called initial exchange offering (“IEO”) of the token.
. From the time of its offering, FTT was offered and sold as an investment contract and therefore a security.
. Of the 175 million non-company tokens, FTX offered and sold approximately 73 million FTT in so-called “pre-sales” to investors, at prices ranging from $0.10 to $0.80. FTX raised approximately $10 million from these sales of FTT prior to the IEO. The pre-sale tokens were programmed to unlock between one to three months after the IEO. FTX did not manage separate, segregated accounts for investors, but instead pooled all proceeds from the pre-sale and the IEO of FTT and treated them interchangeably.
. FTX used the pooled proceeds from FTT sales to fund the development, marketing, business operations, and growth of FTX, depending on the success of FTX and its management team in developing, operating, and marketing the trading platform. If demand for trading on the FTX platform increased, demand for the FTT token could increase, such that any price increase in FTT would benefit holders of FTT equally and in direct proportion to their FTT holdings. The large allocation of tokens to FTX incentivized the FTX management team to take steps to attract more users onto the trading platform and, therefore, increase demand for, and increase the trading price of, the FTT token.
. As a result of FTX and its management team’s large holdings of FTT, the interests of the company and its management team were aligned with those of investors in FTT. 
. FTX’s FTT marketing materials—consisting of an FTT “whitepaper” and information posted on FTX’s website—described FTT as “the token powering the FTX ecosystem.” The publicly available information led FTT holders to reasonably expect to share in FTX’s growth and future earnings, and from appreciation in the value of FTT.
. The FTT whitepaper specifically highlighted the profit potential of the token. For example, the whitepaper included the following statements: “We launched FTX in April and already have among the world’s most liquid orderbooks” and “[o]ur goal is to become as profitable as Bitmex and OkEx within a year.” On the FTX website, FTT purchasers were offered a 5% bonus of tokens during the first three days of the IEO if they pre-funded their FTX wallets to purchase FTT, providing a potential immediate profit to investors. FTX also represented that FTT would be listed at $1.00 on July 29, 2019, and the “pre-sales” were at prices ranging from $0.10 to $0.80, which provided purchasers an immediate profit potential based on the announced listing price.
. The FTX whitepaper further explained: “We have carefully designed incentive schemes to increase network effects and demand for FTT, and to decrease its circulating supply.” The FTT materials stated that the token provided investors with fee rebates and discounts on FTX, and the ability to use the token as collateral for futures positions as well as for “margin trading” that FTX promised to launch “in the future.” The FTT materials referred to potential gains from FTX’s future repurchase and burning of FTT (the “buy and burn” program), to be funded by FTX’s revenues.xref:#ellison_wang_footnote_6[*^_(6)_^*]
. The FTX whitepaper also explained that “[c]ustomers who hold a certain amount of FTT for a period of time will receive lower FTX futures fees” and that this “will further increase demand for FTT.”
. FTT was marketed as an investment that would appreciate in value as it grew and expanded in other ways. FTX represented that it “carefully designed incentive schemes to increase network effects and demand for FTT, and to decrease its circulating supply.” These incentives included that FTT would be listed on FTX and thus could be traded, and FTX’s “buy and burn” program would purchase FTT, thus boosting demand, and then burn those purchased tokens in order to decrease the supply of FTT and increase its price.
. FTX marketed FTT by encouraging purchasers to believe that its platform would succeed and provide a return based on that success. The FTT whitepaper emphasized “Why Invest? -- All-Star Team,” and highlighted the importance of the management team’s experience and success in developing crypto asset trading systems. For example, the whitepaper stated that FTX’s “greatest strength lies in the team behind it” and touted FTX’s “Track Record of Proven Success” based on the background and experience of its management team. The FTT materials made clear that FTX’s core management team’s efforts would drive the growth and ultimate success of FTX. The whitepaper also advertised that certain features gave FTX an advantage over competing platforms, including industry-leading risk management systems and its liquidation engine model.
. FTX also marketed FTT as an asset that could be used in an “earn program” or in “staking programs” (i.e., a program promising interest payments on deposited assets), as additional ways in which investors could earn returns from FTT.
. FTX’s whitepaper tied the prospects of FTT’s investors to the growth of the FTX platform, and noted that FTX would undertake various “Strategies to Acquire Users and Grow Volume,” including the employment of influential spokespeople.
. FTX’s whitepaper also stated that “[t]here are many ways FTT will be used as we add more products and features to FTX. For instance, when we launch a spot exchange in the future, FTT will be used for initial exchange offerings.”
. As a result of the above representations and the economic reality at that time, FTT investors had a reasonable expectation of profiting from FTX’s efforts to deploy investor funds to create a use for FTT and bring demand and value to their common enterprise.
[numeric, start=2]
.. [underline]#Alameda and Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s Direction, Manipulated the Market Price of FTT.#
. In July 2019, when FTX launched FTT, Alameda received a substantial portion of the 350 million FTT tokens that were minted, including all of the “company tokens” that were allocated to FTX. Alameda did not pay for these tokens
. Alameda programmed its automated trading tools (or “bots”) to conduct trades and execute transactions to purchase FTT at specific prices. On more than one occasion, Alameda and Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, actively engaged in the trading of FTT with the goal of supporting the price of the token. On these occasions, Alameda adjusted the trading parameters of its trading bots in order to support the price of FTT.
. For example, in 2019, there was downward pressure on the price of FTT as the token was being unlocked for early-stage investors. Bankman-Fried became concerned about, among other things, the psychological effect of the price of FTT dropping below a specific threshold, and instructed Ellison to have Alameda purchase FTT to support the price and avoid that outcome. In another instance in 2021, the price of FTT was again facing downward pressure from external events, this time related to substantial sales of FTT by a third party. Bankman-Fried again instructed Ellison to have Alameda purchase FTT on trading platforms to support the price. In addition, as described further below in paragraph 106, in November 2022, Ellison engaged in further deceptive conduct to support the price of FTT.
. By manipulating the price of FTT, Ellison and Bankman-Fried caused the valuation of Alameda’s FTT holdings to be even more inflated. As described above, Alameda’s FTT holdings were a substantial part of the collateral Alameda used to borrow funds from external lenders. By overstating the value of the collateral on Alameda’s balance sheet, Ellison and Bankman-Fried concealed Alameda’s true risk exposure from those lenders, and misled investors about FTX’s risk exposure—all in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme.

.. **Loans to FTX Executives and Real Estate Purchases**
. The FTX funds transferred to Alameda were used not only for Alameda’s proprietary trading, but also to fund loans to FTX executives, including Bankman-Fried himself, and to fund personal real estate purchases. Between March 2020 and September 2022, Bankman-Fried executed promissory notes for loans from Alameda totaling more than $1.338 billion, including two instances in which Bankman-Fried was both the borrower in his individual capacity and the lender in his capacity as CEO of Alameda. Ellison knew, or was reckless in not knowing, about these “loans.”
. Bankman-Fried also used commingled funds from Alameda to make large political donations and to purchase tens of millions of dollars in Bahamian real estate for himself, his parents, and other FTX executives. Specifically, in 2020 and 2021, Wang executed promissory notes with Alameda totaling approximately $224.7 million. The funds borrowed under the promissory notes in Wang’s name were not intended for Wang’s personal use but were instead used by Bankman-Fried for other purposes, including additional venture investments. However, Wang did withdraw approximately $200,000 in funds for his own purposes.
. The loans to Bankman-Fried, Wang, and other individuals were poorly documented, and at times not documented at all. Similarly, the record keeping regarding the purchase and ownership of real estate was poorly organized and documented. Defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that neither the fact of the loans and purchases, nor the poor documentation of significant company liabilities and expenditures, was disclosed to investors.

. [underline]#**Despite the Precarious Financial Position of FTX and Alameda, Bankman-Fried and Ellison Continued to Use FTX Customer Assets in the Summer of 2022, Including to Rescue Distressed Crypto Firms and to Further Mislead Investors.**#

[start=98]
. In May 2022, the crypto markets plummeted due to a significant loss in value of certain crypto assets and networks and the collateral effects on the interrelated markets. Bankman-Fried characterized FTX, and himself, as playing an important role in stabilizing the industry. Bankman-Fried entered into a series of transactions with other members of  the industry, providing credit to and taking over other failing firms. On or about June 21, 2022, after giving a $250 million line of revolving credit to BlockFi, a global crypto financial services company, to provide the company with access to capital to ease liquidity concerns, Bankman-Fried tweeted: “We take our duty seriously to protect the digital asset ecosystem and its customers.”
. At the same time that Bankman-Fried was positioning himself as a hero in the industry, however, the plummeting value of crypto assets was impacting Alameda, and as a result impacting FTX. As discussed above, as a result of the same market conditions impacting BlockFi’s liquidity, many of Alameda’s lenders demanded repayment of loans they had made to
Alameda. Ellison, at the direction of Bankman-Fried, drew down billions of dollars from its “line of credit” from FTX to repay some of Alameda’s loans—money that came from FTX’s spot market funded by FTX customers.
. Thus, in the summer of 2022, Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that FTX was in a precarious financial condition. However, Bankman-Fried and Ellison, with Wang’s knowledge, continued to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase and support other crypto companies, and allowed Alameda to use FTX customer funds
to repay its debts. In addition, Bankman-Fried, Wang, and other FTX executives continued to withdraw customer funds in the form of the poorly documented and undisclosed “loans” described above. Specifically, on or about July 22, 2022, Bankman-Fried loaned himself $136 million and, on or about September 28, 2022, Wang signed a promissory note to Alameda for $13.7 million, which was used by Bankman-Fried for a venture investment. Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew, or were reckless in not knowing, of the significant financial risk these “loans” posed to both Alameda and FTX. Collectively, Defendants’ and Bankman-Fried’s actions in the summer of 2022 further imperiled FTX’s financial condition.
. Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that Bankman-Fried continued to present a false and misleading positive account of FTX to investors, despite FTX’s tenuous financial condition at this time. In a meeting with FTX’s U.S. investors in September 2022, for example, an FTX presentation included the claim that: “Outside of BlockFi, we didn’t increase our exposure to crypto.” This statement was false and misleading: the customer funds that FTX diverted to Alameda, including customer funds that Ellison used to repay Alameda’s lenders, were collateralized in part by Alameda’s FTT holdings. Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing that, as a result, FTX’s exposure to crypto, including its own FTT token, increased substantially as Alameda increased its borrowing, backed by FTT as collateral, in the second quarter of 2022.
. In that same meeting with FTX investors, FTX also represented that certain investments did not involve the assets of FTX or its customers. Contrary to that representation, two $100 million investments made by FTX’s affiliated investment vehicle, FTX Ventures Ltd., were funded with FTX customer funds that had been diverted to Alameda.

[upperalpha, start=5]
. [underline]#**Even as the Scheme Was Spiraling Out of Control, Bankman-Fried and Ellison, with Wang’s Knowledge, Continued to Mislead Investors and the Public About FTX’s True Financial Condition.**#

[start=103]
. On or about November 2, 2022, CoinDesk, a crypto news website, published an
article stating that based on its review of an Alameda balance sheet it had obtained, Alameda
held a large position in FTT and other FTX-associated tokens. At Bankman-Fried’s direction,
Ellison responded on Twitter to reassure investors and the public that Alameda was financially
sound. Ellison did so on or about November 6, 2022, tweeting that the balance sheet referenced
in the CoinDesk article (and elsewhere by that point) “is for a subset of our corporate entities, we
have > $10 billion of assets that aren’t reflected there.” Ellison continued: “…given the
tightening in the crypto credit space this year we’ve returned most of our loans by now.” The
tweet was designed to provide false reassurance to customers by implying that Alameda had
additional assets that meant its financial condition was stronger than the balance sheet suggested.
At the same time, the tweet omitted the fact that the balance sheet did not accurately reflect the
significant debt that Alameda owed to FTX. In contrast to the positive message in her tweet, at
that point, Ellison knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Alameda was insolvent.
. On or about November 6, 2022, the CEO of Binance, a crypto asset trading
platform, announced that “[d]ue to recent revelations that have came [sic] to light,” Binance
would liquidate its FTT holdings. Binance held FTT then valued at more than $500 million,
which it had received from FTX as part of Bankman-Fried’s buyout of Binance’s equity in FTX
as an early round investor.
. Binance’s announcement caused many FTX customers to withdraw their funds
from FTX. Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing that given
Alameda’s large FTT holdings, any further drop in the value of FTT threatened the solvency of
FTX, given Alameda’s multi-billion-dollar liabilities. With the knowledge and consent of the
Defendants, Bankman-Fried engaged in a frantic campaign to prevent this outcome by assuring
investors and the public that FTX was financially sound.
. Specifically, to prevent a collapse in the market price of FTT that Binance’s sales
might cause, Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, tweeted an offer to buy Binance’s entire
stake, for $22 per token (“@cz_binance if you’re looking to minimize the market impact on your
FTT sales, Alameda will happily buy it all from you today at $22!”). When Ellison sent this
message she knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that in order for Alameda to be able to
actually purchase Binance’s FTT for $22 per token, Alameda would have to draw down
additional funds from FTX itself, further extending its line of credit, or obtain funds from thirdparty
lenders without disclosing its own tenuous financial condition. Despite this, Ellison posted
the tweet in an effort to support and increase the price of FTT, again using Alameda to impact
the price of FTT in furtherance of Defendants’ scheme.
. Similarly, attempting to maintain public and investor confidence in FTX,
Bankman-Fried tweeted on or about November 7, 2022: “FTX is fine. Assets are fine … FTX
has enough to cover all client holdings. We don’t invest client assets (even in treasuries). We
have been processing all withdrawals, and will continue to be ….” That tweet was false and
misleading, and Bankman-Fried later deleted it. Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew that FTX,
at Bankman-Fried’s direction, had allowed Alameda to invest “client assets” and that Alameda
had in fact done so, using FTX customer funds to make investments far riskier than “treasuries.”
. The next day, November 8, 2022, FTX paused all customer withdrawals, and the
price of FTT plummeted by approximately 80%. Alameda’s collateral on deposit was worth far
less than the amount Alameda had borrowed from FTX. FTX was left with billions of dollars in
effectively unrecoverable loans.
. Facing a solvency crisis, Bankman-Fried searched for investors who could
provide additional funding. On or about November 8, 2022, the CEO of Binance tweeted: “FTX
asked for our help. There is a significant liquidity crunch. To protect users, we signed a nonbinding
LOI, intending to fully acquire http://FTX.com and help cover the liquidity crunch. We
will be conducting a full DD [due diligence] in the coming days.”
. It only took one day, however, for Binance to decide not to acquire FTX. On or
about November 9, Binance announced: “As a result of corporate due diligence, as well as the
latest news reports regarding mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations,
we have decided that we will not pursue the potential acquisition of http://FTX.com.”
. FTX customers withdrew approximately $5 billion from the platform that day.
. At the same time, Bankman-Fried sought emergency funding from other
investors, including U.S. investors, to cover a shortfall at FTX of approximately $8 billion. As
part of this effort, Bankman-Fried circulated a balance sheet to potential investors that listed a
negative $8 billion entry labeled as a “hidden, poorly internally labeled ‘fiat@ account.’” This
entry was a reference to the above-described fiat@ftx.com account and reflected FTX customer
funds deposited in Alameda’s bank accounts.
. During a meeting with Alameda employees on or about November 9, 2022,
Ellison admitted that she, Bankman-Fried, Wang, and Singh were aware that FTX customer
funds had been used by Alameda.
. On the morning of November 10, 2022, confronting the implosion of FTX and
Alameda, Bankman-Fried tweeted: “1) I’m sorry. That’s the biggest thing. I f*cked up, and
should have done better.”xref:ellison_wang_footnote_7[*^_(7)_^*] In the same tweet thread, Bankman-Fried announced that Alameda was “winding down trading” and soon would not trade on FTX at all. Bankman-Fried
maintained that “FTX International currently has a total market value of assets/collateral higher
than client deposits (moves with prices!).” And he stated, among other things, that he was trying
to “raise liquidity,” claiming “[t]here are a number of players who we are in talks with, LOIs
[letters of intent], term sheets, etc.”
. The next day, November 11, 2022, Bankman-Fried resigned from FTX. Shortly thereafter, FTX and approximately 100 affiliated entities, including FTX US, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Wang’s employment with FTX and Ellison’s employment with Alameda were terminated on or about November 18, 2022.

`1`. Bankman-Fried was charged by the Commission on December 13, 2022, in Securities and Exchange Commission v. Samuel Bankman-Fried, 22-cv-10501 (S.D.N.Y.). The allegations herein are focused on the conduct and knowledge of Ellison and Wang, as well as Bankman-Fried. Other individuals were both aware of and participated in some aspects of the fraud scheme described herein.
|[[ellison_wang_footnote_2]]
`2`. Ellison served as CEO of Alameda Research Ltd., a subsidiary of Alameda Research LLC. For clarity, as set forth
in paragraph 17, the complaint refers to Alameda Research LLC and its subsidiaries collectively as “Alameda.”
|[[ellison_wang_footnote_3]]
`3`. Crypto assets are unique digital assets maintained on a cryptographically-secured blockchain. A blockchain or distributed ledger is a peer-to-peer database spread across a network of computers that records all transactions in theoretically unchangeable, digitally recorded data packages. The system relies on cryptographic techniques for secure recording of transactions. Crypto tokens may be traded on crypto asset trading platforms in exchange for other crypto assets or fiat currency (legal tender issued by a country).
|[[ellison_wang_footnote_4]]
`4`. FTX US is the d/b/a for a subsidiary of West Realm Shires Inc., a separate legal entity from FTX Trading Ltd. that provided different services. FTX US’s conduct is not the subject of the allegations in this complaint. 
|[[ellison_wang_footnote_5]]
`5`. FTT was available for trading on FTX, but not on FTX US. 
|[[ellison_wang_footnote_6]]
`6`. Generally speaking, “exchange tokens” purport to provide incentives, benefits, and investment returns to holders and to traders on crypto asset trading platforms. For example, “exchange tokens” may offer fee discounts with respect to crypto asset trading platform fees, or offer other benefits, essentially incentivizing the platform’s traders or users to allocate additional funds to the platform’s ecosystem. Trading platforms may also offer “exchange tokens” to their customers in exchange for the customers bringing trading liquidity or other customers or funds to the platform.

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission” or “SEC”) files this Complaint against Genesis Global Capital, LLC (“Genesis”) and Gemini Trust Company, LLC (“Gemini”) (collectively, “Defendants”) and alleges as follows:

[.text-center]
[underline]#*SUMMARY*#

. Between February 2021 and November 2022, Genesis and Gemini engaged in an unregistered offer and sale of securities to U.S. retail investors, in violation of the federal securities laws. Through an investment opportunity that Defendants called the “Gemini Earn” program, investors tendered crypto assets to Genesis and, in exchange, Genesis promised to pay interest on those assets to investors. Through this unregistered offering, Defendants raised billions of dollars’ worth of crypto assets, principally from U.S. retail investors.
. Both Defendants were integral to the operation and success of the Gemini Earn program. Genesis was the issuer and entity that received, pooled, deployed, and paid interest on investors’ assets. Genesis and Gemini marketed the Gemini Earn program through social media and Gemini’s website, touting the high interest rates that investors could earn through Gemini Earn. And Gemini provided retail investors with access to Genesis, which otherwise only engaged in crypto asset transactions with large institutional and other accredited investors.xref:sec_genesis_footnote_1[^*(1)*^] Crucially, both Defendants profited from the partnership and offering. 
. To participate in the Gemini Earn program, Genesis and Gemini required that investors enter into a tri-party Master Digital Asset Loan Agreement with Genesis and Gemini (“Gemini Earn Agreement”), whereby Gemini Earn investors provided crypto assets to Genesis, with Gemini acting as the agent in the issuance. Genesis would send interest payments to Gemini, which would then deduct an “Agent Fee” before distributing the remainder of the interest payments to Gemini Earn investors.
. Genesis pooled the crypto assets from Gemini Earn investors with assets from other investors. Genesis then deployed the crypto assets – primarily by lending the crypto assets to institutional counterparties (“Institutional Borrowers”) – in order to generate revenue for its business, including the revenue necessary to pay interest to Gemini Earn investors. Genesis earned revenue by lending the crypto assets at a higher rate than it paid to Gemini Earn and other investors.
. The Genesis Earn Agreements, as offered and sold through the Gemini Earn program, were securities that Genesis and Gemini offered and sold to the investing public.
. Defendants offered and sold the Gemini Earn Agreements through the Gemini Earn Program without registering the offer and sale with the SEC as required by the federal securities laws. As a result, investors lacked material information about the Gemini Earn program that would have been relevant to their investment decisions. Instead of providing investors with the full panoply of information required by the federal securities laws, Defendants have instead only made selective and inadequate disclosures.
. The U.S. retail investors who participated in the Gemini Earn program have suffered significant harm. In November 2022, Genesis unilaterally announced that it would not allow hundreds of thousands of retail investors to withdraw their crypto assets from Gemini Earn because of “withdrawal requests which have exceeded our current liquidity” following volatility in the crypto asset market. At the time, Genesis held approximately $900 million in investor assets from approximately 340,000 Gemini Earn investors, most residing in the United States. As of the date of this Complaint, these retail investors still cannot withdraw their assets, and Genesis has formed a special committee to oversee a restructuring process.
. While the Gemini Earn program has been terminated, both Genesis and Gemini continue to do business in the crypto asset industry. In particular, Genesis intends to reengage in crypto asset lending activities. Gemini continues to hold billions of dollars’ worth of crypto assets on behalf of retail investors in connection with its trading platform and other activity in this industry. Thus, Defendants remain positioned to violate the registration provisions if they are not enjoined from doing so.

[.text-center]
[underline]#*VIOLATIONS*#
[start=9]
. By engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Defendants violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and 77e(c)].
. Unless Defendants are permanently restrained and enjoined, they will continue to engage in the acts, practices, and courses of business set forth in this Complaint and in acts, practices, and courses of business of similar type and object.

[.text-center]
[underline]#*NATURE OF THE PROCEEDING AND RELIEF SOUGHT*#
[start=11]
. The Commission brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)]. 12. The Commission seeks a final judgment: (a) permanently enjoining Defendants from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, pursuant to Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)]; (b) ordering Defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains and to pay prejudgment interest thereon, pursuant to Sections 21(d)(3), (d)(5), and (d)(7) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S. Code § 78u(d)(3), (5), (7)]; and (c) imposing civil money penalties on Defendants pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C § 77t(d)].

[.text-center]
[underline]#*JURISDICTION AND VENUE*#
[start=13]
. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)].
. Defendants, directly or indirectly, have made use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged herein.
. Venue is proper in the Southern District of New York pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)]. Gemini’s principal place of business is in this District, and Defendants sold the securities at issue in this case to investors residing in this District.

[.text-center]
[underline]#*DEFENDANTS*#
[start=16]
. *Genesis Global Capital, LLC (“Genesis”)* is a Delaware limited liability company formed in 2017 and a wholly owned subsidiary of Genesis Global Holdco, LLC, which is wholly owned by Digital Currency Group, Inc. (“DCG”). Genesis’ principal place of business is in Jersey City, New Jersey. Genesis claims that it is the “premier institutional digital asset financial services firm,”xref:sec_genesis_footnote_2[^*(2)*^] and “the world’s largest digital asset lender” and that “[h]olders of digital currencies can earn yield on their assets by lending directly to Genesis, a regulated and trusted counterparty.” Genesis is registered with FinCEN as a money services business (i.e., money transmitter). Genesis is one of several companies that DCG operates under the “Genesis” brand. Genesis is the issuer of securities under the Gemini Earn program. 
. *Gemini Trust Company, LLC (“Gemini”)* is a New York limited liability trust company founded in 2014. Gemini is beneficially owned and controlled by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss through Winklevoss Capital Fund, LLC. Gemini’s principal place of business is in New York, New York. Gemini is registered as a New York limited purpose trust company with the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYSDFS”).

[.text-center]
[underline]#*STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK*#
[start=18]
. The Securities Act sets forth a longstanding regime of full and fair disclosure in connection with the offer and sale of securities, in contrast to traditional commercial principles of caveat emptor. Congress mandated that persons who offer and sell securities to the investing public provide sufficient, accurate information to allow investors to make informed decisions before they invest.
. The definition of a “security” under the Securities Act includes a wide range of investment vehicles, including “investment contracts” and “notes.” An investment contract is an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. Congress defined “security” broadly to embody a “flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.” SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 299 (1946). According to the Supreme Court, the broad definition of “security” is “sufficient to encompass virtually any instrument that might be sold as an investment,” because “Congress’ purpose in enacting the securities laws was to regulate investments, in whatever form they are made and by whatever name they are called.” SEC v. Edwards, 540 U.S. 389, 393 (2004) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original). Courts have found that novel or unique investment vehicles constitute investment contracts, including interests in orange groves, animal breeding programs, railroads, mobile phones, and enterprises that exist only on the Internet, including crypto assets. 
. Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act require that an issuer like Genesis register the offer or sale of securities with the SEC. Similarly, those provisions prohibit Gemini from engaging in the offer and sale of such unregistered securities. Registration statements relating to an offering of securities provide public investors with material information about the issuer and the offering, including but not limited to financial and managerial information, how the issuer will use offering proceeds, and the risks and trends that affect the enterprise and an investment in its securities.

[.text-center]
[underline]#*BACKGROUND ON CRYPTO ASSETS*#
[start=21]
. The term “crypto asset” generally refers to an asset that is issued and transferred using distributed ledger or blockchain technology, including, but not limited to, so-called “cryptocurrencies,” “coins,” and “tokens.”
. A blockchain or distributed ledger is a peer-to-peer database spread across a network of computers that records all transactions in theoretically unchangeable, digitally recorded data packages. The system relies on cryptographic techniques for secure recording of transactions.

[.text-center]
[underline]#*FACTS*#

[.text-center]
[upperroman]
. [underline]#*Genesis and Gemini Offered and Sold Investments*#

[start=23]
. In March 2018, Genesis began obtaining crypto assets from large institutional and other accredited investors in exchange for a promise to pay interest on those investors’ crypto assets. Genesis obtained crypto assets from its various investors for the use of its primary business – i.e., to lend crypto assets to Institutional Borrowers for interest – which generated revenue for Genesis and allowed it to pay interest to large institutional and other accredited investors. Genesis earned profit by lending the crypto assets to Institutional Borrowers at a higher rate than it paid to its investors. Genesis pooled the investors’ crypto assets and exercised discretion over how to deploy the assets to earn income.
. Eventually, Genesis expanded its business model to transact with not just institutional and accredited investors, but also retail investors. In particular, in December 2020, Genesis entered into an agreement with Gemini to offer Gemini customers, including U.S. retail investors, an opportunity to tender their crypto assets to Genesis in exchange for Genesis’ promise to pay interest.

[.text-center]
*Gemini Earn Program*
[start=25]
. Specifically, beginning in February 2021, Genesis and Gemini began offering the Gemini Earn program to retail investors in the United States and Hong Kong, and later Singapore. There was no minimum investment amount to be eligible to participate in the Gemini Earn program. As of November 16, 2022, approximately 340,000 retail investors, most residing in the United States, had crypto assets invested with Genesis through the Gemini Earn program. By November 2022, the value of retail investors’ crypto assets held by Gemini exceeded the collective value of those tendered by institutional and accredited investors. 
. Each Gemini Earn investor entered into a tri-party Gemini Earn Agreement with Gemini and Genesis. The agreement was a standard agreement and not individually negotiated with Gemini Earn investors. Under the terms of the Gemini Earn Agreement, Gemini Earn investors first needed to hold eligible crypto assets with Gemini – either by transferring the crypto assets to Gemini or acquiring them via Gemini’s crypto asset trading platform. Through Gemini Earn, investors would then tender their crypto assets to Genesis, with Gemini acting as the agent for retail investors to facilitate the transaction. Gemini aggregated the crypto assets to be invested in the Gemini Earn program and placed them in a digital wallet from which Genesis would take possession of the assets.
. Genesis determined the types and aggregate amount of each crypto asset that were eligible to be invested by Gemini Earn investors. Genesis offered and agreed to pay the Gemini Earn investors in-kind interest on the crypto assets they had invested, which accrued on a daily basis. Genesis could unilaterally revise the interest rates and the aggregate amount of each crypto asset that Gemini Earn investors could invest, on a monthly basis.
. Gemini Earn investors’ returns came from Genesis, with Gemini deducting an Agent Fee from the returns. Genesis had sole discretion over the gross interest rate that it paid for each crypto asset, while Gemini had sole discretion over its Agent Fee and thus the net rates of return offered to Gemini Earn investors.
. Gemini published the list of crypto assets eligible for investment and the interest rates offered to Gemini Earn investors on its website as well as in Gemini’s mobile application (“app”). More than 50 crypto assets were eligible to be invested in the Gemini Earn program, including Bitcoin, Ether, USD Coin, and Dogecoin. 
. As of October 2022, the net interest rate offered to Gemini Earn investors ranged from 0.45% to 8.05%, while Gemini’s Agent Fee ranged from 0.06% to 4.29%, depending on the type of crypto asset tendered to Genesis. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, Gemini received approximately $2.7 million in Agent Fees from the Gemini Earn program. 31. The Gemini Earn Agreement provided that the crypto asset transactions were “open term” unless otherwise specified, and Gemini Earn investors could terminate all, or a portion, of their investment in Gemini Earn at any time with no withdrawal fee. Per the Gemini Earn Agreement, Genesis was also obligated to return the invested crypto assets within three business days of an investor’s request for repayment to a digital wallet controlled by Gemini, and Gemini would then transfer the crypto assets and any accrued interest to the investor’s Gemini account where the assets and interest would be available for withdrawal. The Gemini Earn Agreement also provided that Genesis was responsible for repaying the crypto assets and all accrued interest to the Gemini Earn investors.
. Under the terms of the Gemini Earn Agreement, a failure by Genesis to return crypto assets or a failure by Genesis to pay interest or late fees to a Gemini Earn investor is considered an event of default. In the event of a default, Gemini may declare the entire Gemini Earn balance payable, transfer any collateral to hold on behalf of itself and the Gemini Earn investors, and/or exercise all other rights and remedies available. If the event of default persists for 30 days or more, Gemini may terminate the Gemini Earn Agreement.

[.text-center]
*Genesis and Gemini Promoted Gemini Earn as an Investment*
[start=33]
. Genesis and Gemini both touted the profits investors could earn by investing their crypto assets with Genesis through Gemini Earn. Genesis advertised on its public website that “[h]olders of digital currencies can earn yield on their assets by lending directly to Genesis.” Genesis also published tweets highlighting its partnership with Gemini and the yield that Gemini Earn investors – i.e., retail investors – could earn. For example, on February 2, 2021, Genesis published a tweet stating, “Genesis is dedicated to building and partnering to lower barriers to digital asset markets.” 
. Gemini similarly promoted the profit that investors could earn through the Gemini Earn program. In a February 2021 press release launching Gemini Earn, Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss stated, “We designed a program that allows our customers the ability to generate a real return on their crypto holdings.” On February 27, 2021, Gemini also posted a video on YouTube titled, “Invest Better with Gemini Earn.” On its website, Gemini described how users would earn interest, noting, “We are excited to launch Gemini Earn and offer more opportunities for you to grow your portfolio and earn yield.” Similarly, Gemini advertised on its website that investors could “[p]ut your crypto to work. With Gemini Earn, you can receive up to 8.05% APY on your cryptocurrency,” and listed the interest rate that investors could earn for each eligible crypto asset. Gemini also published tweets, including on May 26, 2021, promoting the high interest rates offered via Gemini Earn, with statements such as the following:

image::media/ch03-genesis-01.png[]

[start=35]
. Gemini itself repeatedly described Gemini Earn as an investment on its website. For example, Gemini included this description in an FAQ entitled, “What are the risks of Gemini Earn?”:
[none]
** Cryptocurrency, like many assets, can be volatile and subject to price swings. There is always a risk in [underline]#investing#, and each customer needs to assess their own risk tolerance before making any [underline]#investment decisions#. Our partners in Gemini Earn have an obligation to return funds according to the terms of their loan agreement. However, Gemini Earn customers (the lenders) always assume some level of risk when they decide to lend their funds. We believe Gemini Earn gives our retail investors another way to stay long-term in the asset class and have the [underline]#option to invest and earn interest#, all on the Gemini platform.
. Gemini’s website also claimed that Gemini Earn investors could “receive more than 100x the average national interest rate, among the highest rates on the market” and that Gemini Earn “offer[s] more flexibility than other yield-generating cryptocurrency investments.”
. Additionally, Gemini’s website featured a calculator that would allow a user to select a deposit amount, crypto asset type, and a time frame to see how much interest could be earned by tendering crypto assets through Gemini Earn. The calculator would reveal the projected amount of interest that could be earned by investing the investor’s crypto assets for a period between one and four years.

[.text-center]
*Genesis’ Deployment of the Invested Gemini Earn Crypto Assets*
[start=38]
. Genesis pooled on its balance sheet the crypto assets that it received from the Gemini Earn investors and other investors, and in practice did not segregate the crypto assets it received from different groups of investors. Genesis retained possession and control over the investors’ crypto assets on its balance sheet, and determined how much to hold, lend out to others, and otherwise use. Genesis exercised its discretion in how to use investors’ crypto assets to generate revenue for its business and to pay the interest rates it promised Gemini Earn investors and other investors. The Gemini Earn Agreement did not contain any explicit terms restricting how investors’ crypto assets would be used by Genesis.
. Generally, Genesis deployed the Gemini Earn investors’ crypto assets by either lending them to Institutional Borrowers or using the assets as collateral for Genesis’ own borrowing. Crypto assets not loaned to Institutional Borrowers or used for collateral were held by Genesis on its balance sheet in an effort to provide Genesis with liquidity to meet potential demand for loans as well as to repay the investors in its crypto asset program, including Gemini Earn. Genesis also had the ability to loan the crypto assets to related parties, including its parent company.
. Genesis employed its discretion and judgment in determining the terms of transactions with Institutional Borrowers. For example, Genesis conducted due diligence on the Institutional Borrowers before entering into a transaction. Genesis negotiated an initial agreement with each Institutional Borrower, and then individually negotiated the terms – including the type of crypto assets to be lent, interest rate, duration of the loan, and collateral (if any) – of every subsequent lending transaction. Genesis separately evaluated each Institutional Borrower, as well as market conditions, when determining collateral rates.
. The returns earned by each Gemini Earn investor were reliant on the pooling of the invested crypto assets and the ways in which Genesis deployed those assets, including Genesis’ evaluation of the Institutional Borrowers, negotiation of favorable terms, and management of market and counterparty risk. When Genesis loaned crypto assets it received through the Gemini Earn program, the assets were transferred to the Institutional Borrowers and left Genesis’ balance sheet. Ultimately, the returns of Gemini Earn investors were dependent on Genesis’ managerial efforts and risk management in its lending activities.
. The interest income that Genesis received from lending crypto assets to Institutional Borrowers was used to generate revenue for Genesis and to pay the promised interest to Gemini Earn investors and other investors. Genesis did not have any other revenue-generating activities. For example, for the three months ended March 31, 2022, Genesis received approximately $169.8 million in interest income from Institutional Borrowers and paid $166.2 million in interest to the investors in its crypto asset program, including Gemini Earn. 
. Genesis also loaned an additional $575 million worth of crypto assets, including those of Gemini Earn investors, to related party DCG, which DCG used to fund investment opportunities and repurchase DCG stock from non-employee shareholders in secondary transactions.

[upperalpha]
. *The Gemini Earn Program Constituted an Offer and Sale of Securities Under Reves*

[start=44]
. Under Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act, the definition of a security includes any “note.” See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77b, 78c. A note is presumed to be a security unless it bears a strong resemblance to instruments that are not securities, which courts determine by examining four factors: (1) the motivation of the parties; (2) the plan of distribution; (3) the expectations of the investing public; and (4) the availability of an alternative regulatory regime that “significantly reduces the risk of the instrument” for investors other than the securities laws, “thereby rendering application of the Securities Acts unnecessary.” See Reves v. Ernst & Young, 494 U.S. 56, 64–69 (1990). Under Reves, the Gemini Earn Agreements were notes and offered and sold through Gemini Earn as securities.

[start=1]
. *The Purpose of the Gemini Earn Program*

[start=45]
. Genesis offered the Gemini Earn program to obtain crypto assets for the use of its business – namely, to run its institutional lending activities, generate profits for itself, and to pay the interest promised to Genesis investors, and investors in Gemini Earn were primarily interested in the profit they expected the program to generate.
. Genesis controlled the crypto assets it obtained from investors and had complete discretion in determining how much to hold, lend and otherwise use. Genesis used the crypto assets it raised from Gemini Earn investors and other investors to make loans to Institutional Borrowers or as collateral for Genesis’ own borrowing. Genesis also had the discretion to hold the assets on its balance sheet to provide Genesis with liquidity to meet potential demand for loans as well as to repay the investors in its crypto asset program.
. In turn, investors participated in the Gemini Earn program primarily for profit, i.e., to receive a return on their crypto assets. Genesis and Gemini both touted the profits investors could earn by investing their crypto assets with Genesis, including by advertising Gemini Earn as an investment and touting that investors could receive up to 8.05% annual percentage yield (“APY”) on their crypto assets. Investors who purchased the Gemini Earn notes were led to expect that by tendering and giving control over their crypto assets to Genesis, they would receive profit in the form of interest on those assets.
. In short, Genesis intended to use the crypto assets for its business and its sole source of revenue, and the Gemini Earn investors were primarily motivated to earn a profit on their crypto assets in the form of interest.

[start=2]
. *The Gemini Earn Program was Offered and Sold to a Broad Segment of the Public*

[start=49]
. Genesis and Gemini publicly advertised the Gemini Earn Agreements, through Gemini Earn, on websites and on social media. Moreover, the Gemini Earn Agreements were offered and sold to any U.S. investor, including retail investors. As of November 16, 2022, there were approximately 340,000 retail investors, the majority of whom resided in the United States, who had crypto assets invested with Genesis through the Gemini Earn program. The Gemini Earn Agreements were offered and sold to a broad segment of the general public.

[start=3]
. *The Investing Public Considered these Notes as Investments*

[start=50]
. Genesis and Gemini, through websites and social media, promoted Gemini Earn as an investment, specifically as a way to earn high “returns” or “yield” on investors’ crypto assets. Gemini repeatedly described Gemini Earn as an investment on its own website and social media and repeatedly touted that the Gemini Earn interest rates were “among the highest rates on the market” and “higher than most existing options.” Gemini’s website further claimed that Gemini Earn investors could “receive more than 100x the national interest rate.” Gemini’s website also included a calculator that showed a user potentially how much interest they could earn by investing their crypto assets in the Gemini Earn program for a period between one and four years. The economic realities of the transaction, in which investors had an opportunity to tender crypto assets with Genesis in exchange for earning interest with some of the “highest rates” available for crypto assets, further underscore why the investing public considered the Gemini Earn program to be an investment opportunity.

[start=4]
. *No Alternative Regulatory Regime or Risk-Reducing Factors Exist to Protect Gemini Earn Investors*

[start=51]
. No alternative regulatory scheme or risk-reducing factors existed to protect investors with respect to the Gemini Earn program. In its own FAQs, Genesis noted that “[D]igital assets are not covered by SIPC insurance” and that “[e]stablishing a lending and borrowing relationship with Genesis is not the same as opening a depository account or a savings account” and that “[a]ccounts with Genesis do not enjoy FDIC protection.” Genesis Global Trading, Inc., the SEC registered broker-dealer affiliated with Genesis, did not have a role in the Gemini Earn program. Although Genesis has registered as a money services business (“MSB”) with FinCEN, the anti-money laundering and recording keeping and reporting requirements of an MSB – designed to prevent money services business from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities – do not provide the significant disclosures and other investor protections afforded by the federal securities laws. 
. Similarly, although Gemini is registered with NYSDFS as a New York limited purpose trust company, NYSDFS did not have oversight over Genesis. Gemini publicly stated that Gemini Earn does not operate like a traditional bank account, is not protected by a governmental program, and is not backed by Gemini itself. In a February 2021 press release launching Gemini Earn, Gemini stated that “Gemini Earn is not a depository account. . . . Loans are not insured by Gemini or any governmental program or institution.” Likewise, on its website, Gemini noted that “Gemini Earn is structured similarly to non-deposit services offered by financial institutions and not insured by FDIC, SIPC, any other governmental program, or Gemini.”
. Any capital reserve requirements applicable to Gemini did not apply to Genesis or to the crypto assets tendered to Genesis through Gemini Earn.
. Under the terms of the Gemini Earn Agreement, Genesis was not required to post collateral. Gemini told investors, “All lending by you through our Program will be on an unsecured basis. We will not collect or hold collateral from Borrowers, nor maintain any collateral account for your benefit.” Although Genesis later provided some collateral to Gemini in August 2022, the collateral Genesis provided to Gemini was in the form of restricted shares that could not be liquidated immediately and amounted to only a fraction of the total investor assets held in Gemini Earn.
. As evidenced by the current state of Gemini Earn, where investors have been unable to access their crypto assets or any form of collateral since November 16, 2022, any oversight of Genesis as an MSB and Gemini as a limited purpose trust company did not adequately reduce the risk of significant harm to Gemini Earn retail investors. 

[upperalpha, start=2]
. *The Gemini Earn Program Constituted the Offer and Sale of Investment Contracts under Howey*

[start=56]
. The offer and sale of Gemini Earn Agreements through the Gemini Earn program also constitutes the offer and sale of investment contracts under Howey.

[start=1]
. *Gemini Earn Involved the Investment of Money*

[start=57]
. The Gemini Earn program involved an investment of money. Between February 2021 and November 2022, Genesis raised billions of dollars from hundreds of thousands of retail investors, who tendered crypto assets to Genesis through the program.

[start=2]
. *Gemini Earn Investors and Defendants Invested in a Common Enterprise*

[start=58]
. Investors in Gemini Earn invested in a common enterprise with other investors and with Defendants.
. Genesis pooled Gemini Earn investors’ and other investors’ crypto assets on Genesis’ balance sheet, and used those assets in order to generate returns for both Genesis and investors, including Gemini Earn investors. Genesis did not manage individual or separate accounts for each investor in Gemini Earn. Instead, the returns earned by each investor were reliant on the pooling of the invested crypto assets. As the invested crypto assets were not segregated in any way by Genesis, each investor’s fortune was tied to the fortunes of the other investors.
. Gemini Earn investors’ fortunes were also tied to Genesis’ fortunes; both Genesis and Gemini Earn investors earned profits when Genesis deployed the pooled assets. Moreover, Genesis’ current situation, where it has experienced withdrawal requests that exceed its current liquidity and has consequently restricted Gemini Earn investors from withdrawing their crypto assets and begun a restructuring process, further demonstrates that the fortunes of Genesis and the fortunes of each Gemini Earn investor are tied to one another in a common enterprise. 

[start=3]
. *Gemini Earn Investors Reasonably Expected to Profit From the Efforts of Defendants*

[start=61]
. Investors in the Gemini Earn program reasonably expected to profit from the efforts of Defendants.
. From its inception, Defendants have explicitly marketed the Gemini Earn program as an investment opportunity which led investors to reasonably expect to profit from their efforts. As detailed above, through their websites and social media channels, both Genesis and Gemini publicly touted the ability for investors to earn yield or returns via Gemini Earn. Gemini repeatedly itself described Gemini Earn as an investment on its own website; repeatedly touted that the Gemini Earn interest rates were “among the highest rates on the market” and that Gemini Earn investors could “receive more than 100x the national interest rate”; and Gemini’s website illustrated how much interest Gemini Earn investors could potentially earn by investing their crypto assets for a period between one and four years.
. Genesis also described itself as the “premier institutional digital asset financial services firm,” and “the world’s largest digital asset lender” and that “[h]olders of digital currencies can earn yield on their assets by lending directly to Genesis, a regulated and trusted counterparty.” Accordingly, Gemini Earn investors were led to expect that Defendants’ efforts to generate the investment returns – i.e., the promised interest – would result in profit for investors.
. As part of the Gemini Earn Agreements, investors ceded control over their crypto assets to Genesis, who has complete discretion in deploying the crypto assets. Genesis, not investors, undertook various complex tasks of pooling Gemini Earn crypto assets, identifying Institutional Borrowers to serve as counterparties, negotiating individual agreements with those counterparties, and managing market and counterparty risk. Investors understood that Genesis would conduct due diligence on Institutional Borrowers and evaluate market conditions in determining the appropriate collateral levels. 
. Moreover, the economic realities of the Gemini Earn program demonstrate that Genesis was motivated to use its experience and skill as the “premier institutional digital asset financial services firm” and its economic power as “the world’s largest digital asset lender ” to select appropriate Institutional Borrowers to serve as counterparties, negotiate for the highest interest rates from those Institutional Borrowers, and set appropriate collateral levels, in order to generate maximum profit for itself. Defendants’ efforts were essential to the success or failure of the enterprise.
. Investors understood that, on a monthly basis, the interest rate for their Gemini Earn investments would be revised by Genesis, reflecting Genesis’ ongoing managerial efforts to pay among “the highest rates in the market.”
. Defendants’ statements and actions, and the economic reality of the Gemini Earn program, have led reasonable investors to expect Genesis to undertake significant and essential technical, managerial, and entrepreneurial efforts on their behalf, and investors in the Gemini Earn program reasonably expected to profit from those efforts.

[upperroman, start=3]
. [underline]#*Defendants Have Failed to Register their Offer and Sale of Securities Through Gemini Earn with the Commission*#

[start=68]
. Defendants offered and sold securities through the Gemini Earn program.
. Defendants have used interstate commerce to offer and sell securities through Gemini Earn by, among other things, engaging in general solicitation through their websites and other promotional materials, including social media.
. Defendants have never had a registration statement filed or in effect with the SEC for their offers and sales of securities through the Gemini Earn program.
. Defendants’ public disclosures contained selective or no information about Genesis’ financial history, audited financial statements, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, and ability to generate profits. Gemini Earn investors also had limited or inadequate information about Genesis’ operations, financial condition, liquidity, or other factors relevant in considering whether to invest in the Gemini Earn program. Investors also lacked full and detailed information regarding how Genesis deploys their crypto assets, including its exposure to volatility in crypto asset markets, the financial condition of Genesis’ counterparties and the amount of collateral Genesis obtained, if any, as part of its loans to Institutional Borrowers. In short, Gemini Earn investors lacked information that issuers provide under the Securities Act when they solicit public investment.

[.text-center]
*[underline]#Summary#*

. In or around June 2020, Nexo Capital Inc. (“Nexo”) began to offer and sell the so-called Nexo Earn Interest Product (“EIP”) in the United States. The EIP allowed United States investors to tender to Nexo certain crypto assets, which Nexo deposited in interest- yielding accounts and then used in various ways to generate income for its own business and to fund interest payments to EIP investors. These included staking, lending, and engaging in arbitrage on purportedly “decentralized” finance platforms; investing in certain crypto assets; loaning funds to retail and institutional borrowers; and entering into options and swap contracts with respect to the crypto assets tendered. As of March 2022, Nexo’s EIP had approximately 112,000 U.S. investors and $2.7 billion in assets from U.S. investors.
. Based on the facts and circumstances set forth below, Nexo offered and sold securities in the form of investment contracts and notes. Nexo offered and sold the EIP to a broad segment of the general public to obtain crypto assets for general use in its business. Nexo obtained the crypto assets in exchange for a promise to pay them back, with interest. Investors in the EIP had a reasonable expectation of obtaining a future profit from Nexo’s efforts in managing the EIP, including based on Nexo’s statements about how the EIP was a tool investors could use to generate wealth. Investors also had a reasonable expectation that Nexo would use the invested crypto assets in Nexo’s lending and principal investing activity, and that investors would share profits in the form of interest payments in direct proportion to their investments, as a result of Nexo’s managerial and entrepreneurial efforts. Notably, Nexo promoted the EIP as an investment, by which investors could earn a consistent return. Nexo took complete control over investors’ assets from the EIP, pooled them together, including with Nexo’s other assets, and then deployed those assets in various revenue- generating activities. Additionally, Nexo’s lending and investment activities were at its own discretion, and Nexo was responsible for managing the risks involved.
. Nexo offered and sold securities without a registration statement filed or in effect with the Commission and without qualifying for an exemption from registration. As a result, Nexo violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.

[.text-center]
*[underline]#Respondent#*

[start=4]
. Nexo Capital Inc. (“Nexo”) is a Cayman Islands corporation formed in 2018 with its principal place of business in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands. Nexo provides crypto asset-related financial products and services, including purchasing, lending, borrowing, trading, and storing. Nexo is part of the Nexo Group, which is comprised of other Nexo entities that are primarily incorporated in various European countries.

[.text-center]
*[underline]#Facts#*

[start=5]
. Since 2018, Nexo has conducted a crypto asset business globally and in the United States through Nexo’s public website http://www.nexo.io and through a mobile application, both of which were accessible at all relevant times from within the United States. The business has included crypto asset-related financial products and services, including the EIP (discussed further below); the “Borrow Product,” by which customers could borrow crypto assets; the “Nexo Exchange,” through which customers could trade certain crypto assets; and storage for crypto assets. As of March 2022, Nexo had 3.7 million global users and $13.7 billion in global assets across its entire platform for the various services it offered.
. In or around June 2020, Nexo began to offer and sell the EIP in the United States. To invest in the EIP, investors provided crypto assets to Nexo in exchange for Nexo’s promise to provide a variable interest payment. Per its description to investors, Nexo determined the interest rate based upon, among other things, the specific crypto asset provided to Nexo by the investor and the duration of time the investor committed to maintaining the asset with Nexo. The longer the time period, the higher the interest rate. Investors began accruing interest 24 hours after tendering eligible crypto assets, with interest calculated daily and compounded for interest earned in-kind.
. Nexo offered the EIP under flexible and fixed terms. Under flexible terms, there was no holding period and investors could withdraw their crypto assets and earned interest at any time. Under fixed terms, investors were unable to withdraw their crypto assets and interest for the duration of the defined term. Interest accrued in connection with the EIP was credited to investors’ accounts at the expiration of the fixed term, if applicable, or otherwise daily. Investors were able to withdraw all or part of the crypto assets they invested with Nexo, including the interest earned, by instructing Nexo to transfer the crypto assets to the investor’s personal “digital wallet” (generally, a unique address within a cryptographically-secured ledger used to “hold” crypto assets) or by instructing Nexo to sell the relevant crypto assets in exchange for fiat currency such as U.S. Dollars, and then transferring the U.S. Dollar proceeds to a selected bank account.
. The investor assets tendered through the EIP were for Nexo’s general use in its business, namely in lending and investment activities, which generated income for Nexo and its investors. Nexo pooled the loaned assets from the EIP together with other Nexo assets and exercised full discretion over how to use the pooled assets. Nexo retained possession and control over the tendered crypto assets.
. The Terms and Conditions for the EIP provided the following:
[none]
.. [Investors] understand and agree that we might convert, pledge, re-pledge, hypothecate, rehypothecate, sell, lend, or otherwise transfer, dispose of or use any amount of any Digital Assets in regard to which you use the Nexo Earn Interest Product, separately or together with other property, and for any period of time, and without retaining in our possession and/or control for delivery a like amount thereof or any other assets, at our sole and absolute discretion. Any such action will be performed in our name only and you will have no benefits and liabilities from it.
. Nexo pooled the assets tendered through the EIP with other assets, and used the asset pool to engage in various revenue-generating activities, including staking, lending, arbitrage, and earning interest on certain purportedly “decentralized” finance platforms by providing liquidity; investing in certain crypto assets; offering crypto credit lines (i.e., loans to retail and institutional borrowers); and entering into options and swap contracts. Nexo relied on the revenue generated from the foregoing activities to fund interest payments to EIP investors and to generate income and profits for Nexo itself.
. Nexo marketed the EIP to U.S. investors through general solicitations on its website, the Nexo mobile application, and on social media and elsewhere online, including on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Nexo promoted the EIP as an investment and profit-making opportunity. For example, Nexo advertised the attractive interest rates offered through the EIP as a way to “grow your wealth.” It highlighted on its website that investors could earn “up to 12% annual interest.” Nexo also promoted the EIP as an investment opportunity on Twitter. For example, in a March 30, 2021 tweet, titled “Why Nexo #1: HODLing [sic]+ Growing Your Investments,” Nexo linked to additional information on its website to “Learn how to earn compounding interest on your Crypto and Fiat assets using Nexo’s Savings Account.” xref:sec_nexo_footnote_1[^*(1)*^]
. At no point has Nexo or any other entity in the Nexo Group filed a registration statement with the Commission for the offer and sale of the EIP. Nor did the offer and sale of the EIP qualify for an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. The only registrations that Nexo Group entities have with U.S.-based regulators are money transmitter licenses and certain state-level consumer or lender licenses.
. Under the EIP Terms and Conditions “Risk Disclosure” section, which is available on Nexo’s website, Nexo explained that “Digital Assets are not money or legal tender, are not backed by the government or by a central bank and mostly do not have any underlying assets, revenue stream, or another source of value.” Another provision under the Risk Disclosure section provides:
[none]
.. You understand and agree that you use the Nexo Account and the Nexo Earn Interest Product at your own risk. This section is not exhaustive and does not disclose all the risks associated with the Digital Assets and the use of the Nexo Earn Interest Product and any of the related Nexo Wallet Services. You shall, therefore, carefully
consider whether such use is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources.
. On February 18, 2022, after the Commission announced charges with respect to a crypto investment product similar to the EIP, see BlockFi Lending LLC, Exch. Act Rel. No. 11029 (Feb. 14, 2022), Nexo voluntarily ceased offering and selling the EIP to new U.S. investors. After February 18, 2022, existing U.S. investors continued to earn interest (at varying rates) on assets held in EIP accounts as of that date, but assets added after that date would not earn interest. In early March 2022, just as Nexo put in place these restrictions for U.S. investors, there were approximately 440,000 global investors in the EIP and 112,000 investors in the U.S. As of March 2022, the value of EIP assets was approximately $9 billion globally and $2.7 billion in the U.S.
. On December 5, 2022, Nexo proactively announced that it was terminating the EIP in certain states and “phasing out” all of its products and services in the United States, including permanently ceasing to offer and sell the EIP to U.S. investors, and winding down the EIP for existing U.S. investors who continued to earn interest on funds held in the EIP prior to February 18, 2022.

*[underline]#Legal Analysis#*

[start=16]
. The Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) were designed to “eliminate serious abuses in a largely unregulated securities market.” United Housing Found., Inc. v. Forman, 421 U.S. 837, 849 (1975). They are focused, among other things, “on the capital market of the enterprise system: the sale of securities to raise capital for profit-making purposes . . . and the need for regulation to prevent fraud and to protect the interest of investors.” Id. Under Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act, a security includes any “note.” See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77b. A note is presumed to be a security unless it bears a strong resemblance, to instruments that are not securities, which courts determine by examining four factors: (1) the motivation of the parties; (2) the plan of distribution; (3) the expectations of the investing public; and (4) a risk-reducing factor such as the availability of an alternative regulatory regime that “significantly reduces the risk of the instrument, thereby rendering application of the Securities Acts unnecessary.” See Reves, 494 U.S. at 64–66.
. Applying the Reves four-part analysis, the EIPs were securities. First, Nexo offered and sold the EIP to obtain crypto assets for the general use of its business, namely to run its lending and investment activities to pay interest to EIP investors, and purchasers invested in the EIP to receive interest on the loaned crypto assets. Second, the EIP was offered and sold to a broad segment of the general public. Third, Nexo promoted the EIP as an investment, specifically as a way to earn a consistent return on crypto assets. Fourth, no alternative regulatory scheme or other risk-reducing factors exist with respect to the EIP.
. Under Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act, a security includes “an investment contract.” See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77b. Based on the facts set forth above, the EIP also constitutes the offer and sale of investment contracts. See Howey, 328 U.S. at 301. Investors in the EIP tendered money to Nexo, in the form of crypto assets, to participate in the EIP. Nexo then pooled the EIP investors’ crypto assets and used those assets for lending and investment activities that would generate returns for both Nexo and EIP investors. The returns earned by each EIP investor were a function of the pooling of the loaned crypto assets, and the ways in which Nexo deployed those loaned assets. In this way, each investor’s fortune was tied to the fortunes of the other investors. In addition, because Nexo earned revenue for itself through its deployment of the loaned assets, the EIP investors’ fortunes were also linked to those of Nexo. Moreover, EIP investors’ return were based on interest rates and proportional to their investments in EIP. Through its public statements, Nexo created a reasonable expectation that EIP investors would earn profits derived from Nexo’s efforts to manage the loaned crypto assets profitably enough to pay the stated interest rates to the investors. Nexo retained ownership and control over the borrowed crypto assets, and determined how much to hold, lend, and invest. Nexo’s lending and investment activities were at its own discretion, and Nexo managed the risks involved.
. Nexo did not file a registration statement with the Commission for the offers and sales of EIP, nor did its offers and sales of the EIP qualify for an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. 
. As a result of the conduct described above, Nexo violated Section 5(a) of the Securities Act, which prohibits, unless a registration statement is in effect as to a security, any person, directly or indirectly, from making use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to sell such security through the use or medium of any prospectus or otherwise; or to carry or cause to be carried through the mails or in interstate commerce, by any means or instruments of transportation, any such security for the purpose of sale or for delivery after sale.
. As a result of the conduct described above, Nexo also violated Section 5(c) of the Securities Act, which prohibits any person, directly or indirectly, from making use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to offer to sell or offer to buy through the use or medium of any prospectus or otherwise any security, unless a registration statement has been filed as to such security.

*[underline]#Respondent’s Cooperation and Remedial Efforts#*

[start=22]
. As explained above, on February 18, 2022, after the Commission announced charges involving a similar crypto investment product, Nexo voluntarily ceased offering the EIP to new U.S. investors and ceased paying interest on new funds added to existing EIP accounts of U.S. investors. On December 5, 2022, Nexo proactively announced that it was ceasing the EIP in certain states and phasing out all of its products and services in the United States, including permanently ceasing to offer the EIP to all U.S. investors.
. Nexo will cease the EIP as to all U.S. investors by April 1, 2023 and will exit the U.S. entirely shortly thereafter.
. Nexo will maintain the interest rate that is in place as of the date of the entry of this Order on existing U.S. EIP accounts for the duration of the period of time that Nexo takes to phase out all of its products and services in the United States.
. In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Respondent and cooperation afforded the Commission staff.

*COMPLAINT AND DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL*
|===
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC” or “Commission”), for its Complaint against Defendants Payward Ventures, Inc. d/b/a Kraken and Payward Trading, Ltd. d/b/a Kraken (collectively “Defendants” or “Kraken”), alleges as follows: 

[.text-center]
[underline]#*SUMMARY*#

. This case concerns the illegal unregistered offer and sale of securities involving the staking of crypto assets.xref:sec_payward_footnote_1[^*(1)*^] In particular, Defendants have offered and sold an investment contract to the general public, including United States investors, whereby investors transfer certain crypto assets to Kraken for “staking” in exchange for advertised annual investment returns of as much as 21% (the “Kraken Staking Program” or “Program”).
. “Staking” concerns the “proof of stake” validation protocols that certain blockchains utilize. These protocols offer rewards to those who “validate”—or confirm—transactions on the blockchain. To become a validator and obtain such rewards, holders of crypto assets must first “stake”—or commit—crypto assets (typically, the “native” crypto asset on a particular blockchain such as Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), and Cosmos (ATOM)). Validators are selected based on the size of their stake, among other factors, creating an incentive to stake, or commit, greater quantities of crypto assets. The protocols incentivize validators to add legitimate transactions to the blockchain because validators are rewarded if they do and could be penalized if they do not, including by having the staked crypto assets “slashed” (or destroyed).
. The Kraken Staking Program is an investment program created by Defendants that aggregates investors’ crypto assets to enable Kraken to stake these pooled investor assets and achieve a competitive advantage in the staking marketplace. Through this pooling of crypto assets and Defendants’ efforts, the Kraken Staking Program purports to offer investors benefits that are not available to investors who stake on their own. Among other things, Defendants advertise regular investment returns and payouts, no staking minimums, their technical expertise in staking, and an easy-to-use platform created by Defendants. In addition, Defendants offer investors instant rewards accrual and the ability instantly to
unstake (essentially, to take back the assets immediately).
. Defendants market the Kraken Staking Program by touting specified investment returns for certain staking-eligible crypto assets on the kraken.com website, on social media channels, and through advertisement emails. Defendants determine these returns, not the underlying blockchain protocols, and the returns are not necessarily dependent on the actual returns that Kraken receives from staking. If interested in obtaining these returns, investors can transfer eligible crypto assets to the Program, including by first purchasing the tokens from Kraken’s trading platform for the market price of the token plus a fee or transferring the eligible crypto assets obtained elsewhere to Kraken. Defendants pool these tokens, designating some for staking and some purportedly as a liquidity reserve. Investors lose possession and control over their crypto assets when they transfer those assets to Defendants and accordingly take on risks associated with the Kraken platform.
. Pooling and retaining control over the tokens potentially reduces Defendants’ transaction costs and risks and, in the case of tokens actually staked by Defendants to proof of stake protocols, increases the likelihood that Defendants will be selected to validate blockchain transactions and therefore earn rewards, and provides smoother, more reliable rewards. Defendants advertise that their significant efforts, discussed in more detail below, provide investors with constant and regular returns (called “rewards”), more so than investors could achieve if they tried to implement a staking strategy on their own without the benefit of Defendants’ scale and expertise.
. By April 2022, U.S. investors had over $2.7 billion worth of crypto assets invested in the Kraken Staking Program. Kraken has earned approximately $147 million in net revenue from the Program since its commencement, and a substantial portion of this net revenue—more than $45 million—is attributable to crypto assets obtained from U.S. investors. By June 2022, more than 135,000 unique U.S.-based usernames had transferred crypto assets to participate in the Kraken Staking Program.
. Through the Kraken Staking Program, Defendants have offered and sold investment contracts without registering the offer or sales with the SEC as required by the federal securities laws, and no exemption from the registration requirement applied. The absence of any registration statement means that investors have lacked material information about the Kraken Staking Program. Missing material information includes, but is not limited to, the business and financial condition of Defendants, the fees charged by Defendants, the extent of Defendants’ profits, and specific and detailed risks of the investment, including how Defendants determine to stake investor tokens or purportedly hold them in reserve and the extent of these purported liquidity reserves, or whether tokens are put to some other use. Investors have had no insight into Defendants’ financial condition and whether Defendants have the means of paying the marketed returns—and indeed, per the Kraken Terms of Service, Defendants retain the right not to pay any investor return. Defendants have disclosed only the information that they wish, not the information required by law. 
. Defendants continue to offer and sell the Kraken Staking Program without any registration statement, meaning that, until the illegal offering is enjoined, investors will continue to bear the substantial risk resulting from Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws. 

[.text-center]
[underline]#*VIOLATIONS*#

[start=9]
. By engaging in the conduct set forth in this Complaint, Defendants engaged in and are currently engaging in the unlawful offer and sale of securities in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and 77e(c)].
. Unless Defendants are permanently restrained and enjoined, they will continue to engage in the acts, practices, and courses of business set forth in this Complaint and in acts, practices, and courses of business of similar type and object.

[.text-center]
[underline]#*NATURE OF THE PROCEEDING AND RELIEF SOUGHT*#

[start=11]
. The Commission brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by Section 20 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t].
. The Commission seeks a final judgment: (a) permanently enjoining Defendants from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act; (b) permanently enjoining Defendants and any entity controlled by them from, directly or indirectly, offering or selling securities through crypto asset staking services or staking programs; (c) ordering Defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains and to pay prejudgment interest thereon pursuant to Section 21(d)(3), (5) and (7) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(3), (5) and (7)]; and (d) imposing civil money penalties on Defendants pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C § 77t(d)]. 

[.text-center]
[underline]#*JURISDICTION AND VENUE*#

[start=13]
. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)]. Defendants, directly or indirectly, have made use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged herein.
. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)]. Defendants marketed and offered the Kraken Staking Program to residents of this District, including through the kraken.com website and social media, and, according to a filing made with the California Secretary of State, Defendant Payward
Ventures, Inc. has its principal address in this District. 

[.text-center]
[underline]#*INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT*#

[start=15]
. Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 3-2(d), the case properly is assigned to the San Francisco Division because, according to records filed with the California Secretary of State, Defendant Payward Ventures, Inc. has its principal address in San Francisco, California, and a substantial part of the events and omissions giving rise to the violations occurred in San Francisco County.

[.text-center]
[underline]#*DEFENDANTS*#

[start=16]
. *Payward Ventures, Inc., d/b/a Kraken (“Ventures”),* is a Delaware corporation, and, according to records filed with the California Secretary of State, has a principal address of 237 Kearny St., #102, San Francisco, California, 94108. Ventures operates Kraken’s online crypto asset trading platform. From its inception until October 2021, Ventures also offered and managed the Kraken Staking Program to U.S. investors, per the Kraken Terms of Service. Since the Staking Program’s inception, Ventures has maintained the wallets and private keys associated with the Kraken Staking Program.
. *Payward Trading, Ltd. d/b/a Kraken (“Trading”)* is a corporation registered in the British Virgin Islands. Trading has offered and managed the Kraken Staking Program to U.S. investors since October 2021, per the Kraken Terms of Service. Trading is a  wholly-owned subsidiary of Seven Cities Pte Ltd., a corporation registered in Singapore;
Seven Cities Pte Ltd., in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Payward, Inc., which is also the parent company of Ventures.

[underline]#*RELATED ENTITY*#

[start=18]
. Payward, Inc. (“Payward”) is a Delaware corporation, and, according to records filed with the California Secretary of State, has a principal address of 237 Kearny St., #102, San Francisco, California 94108. Payward is the corporate parent of Ventures and Trading.

[.text-center]
[underline]#*STATUTORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK*#

[start=19]
. The Securities Act sets forth a regime of full and fair disclosure, in contrast to traditional commercial principles of caveat emptor. Congress mandated that persons who offer and sell securities to the investing public provide sufficient, accurate information to allow investors to make informed decisions before they invest.
. The definition of a “security” under the Securities Act includes a wide range of investment vehicles, including “investment contracts.” Investment contracts are instruments through which a person invests money in a common enterprise and reasonably expects profits or returns derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 299 (1946). Courts have found that novel or unique investment vehicles constitute investment contracts, including interests in orange groves, animal breeding programs, railroads, mobile phones, and enterprises that exist only on the Internet, including crypto assets.
. Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act require that issuers of securities register the offer or sale of securities with the SEC, unless an exemption applies. Similarly, those provisions prohibit engaging in the unregistered offer and sale of such securities. Registration statements relating to the offer and sale of securities provide public investors with material information about the issuer and the offering, including financial and managerial information, how the issuer will use offering proceeds, and the risks and trends that affect the enterprise and an investment in its securities. 

[.text-center]
[underline]#*BACKGROUND ON CRYPTO ASSETS AND STAKING*#

[start=22]
. The term “crypto asset” generally refers to an asset issued and/or transferred using distributed ledger or blockchain technology, including assets sometimes referred to as “cryptocurrencies,” digital “coins,” and digital “tokens.”
. A blockchain or distributed ledger is a peer-to-peer database spread across a network of computers that records all transactions in theoretically unchangeable, digitallyrecorded data packages. The system relies on cryptographic techniques for secure recording of transactions.
. People can own crypto assets and hold them at a blockchain address under their control. Typically, someone controls an address—and the crypto assets held at that address—with a private cryptographic key for that address. Anyone with that private key can sign and submit a transaction to the blockchain that will transfer the crypto assets at that address to another address. Typically, in a single blockchain address, people can hold multiple types of crypto assets.
. Individuals often control multiple blockchain addresses and store their private keys for those addresses in software called a “wallet.” A “wallet” allows them to manage their crypto assets and key information and to communicate with a blockchain. People also can own crypto assets by opening an account on a trading platform (like the Kraken trading platform) and then transferring their crypto assets from their own blockchain address to an address controlled by the trading platform.
. Crypto assets may be traded on crypto asset trading platforms in exchange for other crypto assets or fiat currency (legal tender issued by a country), at times by being allocated to investors’ accounts in the records of the platform (i.e., “off-chain”), without necessarily being transferred from one blockchain address to another (i.e., “on-chain”).
Crypto asset trading platforms typically receive a fee for facilitating such trades. 
. Blockchains typically employ a consensus mechanism to “validate” crypto asset transactions. A consensus mechanism describes the particular protocol used by a blockchain to agree on which transactions are valid, to update the blockchain, and to compensate certain participants with additional crypto assets. There can be multiple sources
for the compensation, including from fees charged to those transacting on the blockchain or from new crypto assets created or “mined” by the validation of transactions, under the terms of the blockchain protocol. Compensation in the form of newly issued crypto assets may dilute the value of the existing tokens.
. Validators who participate in confirming transactions on blockchains may collect fees to participate in the validation of transactions.
. The consensus mechanism typically is a set of rules followed by the validator nodes, or computers on a blockchain’s network running the blockchain protocol that are able to validate transactions. “Proof of work” and “proof of stake” describe the two major “consensus mechanisms” used by blockchains.
. Proof of work, such as in the protocol used by the Bitcoin blockchain, involves computers, or validator nodes, attempting to “mine” a “block” of transactions, in part, by guessing a pre-determined number. The first miner to successfully guess this number earns the right to update the blockchain and to be rewarded with crypto assets. This mining process typically requires a large amount of computing power and energy.
. Proof of stake, used by blockchains such as the Cardano (ADA), Ethereum (ETH), Polkadot (DOT), and Cosmos (ATOM) blockchains, involves the protocol selecting from crypto asset holders who have committed or “staked” a minimum number of tokens to validate transactions. Typically, users can stake their own crypto assets, or they can delegate their crypto assets to a particular node for that node to use them in staking. Nodes often act as “staking pools” when others designate their crypto assets to that node for staking of their tokens. A person or entity operating a node is called a “node operator.”
. In general, the greater portion of crypto assets staked by an individual or group relative to all the staked tokens, the more likely that holder is to be selected as a validator and earn the ability to receive the staking rewards. Thus, the most successful staking operations are those that maximize the chances of being selected by the protocol, and thus being rewarded with more crypto assets—typically by staking a large number of tokens and minimizing server downtime. In addition, for some crypto assets, the probability of being selected as validator increases when a node operator delegates its own tokens for staking alongside its customers.
. Typically, crypto assets are unavailable for trading or other purposes when staked, while protocols will automatically distribute a portion of the crypto asset rewards to the successful node operator. To encourage more nodes to participate in validation, protocols typically cap rewards once the nodes reach a certain size. As the cap is approached, node operators can start an additional node.
. The “staking” of crypto assets is meant to incentivize good faith and honest validation of transactions, as staked tokens may be “slashed” (or destroyed), and no rewards will be paid, if transactions are not validated appropriately. Typically, the protocol rewards the selected validator with additional crypto assets only if the validator successfully and correctly validates a new block on the chain.
. Another component of certain proof of stake protocols is known as the “bonding”/“unbonding” period. The bonding period is a length of time set by the protocol for a crypto asset to be staked by a validator in order to begin earning rewards. The unbonding period is a length of time set by the protocol to release staked crypto assets back to the validator. In certain cases, a bonding period may mean that it can take weeks before a crypto asset validator can begin earning rewards. The unbonding period can mean it can take weeks for a crypto asset validator to unbond tokens (release them from staking) and potentially do something else with them, such as trade them for other crypto assets or exchange them for fiat. During the time the crypto assets are bonded, the crypto asset owners are unable to transact in them, for example, to react to market price fluctuations of the tokens. 
. Certain protocols charge crypto asset validators fees to stake and unstake tokens, require an upfront refundable deposit in addition to the tokens staked, and/or require the delegation of a minimum amount of tokens to participate in staking.

[upperroman]
. THE KRAKEN STAKING PROGRAM

[start=37]
. In December 2019, Kraken launched its Staking Program as a means to participate in, and profit from, the “proof of stake” consensus mechanism of certain blockchains, by obtaining investors’ crypto assets, pooling those assets, and then staking some portion of those assets in order to obtain rewards, a portion of which Kraken distributes to the investors and a portion of which Kraken retains.
. Kraken advertises that the Program offers investors worldwide, including most U.S. investors, an investment opportunity to participate in proof of stake consensus and receive benefits that may not be available to those investors if they staked on their own. For example, Defendants’ Program offers to investors no staking minimums, no upfront fees or deposits, purported industry-leading cybersecurity protections, a simplified and easy-to-use one-stop-shop trading platform, and the ability, through Kraken’s efforts, to obtain returns based on Kraken’s participation in proof of stake activities for different types of tokens. In addition, for most of the Kraken Staking Program’s staking-eligible crypto assets, the Program also offers investors instant reward accrual, the ability to instantly “unstake” (i.e., to demand the immediate return of crypto assets and not have to comply with unbonding periods that would apply if the investor participated directly), automatic weekly or twice-weekly payout dates, and custom and steady returns with promised minimum returns.

[upperalpha]
. [underline]#*Defendants’ Efforts Result In Unique Benefits To Investors In The Kraken Staking Program*#

[start=39]
. The Kraken Staking Program has several features that differentiate it from staking and earning rewards on your own.

[.text-center]
[underline]#*Passive Investment Opportunity*#

[start=40]
. The Kraken Staking Program is a passive investment opportunity. To participate, investors need only establish an account at kraken.com and purchase stakingeligible tokens from the kraken.com trading platform (for a fee), or transfer their existing staking-eligible tokens to a kraken.com account. Investors then sign-up for the Kraken Staking Program and transfer their crypto assets to the possession and control of Defendants.xref:sec_payward_footnote_2[^*(2)*^]
. Defendants then perform all of the efforts necessary and expected by the investors to obtain the advertised and promised investment return. These efforts include:
** Determining how many tokens to actually stake (see infra, ¶¶ 51-54);
** Determining how many tokens to reserve in order to provide “instant unstaking” and liquidity for investors (see infra, ¶¶ 49-52);
** Staking investor tokens, operating the nodes, and validating blockchain transactions in order to obtain rewards;
** Determining the pro rata investor return (see infra, ¶¶ 44-48);
** Distributing those investor returns;
** Providing a user-friendly, one-stop-shop investor interface (see infra, ¶ 58); and
** Taking further steps as detailed below.

[.text-center]
[underline]#*Pooling of Crypto Assets*#

[start=42]
. Defendants control and pool crypto assets invested in the Kraken Staking Program together with their own proprietary tokens in wallets controlled by Defendants. They then determine when and how many of these pooled tokens to stake in the underlying protocol.
. The pooling of tokens, and the correspondingly larger number of tokens to be staked in the proof of stake protocols, increases the probability that the blockchain protocol will select Defendants to validate transactions and earn rewards and provides smoother, more reliable rewards. According to a Kraken Blog Post dated December 8, 2020: “As staking via Kraken pools client tokens together, it improves the chances that they will be selected to verify transactions, thereby increasing potential payouts.” 

[.text-center]
[underline]#*Kraken-Determined Investment Returns*#

[start=44]
. The returns that investors receive from the Kraken Staking Program differ from the returns that an investor could expect if the investor staked directly (assuming the investor even had the technological capability and sufficient tokens to stake and obtain rewards). Investors in the Kraken Staking Program receive a reward determined by Defendants, not the reward determined by the underlying blockchain protocol.
. In general, staking services can offer set or discretionary reward amounts. Here, Defendants retain the discretion to determine the reward amounts while marketing specific returns (e.g., 4-7% for Ethereum, 9-12% for Polkadot, and 12-15% for Cosmos). In other words, Defendants reserve the right not to pay this advertised return—or indeed any reward. The Kraken Terms of Service states that the marketed return is “an estimate only and not guaranteed” and “may change at any time in Payward Trading’s sole discretion.”xref:sec_payward_footnote_3[^*(3)*^] 
. The marketed return does not account for all staking rewards. Defendants retain for themselves those rewards that exceed the marketed range and do not generally disclose to investors the amount of rewards Defendants retain for themselves. In other words, Defendants do not disclose sufficient information for investors to determine if they are receiving their fair share of the staking rewards. 
. While information about fees, margin, and node success rates are generally available via the underlying protocol itself (or from third-parties), Defendants do not disclose their fees or operating costs for the Kraken Staking Program. Defendants tell investors that their “fee can vary based on the rewards that we earn on behalf of our clients each month. The important point to remember is that our fixed rewards are net of any fees that we charge.” 

[.text-center]
[underline]#*Frequent, Regular Payouts*#

[start=48]
. Defendants also promise regular investment payouts for most staked tokens—typically weekly or twice per week—that deviate from the way rewards are distributed by the underlying staking protocol. In this regard, Defendants advertise that they have “taken the initiative to smooth this revenue stream for our clients by enabling predictable pay-outs as part of our staking services.” For example, regarding staking for certain crypto assets, Kraken’s blog states, “Payouts happen twice a week – every Monday and Thursday at 14:00 UTC […] among the fastest in the industry.”

[.text-center]
[underline]#*Liquidity and Immediate Rewards*#

[start=49]
. Defendants emphasize that investors in the Kraken Staking Program, with limited exceptions, are not subject to bonding and unbonding periods as they would be if they staked these crypto assets directly with most underlying staking protocols. In other words, unlike staking-on-your-own, investors in the Kraken Staking Program are promised enhanced liquidity and immediate rewards. A 2020 Kraken blog post states: “Unlike other staking services, you start earning rewards within minutes of staking your funds,” highlighting an investor’s “flexibility to instantly unstake and trade your funds [on Kraken’s trading platform].” Kraken’s website provides:
[none]
.. Unlike other staking services, at Kraken there is no minimum On-chain staking time needed to earn rewards. You start earning pro-rated rewards for On-chain staking as soon as your instructions to stake are processed by Kraken (which may be within minutes of you staking your funds). +
&nbsp; +
For example, if you utilized On-chain staking for a few hours and then un-staked your funds, you would still be credited prorated rewards on the next payout day. In contrast, on other services you would not receive anything. Unlike other staking services we also have no bonding and unbonding period for Onchain staking (other than ETH2). 
. In effect, Defendants are advertising that they will pay rewards to investors during the period between when the investor transfers his or her assets to the Kraken Staking Program and when the investor demands to receive his or her crypto assets back from the Program. Defendants promise that the Staking Program will begin paying rewards (returns) when investors transfer their crypto assets to the Program, regardless of a blockchain protocol’s bonding period, and promise immediately to return investors’ crypto assets even if the tokens used by Defendants and staked with a protocol actually remain locked and unavailable for the unbonding period.

[.text-center]
[underline]#*Not All Tokens Staked*#

[start=51]
. Defendants claim that they are able to offer instant liquidity (regardless of the unbonding period) because the pooled tokens are fungible and, according to them, Defendants do not actually stake every investor token transferred to them. For many of these crypto assets, Defendants state that they hold back a subset of tokens as a “liquidity reserve.”
. However, Defendants do not disclose the extent of these “unstaked” tokens and how they are used. Investors accordingly have no way of analyzing whether Kraken actually can meet all requests for instant liquidity through these reserves or otherwise. In other words, given the limited disclosure regarding the Kraken Staking Program, Defendants do not provide sufficient information to demonstrate that they, at all times, maintain a token reserve that is adequate to honor the Program’s “no unbonding period” and “instant unstaking” representations should multiple investors with large staking positions seek to redeem those positions at the same time.
. Defendants are under no obligation to segregate the crypto assets that investors transfer to them in exchange for the advertised return (marketed as being from proof of stake activities). Defendants can account for these transfers by rebalancing their internal ledger. 
. Moreover, Defendants do not disclose the extent to which Defendants commingle “unstaked” tokens with Defendants’ other assets or business endeavors. Nor do Defendants disclose the true source of the returns paid to investors to the extent rewards are paid with respect to “unstaked” tokens. 

[.text-center]
[underline]#*Not Directly Subject To Transaction And Deposit Fees, Or Minimum Staking Thresholds*#

[start=55]
. Certain underlying staking protocols impose upfront transaction fees for staking and unstaking, as well as require a refundable deposit above the amount of staked tokens.
. Investors in the Kraken Staking Program are not directly subject to these fees as they do not actually participate in the staking protocols directly, and no initial deposits are required. However, the amount of return that investors receive may be reduced by Defendants based on these and other fees and expenses. Defendants are not required to verify the amount of rewards received, nor verify the amount of any fees charged to Defendants when participating in the staking protocols, or otherwise.
. In addition, staking protocols generally require a certain threshold number of tokens to be able to participate in staking. The Kraken Staking Program does not require that investors commit any minimum threshold of tokens to participate in the Program.

[.text-center]
[underline]#*Purportedly Safe, Easy-To-Use Platform*#

[start=58]
. Kraken offers a simplified user interface. Kraken’s blog states: “Token holders have previously had little choice other than to stake tokens themselves, something that requires technical understanding.” The FAQs state: “Couldn’t I Stake Myself for Free? While you are certainly able to stake yourself, that process can be complex[.]” Another blog entry states: “Instead of needing to purchase special equipment to compete for newly minted network tokens, users are instead able to stake their funds in Kraken’s stake pool.”
. Kraken also advertises the supposed security of the platform. It touts that its “team of experts have built in a number of sophisticated measures to prevent theft of funds, NFTs or information. Theft isn’t the only threat of course. As a professional exchange we offer financial stability, with full reserves, healthy banking relationships and the highest standards of legal compliance.” 
. Kraken further states that it has “assembled a global team of top security professionals who take a risk-based approach to ensuring our clients’ assets are protected at the highest levels while maintaining exceptional performance and an unparalleled client experience. Our team has decades of experience building security programs for the world’s top brands, investigating the largest consumer data breaches, developing security technology trusted by millions of businesses and discovering vulnerabilities in the technology used by billions of people every day.”
. Defendants also tout that they are trustworthy. A November 10, 2022 blog post on Kraken.com titled, “How Kraken Continues to Lead the way in Transparency and Trust” states, in part:
[none]
..[W]e are proud to say that Kraken has long taken the lead when it comes to transparency. In fact, we pioneered the use of regular asset audits in 2014 and hired [an accounting firm] to produce two Proof of Reserve audits over the past year alone. These cryptographic audits are more precise and immutable than any other form of financial statement
and we are one of the first exchanges to perform them regularly. +
Proof of Reserve audits cryptographically prove that we hold the assets we say we hold on your behalf. While this process is almost impossible for traditional financial institutions to conduct, the open and transparent properties of cryptocurrencies enable us to produce these precise audits regularly.xref:sec_payward_footnote_4[^*(4)*^]
. A November 18, 2022 blog post on Kraken.com similarly states: “Kraken offers a comprehensive approach to Proof of Reserves that verifies not just reserves, but also liabilities. Cryptographically proving that we hold our clients’ covered assets in reserve at the time of an audit is only half the battle. Kraken’s Proof of Reserves also includes covered liabilities (i.e., tokens in client accounts).” However, Defendants also describe the limitations of the purported audit, including that it “cannot identify any hidden encumbrances or prove that funds had not been borrowed for purposes of passing the audit.” In other words, the “proof of reserves” audit is akin to a balance sheet that lists assets but not every liability; proof of reserves may not offer investor protection in this scenario.

[upperalpha,start=2]
. [underline]#*Defendants Market The Kraken Staking Program As An Investment Opportunity*#

[start=63]
. Defendants tout the Kraken Staking Program as an investment opportunity on the kraken.com website, in social media, and in mass emails to existing customers.
. For example, Defendants market the possibility of profits through an expected rate of investment return. The kraken.com website, imaged below, states that investors can “*Earn up to 21%* yearly on your crypto”: 

image::media/ch03-payward-01.png[]

[start=65]
. Defendants historically have put forward marketing materials advertising the investor return from the Kraken Staking Program, including: 
** “At 6% compounded annually, we offer the highest fixed-rate returns in the industry.”
** “Enjoy one of the highest returns in the industry (12% for DOT and 7% for ATOM).”
** “Last year, we paid out over $27 million in token staking rewards … Want to earn up to 20% a year staking crypto assets?”
** “Staking is a great way to maximize your holdings in staking coins and fiat that would otherwise be sitting in your Kraken account. Once you have staked your assets you can earn staking rewards on top of your holdings and grow them further by compounding those future rewards.”
** “Your rewards will be compounded with the Grow Rewards feature, which adds your earned rewards every week back into On-chain staking. This means if you continue to leave your funds staked you may earn more than the RPY percent.”

[upperalpha,start=3]
. [underline]#*The Kraken Staking Program Has Generated Tens Of Millions Of Dollars In Investment Returns*#

[start=66]
. Throughout the relevant period, Defendants have offered the Kraken Staking Program to all U.S. residents except New York and Washington State residents. These U.S. residents have been able to “stake” fifteen different crypto assets through the Kraken Staking Program, summarized in the table below:

Supported Crypto Assets for U.S. Investors

[start=67]
. As of June 2022, there were more than 135,000 unique U.S.-based usernames investing in the Kraken Staking Program. 
. Since launching the Kraken Staking Program in December 2019 and through mid-2022, U.S. investors had staked over $2.7 billion worth of crypto assets in the Kraken Staking Program. Kraken has earned at least $147 million as net revenue throughout the life of the Program, of which at least $45.2 million is attributable to U.S. investors. Defendants’ net income attributable to U.S. investors in the Staking Program is $14.95 million. According to Kraken’s 2021 Annual Shareholder Update, “Staking was Kraken’s fastest growing product in 2021 and accounted for more than one-third of Kraken’s gross revenue growth.” As also stated in the same Update: “As we continue to support new staking assets and offer highly attractive rewards, clients are incentivized to keep more assets on platform, increasing the amount of capital available for clients to exchange between assets, driving volume growth and promoting client stickiness.” 

[upperroman, start=2]
. [underline]#*THE KRAKEN STAKING PROGRAM IS OFFERED AND SOLD AS A SECURITY*#

[start=69]
. At all relevant times, the Kraken Staking Program was offered and sold as an investment contract and therefore a security whose offers and sales were subject to the registration requirements of the federal securities laws. 

[upperalpha]
. [underline]#*Participants In The Kraken Staking Program Invest Money*#

[start=70]
. Defendants’ offer and sale of the Kraken Staking Program involves an investment of money. Under the Howey framework, an investment of “money” may but need not take the form of fiat currency. Here, investors purchase crypto assets from Defendants (with fiat or crypto assets) and then transfer them to the Defendants’ Kraken Staking Program; alternatively, investors transfer their own crypto assets to Defendants for staking.
. Investors put their crypto assets at risk as part of the Kraken Staking Program. Defendants have control over all the crypto assets invested in the Kraken Staking Program and choose when and how to use them. (As explained above, Defendants do not actually stake all crypto assets received from investors.) Moreover, according to the Kraken Terms of Service, these crypto assets may be encumbered by Kraken’s creditors. In addition, to the extent that an investor’s crypto assets actually are staked to the underlying blockchain protocol, those assets are at risk of being slashed.xref:sec_payward_footnote_5[^*(5)*^]
. Investors also have liquidity and market risk. Defendants market the Kraken Staking Program’s advantage of “instant unbonding” and instant return of “staked” crypto assets. But, as noted above, Defendants do not disclose the extent of their crypto-asset reserves and whether these reserves are sufficient to meet all redemption demands. If these reserves are insufficient, Kraken may be unable to honor a redemption request in a timely fashion, if at all. Investors could suffer market losses if the value of their crypto assets declines while waiting for redemption. 

[upperalpha, start=2]
. [underline]#*Investors And Defendants Participate In A Common Enterprise*#

[start=73]
. Investors in the Kraken Staking Program participate in a common enterprise with other investors and with Defendants.
. Investor tokens are transferred and pooled in wallets for the purposes of the Kraken Staking Program, and Defendants determine when and how many of these pooled tokens to stake. During this time, and for as long as the investor chooses to stake his or her tokens, investors receive a pre-calculated payout from Defendants. Defendants market that these payouts are distributed pro rata to investors depending on the amount of tokens they have staked (i.e., Defendants advertise a fixed return for all investors). Defendants do not segregate or separately manage an individual investor’s crypto assets as part of the Kraken Staking Program.
. The fortunes of investors and Defendants also are tied together in this common enterprise. For example, as explained above, the larger the pool of assets for staking, the higher the likelihood of obtaining rewards, which inures to the benefit of all investors and Defendants.
. In addition, the revenues and profits that Defendants stand to receive (i.e., the portion of the staking rewards that Defendants keep for themselves and use to fund their operations) grow as more investors participate in the Kraken Staking Program and purchase tokens on Kraken’s trading platform to stake. All rewards generated from the Kraken Staking Program also flow directly to Defendants, who determine whether and how many tokens in the pool to stake, and how often (and how much in rewards) to pay investors. If the pools are more successful in generating returns than Kraken’s advertised reward rates, Defendants retain the difference. Further, Defendants contribute their own tokens to the pool of tokens contributed by investors to the Kraken Staking Program when they engage in proof of stake activities.

[upperalpha, start=3]
. [underline]#*Investors Reasonably Expect To Profit From The Efforts Of Defendants*#

[start=77]
. Investors in the Kraken Staking Program reasonably expect to profit from Defendants’ efforts.
. From its inception, Defendants have marketed the Kraken Staking Program as an investment opportunity. As detailed above, through the kraken.com website, a Kraken blog, and social media channels, Defendants have promoted the Kraken Staking Program as a way for investors to earn a high investment return—“the highest fixed-rate returns in the industry.”
. Defendants also market the advantages of the Kraken Staking Program over staking independently. According to Defendants, these advantages include simplifying a complex staking process with an easy-to-use interface in a secure and trustworthy environment operated by technical experts.
. Investors are led to expect that Defendants will expend efforts to generate the investment returns. For example, Defendants advertise that they have the technical ability and expertise to stake crypto assets, to undertake strategies about when and how to stake crypto assets, and to obtain and manage the regular and frequent reward payouts. Defendants’ efforts are essential to the success or failure of the enterprise. 
. Moreover, because Defendants advertise that Defendants will retain a portion of the staking rewards, investors are reasonably led to expect that Defendants have strong financial incentives to engage in the efforts required to make the enterprise successful. 
. Defendants’ statements and actions, and the economic reality of the arrangements with respect to the Kraken Staking Program, have led and will continue to lead reasonable investors to expect Defendants to undertake significant and essential technical, managerial, and entrepreneurial efforts.

[upperroman, start=3]
. *DEFENDANTS HAVE FAILED TO REGISTER THE OFFERS AND SALES OF THE KRAKEN STAKING PROGRAM WITH THE COMMISSION*

[start=83]
. Defendants have used interstate commerce to offer and sell the Kraken Staking Program by, among other things, engaging in general solicitation through the kraken.com website and other promotional materials, including emails and social media. 
. Defendants have never had a registration statement filed or in effect with the SEC for their offers and sales of the Kraken Staking Program. No exemption from registration applied or applies.
. Defendants’ public disclosures have contained selective or no information about Defendants’ financial history, audited financial statements, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, and ability to generate profits. Investors in the Kraken Staking Program also have not received information about Defendants’ operations, financial condition, liabilities, or other factors relevant in considering whether to invest in the Kraken Staking Program. Investors further have lacked full and detailed information regarding how Defendants use reserves to meet redemptive requests (including whether there are segregated reserves and the extent of those reserves) and have been deprived of information about the staking rewards that Defendants keep for themselves. For example, Defendants do not disclose fees and expenses related to the Kraken Staking Program. Nor do Defendants disclose what they do with “unstaked” tokens, the extent to which Defendants are staking investor tokens, whether Defendants are lending, borrowing, trading, or otherwise alienating investor tokens into some enterprise other than staking protocols, whether and to what extent Defendants are commingling “unstaked” tokens with other assets, the source of rewards paid to investors particularly with respect to “unstaked” tokens, and sufficient information for investors to otherwise determine whether they are receiving a fair share of staking rewards from Defendants.

[underline]#*COMPLAINT*#

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC” or “Commission”), for its Complaint against Defendants Terraform Labs PTE Ltd. (“Terraform”) and Do Hyeong Kwon (“Kwon”) (collectively “Defendants”), alleges as follows: 

[.text-center]
*SUMMARY* 

. From at least April 2018 through May 2022 (“Relevant Period”), Terraform and Kwon offered and sold crypto asset securitiesxref:sec_kwonzi_footnote_1[^*(1)*^]  in unregistered transactions and perpetrated a fraudulent scheme that led to the loss of at least $40 billion of market value, including devastating losses for U.S. retail and institutional investors.   
. Defendants’ crypto asset securities offerings involved an array of interrelated tokens that were created, developed, promoted, offered, and sold by Defendants as profit-seeking investments. 
. Terraform and Kwon marketed the crypto asset securities to investors in the United States and abroad, repeatedly claiming that the tokens would increase in value and touting Defendants’ managerial and entrepreneurial efforts to do so.  For example, Defendants touted and marketed a Terraform-created “yield-bearing” blockchain protocol, dubbed the 
Anchor Protocol, which promised to pay 19-20% interest on one of Terraform’s crypto assets.  
. Defendants’ efforts at attracting investors and growing the size and value of the Terraform “ecosystem” were initially successful.  By April 2022, one of Terraform’s crypto asset securities, the LUNA token, had a market value among the ten highest in the world for crypto assets.  And Terraform’s so-called “stablecoin” Terra USD (“UST”) – a crypto asset security that Terraform designed to maintain a one-to-one peg to the U.S. dollar by virtue of an algorithm coded into the blockchain tying its value to LUNA – was also among the world’s largest, with a total market value of over $17 billion as of April 2022.   
. Defendants also engaged in a fraudulent scheme to mislead investors about the Terraform blockchain and its crypto asset securities.  Terraform and Kwon repeatedly – and falsely – told the investing public that a popular Korean electronic mobile payment application called “Chai” employed the Terraform blockchain to process and settle commercial transactions between customers and merchants.  If true, this would have been a breakthrough for the Terraform blockchain, a supposed real-world use that could increase the value of LUNA as demand for the token rose in connection with increased use of the Terraform blockchain. Investors bought in, purchasing LUNA and other Terraform crypto assets, based in part on Terraform’s and Kwon’s claims that Chai payment transactions were being processed and settled on the Terraform blockchain.  But in reality, Chai payments did not use the Terraform blockchain to process and settle payments.  Rather, Defendants deceptively replicated Chai payments onto the Terraform blockchain, in order to make it appear that they were occurring on the Terraform blockchain, when, in fact, Chai payments were made through traditional means.    
. Terraform and Kwon also misled investors about one of the most important aspects of Terraform’s offering – the stability of UST, the algorithmic “stablecoin” purportedly pegged to the U.S. dollar.  UST’s price falling below its $1.00 “peg” and not quickly being restored by the algorithm would spell doom for the entire Terraform ecosystem, given that UST and LUNA had no reserve of assets or any other backing.   
. In May 2021, UST dropped below $1.00.  In response, Defendants secretly discussed with a third party that the third party would purchase massive amounts of UST to restore the $1.00 peg.  As UST returned to $1.00, Kwon and Terraform publicly and repeatedly touted the restoration of the $1.00 UST peg as a triumph of decentralization and the “automatically self-heal[ing]” UST/LUNA algorithm over the “decision-making of human agents in time of market volatility,” misleadingly omitting the actual reason why the $1.00 peg was restored:  the third party’s intervention to prop up UST’s price.  By late May, Terraform was publicly boasting to the investing public that it had purportedly proven the reliability of the UST $1.00 peg – the “lynchpin for the entire [Terraform] ecosystem” – in a “black swan” event that was “as intense of a stress test in live conditions as can ever be expected.” 
. After the UST peg was restored in May 2021, investors poured additional billions of dollars into the Terraform ecosystem, mostly through investor purchases of LUNA and UST.     
. One year later, in May 2022, under selling pressure from large UST holders, UST de-pegged from the U.S. dollar again.  This time, without secret intervention to save it, the price of UST and LUNA plummeted to nearly zero, bringing down with them the other crypto asset securities in the interconnected Terraform ecosystem, wiping out over $40 billion of total market value in these assets and sending shock waves through the crypto asset community.  A number of retail investors in the United States lost their life savings.  And some U.S. institutional investors lost billions of dollars in the market value of their LUNA and UST holdings.

*VIOLATIONS*
[start=10]
. As a result of the conduct alleged in this Complaint, Defendants violated the securities offering registration provisions of the federal securities laws, namely Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 77e, along with certain security-based swap provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, Section 5(e) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77e, and Section 6(l) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 78f(l).  Specifically, Defendants offered and sold crypto asset securities to investors without registering the offers and sales with the SEC as required by the federal securities laws.  Defendants further violated the federal securities laws by offering, selling, and effecting transactions in securities-based swaps, in the form of “mAssets” based on the value of underling equity securities, to non-eligible contract participants in transactions that were not executed on a national securities exchange and without having an effective registration statement filed with the Commission covering the offer and sale. 
. Defendants’ conduct set forth in this Complaint also violated the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a), Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, along with Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78t(a).  
. Unless restrained and enjoined, Defendants will continue to violate the federal securities laws.  

[.text-center]
*NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS AND RELIEF SOUGHT*
[start=13]
. The Commission brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by Section 20(b) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77t(b), and Section 21(d)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(1).   
. The Commission seeks a final judgment: (i) ordering permanent injunctions restraining and enjoining Defendants from again violating the federal securities laws described herein; (ii) ordering Defendants to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest; (iii) ordering Defendants to pay civil money penalties; and (iv) prohibiting Defendants from (a) participating, directly or indirectly, in the purchase, offer, or sale of any crypto asset security, or (b) engaging in activities for purposes of inducing or attempting to induce the purchase, offer, or sale of any crypto asset security by others; and (v) imposing such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and appropriate. 

[.text-center]
*DEFENDANTS*
[start=15]
. Terraform Labs PTE Ltd. (“Terraform”) is a private company registered and headquartered in Singapore.  During the Relevant Period, Terraform had numerous employees located in the United States, including its General Counsel, Head of Research, and Director of Special Projects.  Terraform also operated a website available in the United States that offered and sold crypto asset securities to U.S.-based investors and, through its authorized representatives, often met with investors in the United States to offer and sell Terraform’s crypto asset securities.  Neither Terraform nor its offers or sales of crypto asset securities were registered with the SEC in any capacity.   
. Do Hyeong Kwon, age 31, was a resident of Korea and Singapore during the Relevant Period.  Kwon is and was the ultimate decision-maker at Terraform throughout the Relevant Period.  Kwon is also the sole director, Chief Executive Officer, and majority shareholder of Terraform, owning 92% if its shares.  Press reports indicate that a Korean court issued an arrest warrant for Kwon.  His current address is unknown.  During the Relevant Period, Kwon traveled to the United States on behalf of Terraform to market, offer, and sell Terraform’s crypto asset securities. 

[.text-center]
*JURISDICTION AND VENUE*
[start=17]
. The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d) and 22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d) and 77v(a), and Sections 21(d) and 27(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78aa(a). 
. The Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants and venue is proper in this District pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a), and Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a), because, among other things, some of the acts and transactions in which Defendants engaged and that constitute violations of the federal securities laws occurred in this District.  For example, as alleged herein, Defendants offered and sold securities and made materially false and misleading statements to investors located in this District in unregistered transactions.  One or more investors who purchased crypto asset securities offered by Terraform and Kwon also had their principal place of business and/or residence within this District.     
. In addition, this Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because Defendants engaged in conduct within the United States that constituted significant steps in furtherance of the violations of the federal securities laws alleged in this Complaint, even if some of the transactions at issue may have occurred outside the United States and involved foreign investors; and/or further because Defendants, whether within or outside of the United States, engaged in conduct that had a foreseeable substantial effect within the United States. 
. In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, Defendants, directly and indirectly, singly or in concert with others, have made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, the mails, and/or the facilities of a national securities exchange – namely, through Defendants’ use of the Internet and the U.S. banking system when engaging in the acts and transactions described herein.

[.text-center]  
*STATUTORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK*
[start=21]
. Congress enacted the Securities Act to regulate the offer and sale of securities. In contrast to ordinary commercial principles of caveat emptor, Congress enacted a regime of full and fair disclosure, requiring those who offer and sell securities to the investing public to provide sufficient, accurate information to allow investors to make informed decisions before they invest. 
. Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act require that an issuer of securities like Terraform register offers and sales of those securities with the SEC when they offer and sell securities to the public. Registration statements relating to an offering of securities thus provide public investors with material information about the issuer and the offering, including financial and managerial information, how the issuer will use offering proceeds, and the risks and trends that affect the enterprise and an investment in its securities. 
. The definition of a “security” under the federal securities laws includes a wide range of investment vehicles, including “investment contracts.  See 15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(1) (Securities Act Section 2(a)(1)).  Investment contracts are instruments through which a person invests money in a common enterprise and reasonably expects profits or returns derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. Courts have found that novel or unique investment vehicles constitute investment contracts, including interests in orange groves, animal breeding programs, railroads, mobile phones, crypt assets, and enterprises that exist only on the Internet. As the United States Supreme Court noted in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., Congress defined “security” broadly to embody a “flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.” 328 U.S. 293, 299 (1946). 
. Security based swaps, which are themselves securities, include any agreement, contract, or transaction that is a swap as defined in Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and is based on a single security, including on the value thereof.  See 15 U.S.C.  § 78c(a)(68) (Exchange Act Section 3(a)(68)).  Section 1a(47) of the CEA defines “swap” to include “any agreement, contract, or transaction” that “provides on an executory basis for the exchange . . . of 1 or more payments based on the value or level of 1 or more . . . securities . . . and that transfers, as between the parties to the transaction, in whole or in part, the financial risk associated with a future change in any such value or level without also conveying a current or future direct or indirect ownership interest in [the] asset . . . .”   
. Securities Act Section 5(e) makes it unlawful for any person to offer to sell, offer to buy, or purchase or sell a security-based swap to any person who is not an “eligible contract participant” without an effective registration statement.  15 U.S.C. § 77e(e).  Exchange Act Section 6(l) also makes it unlawful for any person to effect transactions in security-based swaps to any person who is not an “eligible contract participant” unless the transaction is effected on a registered national securities exchange.  “Eligible contract participants” are defined to include high-net-worth individuals with “amounts invested on a discretionary basis” of $10 million (or $5 million if the individual enters into a hedging agreement) and certain types of sophisticated and/or regulated entities.  7 U.S.C. § 1a(18).   

[.text-center]
*BACKGROUND ON CRYPTO ASSETS*
[start=26]
. The term “crypto asset” generally refers to an asset issued and/or transferred using distributed ledger or blockchain technology, including assets sometimes referred to as “cryptocurrencies,” “digital assets,” “virtual currencies,” “digital coins,” and “digital tokens.” 
. A blockchain or distributed ledger is a peer-to-peer database spread across a network of computers that records all transactions in theoretically unchangeable, digitally recorded data packages. The system relies on cryptographic techniques for secure recording of transactions.  Blockchains can also record “smart contracts,” essentially computer programs designed to execute the terms of a contract when certain triggering conditions are met. 
. Blockchains typically employ a consensus mechanism to “validate” transactions, which, among other things, aims to achieve agreement on a data value or on the state of the ledger.  Crypto assets may be traded on crypto asset trading platforms in exchange for other crypto assets or fiat currency (legal tender issued by a country). 
. A blockchain “protocol” is a code, software, or algorithm that governs how a blockchain, or a feature of a blockchain, operates. 
. On July 25, 2017, the SEC issued the Report of Investigation Pursuant to Section 
21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO, advising “those who would use . . . distributed ledger or blockchain-enabled means for capital raising[] to take appropriate steps to ensure compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws,” and finding that the offering of crypto assets at issue in that report involved investment contracts and, therefore, securities.  In analyzing whether something is a security, “form should be disregarded for substance,” Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967), “and the emphasis should be on economic realities underlying a transaction, and not on the name appended thereto.” United Housing Found., Inc. v. Forman, 421 U.S. 837, 849 (1975).

*FACTS*
[upperroman]
. *Defendants Created and Developed the Terraform Ecosystem.*

[start=31]
. In March 2018, Defendants began creating the Terraform ecosystem.  Kwon and Terraform’s co-founder published a white paper announcing the Terraform blockchain (referred to as the “Terra protocol”) and the LUNA token, the first crypto asset created by Terraform.  Eventually, the ecosystem would come to include a series of interconnected crypto assets whose purported adoption, liquidity, and value became highly dependent on the public’s willingness to buy into Terraform and Kwon’s blockchain empire. 
. In April 2019, Kwon and others published another white paper, entitled “Terra Money: Stability and Adoption,” that announced the adoption of so-called “stable-coins,” including one later named UST, which Terraform described as the “lynchpin” of Defendants’ interrelated “ecosystem” of crypto assets. 
. In the April 2019 white paper and elsewhere, Defendants stated that UST’s value was pegged to the U.S. dollar by virtue of an algorithm tying UST’s value to LUNA. Specifically, this algorithm sought to maintain UST’s price at $1.00 through a complex system in which, rather than being backed by actual dollars, UST would be created, or “minted,” and “burned,” or destroyed, in parallel with Terraform’s companion token, LUNA.  For example, holders of LUNA could swap $1.00 worth of LUNA for 1 UST based on LUNA’s then-current market price.  And holders of UST could likewise exchange 1 UST for $1.00 worth of LUNA.  The algorithm theoretically provided an arbitrage opportunity for traders to help keep the price of UST pegged at one dollar.  If, for example, UST slipped to $0.95, traders could buy UST at that price and exchange it for $1 of LUNA “burning” UST and “minting” LUNA.  Doing so reduced the supply of UST and, in theory, would increase its price until it reached a dollar. 
. On or about April 24, 2019, Terraform and Kwon officially launched the Terraform blockchain and created one billion LUNA tokens.  Kwon wrote the code underlying the initial version of the blockchain.  As described in more detail below, Terraform and Kwon offered and sold LUNA to investors to raise funds to develop the Terraform blockchain and ecosystem.  During the Relevant Period, Terraform maintained over a hundred code repositories that enabled Terraform employees, including Kwon, to create, contribute, maintain, and update the Terraform blockchain protocols. 
. Throughout the Relevant Period, Terraform and Kwon continued to develop and market the Terraform blockchain and related protocols and crypto assets, which they promoted as profit opportunities for investors.  In September 2020, for example, Terraform and Kwon began publicly marketing UST as a “yield bearing” stablecoin together with something they called the Anchor Protocol.  Terraform launched the Anchor Protocol in March 2021, with Defendants advertising rates of return of 19-20% on investors’ deposited UST, leading to significant investor demand for UST.  
. The total amount of UST, which was first “minted” in June 2019, was slow to grow, with under 300 million UST circulating by early 2021.  In the 2 months following the launch of the Anchor Protocol, the number of UST in circulation increased by close to one billion.  By May 2022, there were approximately 19 billion UST, with 14 billion deposited in the Anchor Protocol.   
. Over time, Defendants created other protocols and crypto asset securities.  In December 2020, Defendants launched the “Mirror Protocol,” which they continued to develop and maintain.  The Mirror Protocol allowed users to create what Terraform called an “mAsset,” short for “mirrored asset”, which was designed to track or “mirror” the price of equity securities or other types of securities, including U.S. equity securities.  For example, mAssets designed to “mirror” the stock of Apple, Inc. were named “mAAPL” and were designed so that their value increased and decreased with the value of Apple, Inc. stock.  As Terraform explained on its website, “mAssets mimic the price behavior of real-world assets and give traders anywhere in the world open access to price exposure without the burdens of owning or transacting real assets.”   
. The Mirror Protocol also provided users with the ability to obtain a “MIR token,” the so-called “governance token”xref:sec_kwonzi_footnote_2[^*(2)*^]  for the Mirror Protocol.  MIR tokens received value based upon, among other things, fees generated under the Mirror Protocol.

[upperroman, start=2]
.	*Terraform’s Crypto Assets Were Offered and Sold As Securities.*

[start=39]
. As alleged in greater detail below, Terraform offered and sold five groups of crypto asset securities: LUNA tokens, a version of LUNA called “wrapped” LUNA, UST, MIR tokens, and security-based swaps or mAssets.  Defendants solicited investors for these crypto assets by touting their profit potential.  Defendants repeatedly stated that the crypto assets would increase in value based on Terraform’s development, maintenance, and promotion of its blockchain, protocols, and the entire Terraform ecosystem.  Defendants also promoted to investors the ability to trade Terraform’s crypto assets on the secondary market, with the success of the investment again depending on Defendants’ efforts.   
. Defendants further touted the professional expertise and success of the Terraform team, including Kwon, claiming that Terraform was “led by serial entrepreneurs” and was a team with “deep relevant expertise,” and providing biographies or links to LinkedIn profiles that highlighted Terraform employees’ and Kwon’s expertise in crypto assets, finance, and technical experience with software coding, engineering, and development.  
. In addition, Defendants advertised their considerable efforts to ensure that UST – the “lynchpin of the [Terraform] ecosystem” – maintained its $1.00 peg.  In January 2022, Defendants announced the creation of the “Luna Foundation Guard,” which had no employees and was controlled by Kwon, with the purpose of serving as an “asset reserve [] to back the UST.”  The Luna Foundation Guard was funded with a “gift” of 50 million LUNA (at the time, worth billions of dollars) directly from Terraform.  
. Defendants also aggressively marketed Terraform’s crypto asset securities to U.S. investors, by posting information and promotional materials to accounts on several publicly accessible online social media platforms, such as Twitter accounts, blog posts, YouTube, and messaging applications like Telegram.  Kwon and other Terraform employees further gave interviews or quotes to media promoting its crypto assets, including U.S.-based outlets, as described in greater detail below.   
. Additionally, during the Relevant Period, Kwon and other Terraform employees traveled to the United States to meet personally with existing and potential investors to solicit investment in Terraform’s crypto asset securities, including meetings in San Francisco and New York, and to attend and speak at an industry conference and events in New York.  Defendants’ U.S.-based promotional efforts also included a partnership with the Washington Nationals baseball team, as a result of which the word “Terra” was placed on every seat behind home plate and elsewhere around the stadium in Washington, D.C.  Defendants also arranged to have several of their crypto assets listed (made available for trading) on several major crypto asset trading platforms, including a prominent U.S.-based trading platform.  

[upperalpha]
.. *LUNA*
[numeric]  
... *Investment of Money.* 

[start=44]
. Investors tendered fiat currency or crypto assets in exchange for LUNA. Institutional investors typically purchased LUNA directly from Terraform after meeting with Kwon in person or via videoconference.  U.S. retail (or non-institutional) investors, who purchased LUNA from crypto asset trading platforms, including at least one trading platform in the U.S., also tendered fiat currency or crypto assets in exchange for LUNA. 

[numeric, start=2]    
...	*Common Enterprise.* 

[start=45]
. Purchasers of LUNA invested into a common enterprise with other LUNA purchasers, as well as with Terraform and Kwon. 
. Terraform and Kwon pooled the funds received from investors to develop the Terraform ecosystem and increase the value of LUNA.  Investors in LUNA shared equally in LUNA price increases, or suffered LUNA price decreases equally, such that if one investor profited, all investors did so as well.  Because LUNA is fungible, the fortunes of LUNA purchasers were tied to one another, and each depended on the success of Defendants’ efforts and strategy and the Terraform ecosystem.   
. Specifically, proceeds of Terraform’s sales of LUNA were sent to crypto asset wallet addresses controlled by Terraform to fund Terraform’s efforts to develop and fund operations.  During fundraising presentations, Terraform and Kwon explained how Terraform would use proceeds from LUNA sales to help grow and expand the Terraform ecosystem.  For example, in August 2018, when Terraform announced its first raise of capital of $32 million, it noted that “Terra will invest the initial seed capital in building the modern financial system on the blockchain.”  In fact, Terraform presentations to investors stated that at least 20% of the initial billion LUNA tokens were to be used for development and operations.   
. Moreover, throughout the Relevant Period, Defendants held a significant amount of LUNA, tying their fortunes with respect to LUNA with LUNA investors’ fortunes.  Terraform owned hundreds of millions of LUNA tokens through the Relevant Period.  In 2020, Kwon tweeted that he had purchased 50 million LUNA, in addition to the 70 million LUNA tokens that he owned from the time of the blockchain launch in 2019.

[numeric, start=3]
... *Reasonable Expectation of Profits From Defendants’ Managerial Efforts.*

[start=49] 	 
. Investors in LUNA reasonably expected to profit from Defendants’ efforts to develop and support the Terraform ecosystem.   
. Defendants publicly pitched LUNA as an investment that would increase in value with increased usage of the Terraform blockchain that could result from Defendants’ continued development and maintenance.  Defendants publicly stated that as the Terraform ecosystem grew based on Defendants’ efforts, the value of LUNA would go up as well.  As Kwon explained in an April 7, 2021 thread on Twitter (referring to LUNA as “moon”): 

image::media/ch03_kwonzi_01.jpg[]

[start=51]  
. In the same April 7, 2021 thread, Kwon explicitly touted that the value of LUNA could grow as the Terraform “ecosystem” grows, specifically tying that potential growth to his own efforts (which he promised would be successful by touting that he would “kick ass”) while investors remained passive (or “s[a]t back”) in the enterprise.   

image::media/ch03_kwonzi_02.jpg[]

[start=52]
. As one Terraform employee put it in Terraform’s publicly-available Telegram messaging application, the “[v]alue of Luna grows as Terra [ecosystem] gets adopted and used.” Another Terraform employee noted in an online Ask-Me-Anything interview on Reddit: “[i]n the long-run … Terra’s transaction volume will be the main determinant of Luna’s value.”xref:sec_kwonzi_footnote_3[^*(3)*^]   
. In marketing materials distributed to potential investors in January 2019, Terraform described purchases of LUNA as “investments” and LUNA buyers as “investors.”  The same materials noted that “top global exchanges and funds” already had “invested in” Terraform (referring to their purchase of LUNA), and that Terraform had raised $32 million in July 2018 from an “elite group of VCs” referring to venture capital firms. 
. Some of Terraform’s offers and sales of LUNA were governed by purchase agreements between Terraform and LUNA investors.  These agreements generally entitled buyers to acquire LUNA at a discount to market prices.  By selling at a discount to market prices, Defendants incentivized buyers to seek to sell their LUNA into public markets in order to realize a profit.  Moreover, for some buyers who purchased LUNA prior to the public launch of the token, Defendants provided in some of the agreements for a gradated token distribution schedule that would control for the flow of LUNA tokens being sold into the market, such that early investors would receive their LUNA continuously over a period of 12-18 months.  These provisions controlled the release of LUNA over a longer period of time in smaller quantities, to control for potential negative effects on LUNA’s price that could occur with large distributions of LUNA into the market.  These provisions reflected the expectations of both Defendants and investors that that these LUNA investors would seek to sell their LUNA into public markets for a profit and sought to protect LUNA’s trading price by limiting amounts that could be resold during any given time period.
. Defendants also engaged in efforts to develop, support, and grow the Terraform ecosystem.  Defendants publicly touted these efforts through a variety of forums, including widely accessible online social media platforms, such as accounts with Twitter and Medium, messaging applications with public channels like Telegram, and YouTube.  Terraform’s stated efforts to grow the Terraform ecosystem included four substantial version upgrades of the Terraform blockchain, adding myriad back-end technical features and front-end user applications, entering into partnerships with collaborators to develop ecosystem features, and otherwise extensively and publicly promoting the Terraform ecosystem. 
. As Defendants engaged in and touted these efforts, the market price of LUNA increased from under a dollar in early 2021 to a high of around $119.18 in April 2022, before it crashed to under a penny in May 2022, as represented by the graph below: 

image::media/ch03_kwonzi_03.jpg[]

[start=57]
. Defendants also provided monthly “Community Updates” on publicly available Medium blog posts, which discussed Defendants’ coding and development the Terraform ecosystem.  Similarly, Terraform employees and Kwon touted their efforts to develop and support the Terraform ecosystem in monthly investor emails that they distributed called “Terraform Labs Investor Update” (later renamed to “Terraform Labs Ecosystem Update”).  The recipients of these “Updates” had email addresses that included, for example, an email group investment@terra.money.  These emails highlighted Terraform’s engineering, coding, and integration of applications to the Terraform ecosystem, among other things.  These emails also announced new Terraform hiring for positions “key” to the ecosystem’s development. 
. Terraform and Kwon also engaged in other efforts to create LUNA resale opportunities by applying to crypto asset trading platforms to make LUNA available for trading, including submitting questionnaires that provided information about LUNA and Terraform, and then furthered LUNA investors’ reasonable expectations of profits by publicly announcing new trading platform listings.

[upperalpha, start=2]
	.. *“Wrapped” LUNA*

[start=59] 
. Some crypto assets, like UST, LUNA, and the MIR tokens on the Terraform blockchain, are issued and transferred on a particular blockchain – meaning that they are represented on that blockchain.  Generally speaking, different blockchains are not interoperable with one another.  In other words, crypto assets on one blockchain cannot be automatically transferred to another blockchain.   
. To address this limitation, “cross-chain” and “bridge” protocols were created to allow investors to move value across blockchains.  One example is the “wrapped” LUNA token (or “wLUNA”).  These wLUNA tokens are generally created, or “bridged,” from the Terraform blockchain to another blockchain by depositing LUNA in a particular wallet address on the Terraform blockchain, and then having an associated smart contract on different blockchains, such as the Ethereum blockchain, to create wLUNA. 
. Similarly, wLUNA could be bridged back to the Terra blockchain by having wLUNA destroyed, or “burned,” by the smart contract on the non-Terraform blockchains and receiving LUNA from the address or smart contract on the Terraform blockchain.  In essence, this mechanism created a pool of LUNA on the Terraform blockchain, through which wLUNA owners could convert their holdings back into LUNA.

[numeric]
...	*Investment of Money.*
 
[start=62]
. Investors purchased wLUNA with other crypto assets or with fiat currency through crypto asset trading platforms.  For example, to create wLUNA, investors deposited LUNA to an address or smart contract on the Terraform blockchain, which was then “bridged” to the Ethereum or other blockchains to create wLUNA.   

[numeric, start=2]
...	*Common Enterprise.*

[start=63]
. Investors in wLUNA invested in a common enterprise with other wLUNA investors and LUNA investors.  To create wLUNA, LUNA was pooled together in an address or smart contract on the Terraform blockchain.  For each LUNA that entered into the pool, a new wLUNA would be created on a different blockchain, such as Ethereum.   
. As LUNA and wLUNA were exchangeable on a one-to-one basis, the price of wLUNA generally equaled the price of LUNA.  Therefore, holders of wLUNA shared in the rise and fall of the value of the wLUNA and LUNA token.  As a result, the fortunes of wLUNA investors were tied to one another and to the fortunes of Defendants. 

[numeric, start=3]
...	*Expectation of Profits from Defendants’ Managerial Efforts.* 

[start=65] 
. Just like LUNA investors, investors in wLUNA had an expectation of profits based on the managerial efforts of Defendants because the price of wLUNA, by definition, equaled the price of LUNA. 
. Reasonable investors purchasing wLUNA either understood this economic reality, or believed that they were purchasing LUNA when they were in fact purchasing wLUNA.  In fact, Kwon himself used the terms LUNA and wLUNA interchangeably.  For instance, when Kwon tweeted about wLUNA’s availability on a prominent U.S.-based trading platform, he referred to it as “$LUNA,” which is how he frequently referred to LUNA. 
. Regardless of whether investors understood the difference between LUNA and wLUNA, investors purchased wLUNA with the understanding that the value of the token would be driven by the value of LUNA.  As described above, Defendants led investors to reasonably expect to profit from LUNA, and therefore wLUNA, based on the managerial efforts of Terraform and Kwon to develop the Terraform ecosystem.

. The definition of security under Securities Act 2(a)(1) and Exchange Act Section 3(a)(10) includes a “receipt for” a security. As described above, when an investor “bridges” LUNA to obtain wLUNA, the owner of the wLUNA has the right and ability at any time to exchange the wLUNA for LUNA, which was offered and sold as a security.  This mechanism created a pool of LUNA on the Terraform blockchain through which wLUNA owners could convert their holdings back into LUNA. As a result, wLUNA is also a security because it is a receipt for a security.

.. *UST*
[numeric, start=1]
... *Investment of Money.*
 
[numeric, start=69]
. Investors tendered fiat currency or crypto assets in exchange for UST.  As advertised by Defendants, to “earn” nearly 20% annual returns via the Anchor Protocol, investors deposited their UST into a smart contract associated with the Anchor Protocol.

[numeric, start=2]
... *Common Enterprise.*

[start=70]
. Investors in UST invested in a common enterprise with other UST purchasers, as well as with Terraform and Kwon. 
. Defendants created, developed, updated and maintained profit-bearing opportunities for UST, including the yield-bearing “Anchor Protocol” to generate profits for UST purchasers.  Defendants’ Anchor Protocol pooled UST investor funds and lent them out to borrowers to generate returns for the investors.  Defendants’ Anchor Protocol also did not manage individual or separate accounts for investors.  If deployment of funds within the Anchor Protocol was successful in generating returns, all investors profited equally in proportion to their investment.  Accordingly, each investor’s fortune was tied to the fortunes of the other investors. 
. UST investors’ fortunes were also tied to Defendants’ fortunes.  Terraform and Kwon both deposited UST, sometimes in the millions or tens-of millions, respectively, into the Anchor Protocol.  Kwon tweeted in May 2021 that Terraform owned $59 million in UST, and Kwon consistently held in excess of 1 million UST, further showing that investors’ fortunes were tied to the fortunes of Defendants.  
. That Defendants’ and investors’ fortunes were tied to each other and to the success of the Anchor Protocol was demonstrated when, in May 2022, the UST de-peg resulted in the collapse of the Terraform ecosystem and left the UST held by investors and Defendants nearly valueless. 

[numeric, start=3]
... *Reasonable Expectation of Profits Based on the Managerial Efforts of Defendants.*
 
[start=74] 
. Defendants led UST/Anchor Protocol investors to reasonably expect profits based on Defendants’ managerial efforts.  
. As advertised by Defendants, to “earn” what Terraform advertised as nearly 20% annual returns via the Anchor Protocol, investors deposited their UST into a smart contract associated with the Anchor Protocol.  Just prior to the collapse of the Terraform ecosystem in early May 2022, over 70% of UST was deposited into the Anchor Protocol, meaning that investors deposited into the protocol close to 14 billion (or nearly 74 percent) of the almost 19 billion in overall UST.    
. Defendants also engaged in efforts to engineer, develop, and support the Anchor Protocol, for the purpose of maintaining the promised returns to investors.  Defendants touted these efforts to investors in their monthly investor updates, including, among other things, their efforts building out its front-end user access and back-end features, facilitating user access to the protocol through third-parties’ crypto asset financial services, and funding and managing the Anchor Protocol “yield reserve,” which was used to pay investors interest on their UST.  
. Specifically, when revenue from the Anchor Protocol was not sufficient to cover its advertised returns to UST depositors, Terraform and Kwon sought to ensure that the Anchor Protocol had enough reserve assets to pay investors the promised interest and continue attracting 
UST/Anchor Protocol investors.   
. For example, in July 2021, Terraform provided approximately $70 million of UST to the Anchor Protocol yield reserve.  By early 2022, the yield reserve was quickly running out of money, and it again was topped up by the Luna Foundation Guard with another approximately $450 million of UST.  This replenishment was directed by Kwon, who at the time was the director of the Luna Foundation Guard.  At Kwon’s request and authorization, the Luna Foundation Guard directed some of its LUNA to the Anchor Protocol to be converted into UST and deposited into the yield reserve. 
. Defendants touted that returns to UST investors from the Anchor Protocol were derived from their efforts supporting the Anchor Protocol, highlighting in public statements and statements to groups of investors that Defendants’ work would support the Anchor Protocol and its yield rate.  For example, in January 2022, Kwon tweeted publicly about Defendants’ efforts to support the Anchor Protocol’s yield reserve: 

image::media/ch03_kwonzi_04.jpg[]

[start=80]
. Defendants also took drastic steps to maintain UST’s “peg” to the U.S. dollar, including by gifting the Luna Foundation Guard billions of dollars to buy UST in the event of the price of UST going below $1 and “defend the peg.” 
. Many domestic retail investors purchased UST for the sole purpose of earning a return on the Anchor Protocol developed and maintained by Defendants.   
. These U.S. retail investors, all of whom lost nearly their entire UST investments in May 2022, lacked the technical expertise to generate returns with respect to their UST purchase for themselves.  They included a musician in Venice, California; a pharmacist in Cypress, California; a painter in Brattleboro, Vermont; an accountant in Stockton, California; an engineer in Knoxville, Tennessee; and an IT worker in Orange County, California.  Many lacked significant investment experience and educated themselves about UST and the Anchor Protocol via the Internet and social media.  They considered UST to be safe with an almost 20% yield when invested in the Anchor Protocol, as marketed by Terraform and Kwon.   
. For much of the Relevant Period, UST and the Anchor Protocol appeared to meet investors’ expectations.  With the exception of a brief episode in May 2021 (discussed below), the price of UST remained pegged to the U.S. dollar until plummeting to under a penny and wiping out billions of dollars of investor money in May 2022. 

[numeric,start=4]
...	*UST Is a Security Because It Could Be Exchanged for LUNA*

[start=84]
. UST is also a security because it gave investors a “right to subscribe or purchase” another securityxref:sec_kwonzi_footnote_4[^*(4)*^]—namely, it could be exchanged for LUNA, another security as detailed above.  Given that UST investors had the right to convert UST to one dollar’s worth of LUNA via the Terraform blockchain, investors who bought UST had the right to subscribe to or purchase a security (i.e. LUNA). 

[upperalpha, start=4]
.. *MIR Tokens*
[numeric,start=1] 
... *Investment of Money.*

[start=85]
. Investors in MIR tokens tendered crypto assets or fiat currency in exchange for MIR.     

[numeric,start=2] 
... *Common Enterprise.*

[start=86] 
. Investors in MIR tokens invested in a common enterprise with other MIR token purchasers, as well as with Defendants.
. Proceeds of the sales of MIR tokens were pooled together to develop and fund Terraform operations and, specifically, the Mirror Protocol.  The ability of a MIR investor to profit was dependent on the success of the Mirror Protocol because MIR increased in value with increased usage of the Mirror Protocol.   
. Moreover, MIR tokens are fungible and interchangeable with each other.  MIR investors shared equally in MIR price increases, or suffered MIR price decreases equally, such that if one investor profited, all investors did so as well. 
. After the launch of the Mirror Protocol, Terraform “farmed” MIR tokens to distribute to investors pursuant to agreements between investors and a wholly owned subsidiary of Terraform which were signed by Kwon.  Terraform farmed more MIR tokens than it was required to distribute, and retained or sold the excess tokens.  If the price of MIR increased (or decreased), both Defendants and investors would benefit (or suffer losses) in proportion to their holdings, thus tying the MIR investors’ fortunes to those of Defendants.

[numeric,start=3] 
... *Reasonable Expectation of Profits Based on Defendants’ Managerial  Efforts.*
 
[start=90]
. Defendants touted an investment in MIR as a way for investors to invest in the potential success of the Mirror Protocol. 
. Investors bought MIR with the expectation that the price of MIR would increase based on Defendants’ managerial efforts.  Defendants told investors that the price of the MIR was directly correlated with Terraform’s and Kwon’s efforts to increase the usage of the Mirror Protocol because its value was dependent on the fees generated by usage of the Mirror Protocol. In promotional materials provided to investors in September 2020, Terraform noted that 
Defendants would heavily promote the Mirror Protocol, which would increase the price of the MIR tokens.  These materials also provided a revenue projections table that estimated the price of MIR based on how much the Mirror Protocol was used. 
. Defendants further held themselves out to the public as managing and working on the Mirror Protocol as part of their work to build out the Terraform ecosystem.   
. Consistent with their public touting, Defendants engaged in entrepreneurial and managerial efforts to make the Mirror Protocol a successful enterprise.  For example, they controlled websites related to the Mirror Protocol that promoted, explained, and facilitated its use for the general public.   
. Defendants, in fact, controlled many aspects of the Mirror Protocol and engaged in myriad efforts to facilitate and support its function. For example, Terraform engineered, launched, and upgraded versions of the Mirror Protocol.  In addition to employing engineers responsible for coding and substantially upgrading the Mirror Protocol, Terraform also employed a “product manager” for the Mirror Protocol.  Terraform further controlled a mechanism that provided a price check on the underlying assets for the mAssets for the purpose of facilitating the creation and liquidation of mAssets on the protocol.   
. Terraform and Kwon also promoted the Mirror Protocol through, among other means, Terraform’s website, web application, social media accounts, podcast interviews, and through U.S. media.  Kwon tweeted extensively prior to and after the release of the Mirror Protocol, noting Terraform’s continued participation and partnerships to help the project succeed.  Upon announcing the Mirror Protocol to the public in December 2020, Kwon tweeted 
“Going forward, we look forward to being active contributors in the community to help @mirror_protocol succeed.”  Following the launch of the Mirror Protocol, Terraform and Kwon advertised it aggressively, including in blog posts, tweets and interviews.  In January 2021, a Mirror Community update on the Mirror Medium page stated, “We’re always working hard to improve Mirror and rely on our brilliant community for feedback and ideas.”  Terraform and Kwon also regularly emailed updates about Terraform’s work and development on the Terraform ecosystem, including to an email group with the recipient name of “mirror_investors.”  
. Terraform employees also engaged in public and extensive entrepreneurial and managerial efforts with respect to the Mirror Protocol, including by heavily promoting it and touting its growth in public presentations.  For example, in June 2021, Terraform’s U.S.-based Director of Special Projects provided a presentation to the “Defi Summit” on behalf of Terraform that included an extensive discussion of Terraform’s Mirror Protocol.  Among other things, Terraform’s Director of Special Projects stated that, not only was Terraform responsible for launching the Mirror Protocol, but “we’ve grown [the Mirror Protocol] to two billion [dollars] in total value locked and one million [dollars] in liquidity.”  He also discussed how “we just want to create a very delightful and magical experience . . . for users providing a Robinhood-like interface.”  Additionally, Terraform’s Business Development lead and its Head of Communications participated in an interview that publicized and explained the Mirror Protocol, noting that Terraform has a “team of [approximately] 40 people working full-time across Asia/US.”  The article explained that “Mirror is a synthetic assets protocol” and that Terraform planned to expand Mirror “beyond SE Asia and the typical US market.”  

[upperalpha, start=5]
.. *mAsset Transactions Were Security-Based Swaps*

[start=97] 
. Terraform’s Mirror Protocol permitted the creation of assets—called “mAssets”— that “mirrored” the price of securities.  The mAssets were created when, based on the smart contract coded into the Terraform blockchain, an investor provided a payment equal to 150% of the value of the security that the mAsset mirrored.  In return, the investor received an mAsset equal to the value of the security that the mAsset was designed to mirror, such as the stock of Apple, Inc. 
. Once an mAsset was created, if the price of the referenced security rose so that the collateral rate was no longer satisfied, the investor was required to deposit additional collateral based on the value of such increases or the investor’s collateral would be liquidated. 
. The investor could terminate the transaction by making a final payment in the form of the mAsset (also called “burning” or returning the mAsset).  At the point of the termination of the transaction, the investor was entitled to receive payment back in the form of the entire collateral.  
. For example, an investor could create an “mAAPL” mAsset by making a payment equal to at least 150% of the value of Apple stock into a smart contract on the Mirror Protocol.  In return, the investor received “mAAPL.”  If the actual price of Apple stock rose in value, the investor was required to deposit additional payments such that the investor’s collateral equaled 150% of the now increased value of Apple, or else the collateral would be liquidated and a portion paid back to the investor.  The investor could terminate the transaction by paying the mAAPL back to the smart contract in the Mirror Protocol, at which point the investor was entitled to receive a payment back of all of the investor’s collateral. 
. Each transaction offering or selling an mAsset thus constituted a security-based swap.  First, each transaction provided on an executory basis for an exchange of a payment, based on the value of a security.  That is, an investor provided a payment in the form of collateral equal to at least 150% of the value of the security (e.g., Apple stock) that the mAsset mirrored, in exchange for an mAsset (e.g., mAAPL).
. Second, each transaction transferred, between the investor and the Mirror Protocol, the financial risk associated with a future change in the value of a security without also conveying a current or future direct or indirect ownership interest in the underlying security.  This is because the mAsset (e.g., “mAAPL”) tracked the rise or fall in price of the underlying security, (e.g., Apple stock), but did not convey any direct or indirect interest in the underlying security (i.e., the investor in mApple did not own any direct or indirect interest in Apple stock even though the value of her mApple tracked the change in value of Apple stock). 
. The mAsset transactions were generally offered, sold, or effected through the Mirror Protocol (and not a registered national securities exchange) with or for persons who were not eligible contract participants, in violation of Securities Act Section 5(e) and Exchange Act Section 6(l). 

[upperroman, start=3]
. *Defendants Offered and Sold Crypto Asset Securities in Unregistered Transactions*
 
[start=104]
. Beginning in 2018 and continuing until the collapse of the Terraform ecosystem in May 2022, Defendants engaged in capital fundraising activities through the unregistered offering and sales of the crypto asset securities described above.   
. With respect to LUNA, the unregistered public offering included a pre-seed and seed round, a public initial sale, loans of LUNA for distribution into the market for resales, and 
Terraform’s direct sales on crypto asset trading platforms.   
. From at least April 2018 through September 2018, as part of one continuous offering, Terraform sold close to 200 million LUNA to institutional investors, including at least one U.S. entity, and offshore entities controlled by U.S. entities.  The terms of these sales imposed no restrictions on when those tokens could be resold by the investors.  Terraform distributed to some of the investors less than a year after the executed agreements, and Kwon signed the purchase agreements.  The terms of these agreements reflect the expectation that most, if not all, of these purchasers would sell their LUNA into public markets.  In other words, Defendants were essentially embarking on a large-scale unregistered public distribution of LUNA.    
. Between January and late February 2019, Terraform also sold approximately $60,000 worth of LUNA in a worldwide sale that was advertised on Terraform’s publicly available messaging channels and through email.  The offering involved general solicitations into the United States.  Defendants also contracted with a company to make the LUNA available to investors worldwide online.  Investors in these sales were told by Defendants that they would receive the tokens for a discount on market prices three months after the token launch.  The LUNA tokens that Terraform and Kwon sold did not restrict purchaser resales into the United States or elsewhere. 
. Later that year, in November 2019, Terraform and its wholly owned subsidiary loaned 30 million LUNA to a U.S.-based proprietary trading firm (the “U.S. Trading Firm”).  Kwon emailed a small group of investors to inform them that the purpose of the transaction was to “improve liquidity” of LUNA, because of the “lackluster [ ] performance of the LUNA token.”  In July 2020, the U.S. Trading Firm began actively selling LUNA into the market, allowing public investors to purchase LUNA through transactions in secondary markets.   
. In September 2020, Terraform and its wholly owned subsidiary “loaned” an additional 65 million LUNA to the U.S. Trading Firm.  In order to receive the LUNA, the U.S. Trading Firm had to meet certain thresholds related to trading in UST.  It met the first threshold and began receiving LUNA pursuant to the loan from Terraform in January 2021.  The U.S. Trading Firm subsequently began continuously selling LUNA into the market, including through a major U.S. crypto asset trading platform once that platform began listing LUNA in August 2021.  Terraform’s “loan” to the U.S. Trading Firm and the U.S. Trading Firm’s subsequent sales thus allowed public investors, including those in the U.S., to acquire or transact in LUNA through transactions in the secondary market and generated speculative interest in LUNA.   
. These two transactions between Terraform, its subsidiary, and the U.S. Trading Firm, which are described in more detail below, were, in essence, public distributions of LUNA by Terraform.  The U.S. Trading Firm acquired the LUNA from Terraform and its subsidiary and sold it into the market directly with Terraform’s knowledge and expressed intent that the LUNA provided would be so distributed in order to “improve liquidity.” 
. During the Relevant Period, LUNA was also made available for trading on multiple crypto asset trading platforms.  From at least August 2019, through at least February 2022, Terraform sold billions of dollars of LUNA directly into secondary markets through transactions on crypto asset trading platforms, including those available to U.S. investors.    
. Prior to the launch of the Mirror Protocol, Terraform and Kwon raised over three million dollars by selling more than 37 million MIR tokens through agreements between investors and a wholly owned subsidiary of Terraform.  These agreements were signed by Kwon and entered into with at least six U.S. purchasers.  The contracts were signed in September of 2020, and the MIR tokens became available to these pre-launch purchasers by January or 
February of 2021.   
. Terraform and Kwon sold these 37 million MIR tokens without restricting the resale of their tokens and did not take any steps to verify investors’ accredited status.  Although there is no indication of general solicitation, no exemptions to registration were available given the fact that tokens sold in this offering were available for resale on an unrestricted basis less than a year after the initial transactions.   
. In addition to selling MIR tokens pre-launch, Terraform also later sold them directly into the market through crypto asset trading platforms and made them available on the Terraform-controlled website for the Mirror Protocol that could be accessed in the U.S. Terraform entered into a listing agreement with at least one U.S. crypto asset trading platform for the listing of MIR tokens on the platform.  In addition, Terraform and Kwon “loaned” MIR tokens to market makers with no restrictions on resale, who then sold the loaned MIR upon receipt on U.S.-based crypto asset trading platforms and other crypto asset trading platforms that are available to U.S. investors. Again, the terms of these transactions reflect the expectation that these market makers would sell their MIR tokens into public markets. 
. Beginning in late 2020, Terraform also created, offered, sold, and effected transactions in mAssets through the Mirror Protocol.  Terraform and Kwon offered and sold mAssets by (i) creating and maintaining the Mirror Protocol, (ii) promoting the investment opportunity in blog posts, tweets and interviews, and (iii) making them available for sale on Terraform-controlled websites or through crypto asset trading platforms.  For example, when a user navigated to the website with the domain name http://terra.mirror.finance/trade#buy, a website controlled by Terraform that was accessible to U.S. investors, the potential investor could choose to create, trade, or buy mAssets that mimicked the price of U.S. equity securities: 

image::media/ch03_kwonzi_05.jpg[] 
  
[start=116]
. Terraform created, offered, sold, and effected transactions in mAssets through the Mirror Protocol to persons who were not eligible contract participants, and Defendants made no effort to determine whether potential or actual investors were eligible contract participants.
. No registration statement has been filed or was in effect with respect to any of the offers and sales of crypto asset securities described above.  No exemption was available from registration under the Securities Act for any crypto asset securities offered or sold by Defendants.

[upperroman, start=4]
. *Terraform and Kwon Misled, Deceived, and Defrauded Investors*

[start=118]
. To inspire confidence in the Terraform ecosystem, and encourage trading in its crypto asset securities, Defendants engaged in a scheme to deceive and mislead investors and prospective investors in the U.S. and abroad.  In particular, from at least mid-2019 through at least March 2022, Defendants misled investors and prospective investors into believing that the Terraform blockchain was being used to process and settle real world purchases by retail consumers in Korea.  In addition, when UST de-pegged briefly from the U.S. dollar in May 2021, Defendants falsely represented that the peg was restored due to the success of UST’s algorithm, which, according to Terraform, was the “lynchpin of the entire [Terraform] ecosystem.”  Defendants misleadingly omitted the real reason for the re-peg – the deliberate intervention by a third party, as discussed with Defendants, to buy large amounts of UST to restore its value.   
. Defendants’ statements were materially false and misleading and made during a time when Defendants were actively offering, selling, and/or marketing Terraform’s crypto assets, including LUNA and UST.  Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that these representations were false when they were made. 
. As one Terraform employee stated in a chat with another employee on September 1, 2021, “working at terra has reinforced my belief in conspiracy theories . . . just the white lies to prop up anchor and mirror and the illusion of decentralization and true extent of chai adoption . . . all from the armchair of a single man sipping whisky” – the reference to a man sipping whisky being Kwon. 

[upperalpha, start=1]
.. *Terraform and Kwon Deceived Investors About Chai*

[start=121]
. Terraform and Kwon marketed the Terraform blockchain as having a real-world use.  Specifically, Terraform and Kwon repeatedly claimed that a Korean company, Chai Corporation (“Chai”), used the Terraform blockchain to process and settle millions of transactions for Korean consumers at retail establishments, such as online stores, movie theaters,and convenience stores.  These statements were materially false and misleading.  Chai transactions were neither processed nor settled on the Terraform blockchain.   
. To further deceive investors, Terraform and Kwon recorded completed Chai transactions onto the Terraform blockchain to make it appear as if they were processed on the blockchain when, in fact, they were not.  The purported “real-world use” of the Terraform blockchain was a literal fabrication. 
. Chai is a mobile payment service provider in Korea, similar to PayPal or Venmo, which Kwon launched, together with Terraform’s co-founder, in or around June 2019.   
. Until early 2020, Chai and Terraform were closely associated with each other, sharing an office space and overlapping personnel.  During that time, Kwon sat on Chai’s board of directors and was kept up to date on Chai activities.   
. Sometime in early 2020, Kwon and Terraform’s co-founder took steps to separate Terraform’s business from Chai.  Kwon took control of Terraform and moved its offices to a new location.  At the same time, the majority of Terraform’s employees began working solely for Terraform.  However, until approximately May 2022, Kwon continued to sit on Chai’s board and Defendants continued to represent publicly that Terraform was connected to Chai. 
. From mid-2019 through at least March 2022, Defendants made numerous and repeated statements falsely representing that the “backend” of Chai transactions were being processed and settled using the Terraform blockchain.  Terraform and Kwon also falsely stated that Chai’s use of the Terraform blockchain provided incentives to both Korean merchants and consumers to use Chai for their transactions.  Specifically, Terraform and Kwon claimed that Chai’s use of the Terraform blockchain meant that merchants experienced faster processing times and lower transaction fees through Chai than through competitor mobile payment services providers.  Likewise, Terraform and Kwon maintained that Chai customers would benefit from additional consumer discounts flowing from the lower costs associated with Chai’s purported use of the Terraform blockchain.  With these misrepresentations, Terraform and Kwon misleadingly used Chai’s growth as a proxy for the growth and success of the Terraform ecosystem as a whole. 
. Terraform and Kwon made these false and misleading statements in presentations to solicit investments in Terraform’s crypto asset securities, including LUNA, from investors and prospective investors in the U.S. and overseas.  In addition, Terraform made and disseminated these false and misleading statements in public interviews, Terraform-sponsored podcasts, and social media posts, which were available to U.S. investors and prospective investors.   
. For instance, in a presentation aired on CNBC Africa that Terraform made available to U.S. investors when it posted it to YouTube on October 14, 2019, Kwon discussed Chai in depth, explaining:   
[none]
... [I]n the backend, it uses Terra’s blockchain technology to solve some major pain points and problems for the merchants. +
 &period; &period; &period; +
But in the backend is where the real magic starts to happen. And I contend that Terra solves two of the biggest roadblocks to the adoption of digital payments in Asia and the rest of the world.  So the first is slow settlement periods. +
 &period; &period; &period; +
Terra settles in six seconds.  So every block for every transaction that has been made, we batch it up and then send it to the merchant so they can have easy and early access to working capital should they choose to do so.  The second problem that we solve is high transaction fees. +
 &period; &period; &period; +
So in the thirteen weeks in which we have been operational, early response has been quite explosive.  Up - up to today we have had 430,000 shoppers over the Chai gateway, and most of them coming in the last month. And we’ve processed nearly 2,000,000 transactions up to date.  And we think that this number will continue to grow.  In terms of daily active users, Terra and Chai has already surpassed some of the most popular tokens.  Our daily active user numbers today currently stand at around 58,000 users. . . +
 &period; &period; &period; +
So, basically what we are going for is to facilitate everyday retail transactions that are powered by Terra. 

[start=129]
. In an email sent on February 6, 2020 directly to investors, including U.S.-based institutional investors, Kwon noted that “Chai sits at 1.18 million active accounts today, and we passed the 1M mark on Jan 14th.”  Similarly, on February 9, 2020, Kwon wrote in the Terra General Discord Channel chat accessible to the public that “[r]ight now Chai has 12 merchants, all of whom get settled in KRT on the Terraform blockchain.” 
. Terraform provided a September 2020 investor slide deck to at least one U.S.based institutional investor, in which it touted the purported speed and efficiency of Chai in using the Terraform blockchain to process transactions.  One slide titled “Explosive adoption of payment solutions has generated Terra 16M in annualized fees” contained a chart of various crypto assets and associated that $16 million with “LUNA, Terra’s Native Token.”  Later slides in the deck also touted Chai’s success in promoting the investment opportunities of other Terraform crypto asset securities. 
. In a series of Tweets posted on May 24, 2021 through @terra_money, Terraform again emphasized Chai’s use of the Terraform blockchain and highlighted its growth, stating:  
[none]
.. 17/ As long as we create useful applications that people use on top of Terra, the strong locus of demand will always exist. 
.. 18/ And the use cases are already there. CHAI has more than 2 million active users in Korea. 
. And on March 31, 2022, in an interview posted to the public YouTube channel Blockworks Macro, Kwon again touted Chai and its use of the Terraform blockchain: 
[none]
.. So, we've launched apps like Chai in Korea. And so, the idea was that we were close to retail loop with things that people can buy, and transact with using, you know, Terra payments. So, you could take it to most e-commerce merchants of your choice. I could go to movie theaters, convenience stores, and things like that. 
. In addition to making and disseminating these materially false and misleading statements, Terraform and Kwon engaged in other deceptive acts, including by entering transactions on the Terraform blockchain using “KRT” (yet another algorithmic stablecoin offered by Terraform that was pegged to Korean currency, Won), which purported to reflect Chai commercial transactions.  Specifically, from June 2019 through at least May 12, 2022, the Terraform blockchain appeared to reflect that Chai transactions were being settled on the blockchain in KRT, when, in fact, Chai payments were processed in Korean Won. 
. To carry out this deception, Terraform programmed a server, which was referred to internally as the “LP Server,” to receive and process data about Chai transactions, and then issue instructions to the Terraform blockchain to replicate those transactions as if they had originally “settled” on the Terraform blockchain.   
. Analysis of Terraform blockchain data reflects that, in replicating the Chai transactions, Terraform used one wallet address (“Terraform Master Wallet”) to fund up to 2.7 million other wallets.  Terraform controlled each of these wallets and used them to execute batched or “multisend” transfers that would replicate multiple Chai transactions together in a single transaction, using data received by the LP Server.  Analysis of Terraform blockchain data further reflects that Terraform used the Terraform Master Wallet to begin each batch of transactions that replicated the real transactions that Chai was processing in Korean Won. 
. In statements to investors, Kwon has confirmed that the batched blockchain transactions that utilized this Terraform Master Wallet were purportedly connected to Chai (though he did not disclose that they merely replicated Chai transactions, which were not actually settled on the blockchain).  For instance, in a private Discord chat on June 22, 2019, Kwon told a small number of investors that Terraform blockchain transactions that are “multisend [are] pretty much all Chai.” 
. To further his deception, Kwon “challenged” his Twitter followers to identify purported merchant wallet addresses from these replicated blockchain transactions.  Specifically, in a February 8, 2020 tweet posted through @stablekwon, Kwon challenged his followers to identify Chai merchant wallet addresses from the blockchain, posting: 
[none]
.. Fun thought: currently @terra_money payments app Chai is linked with 12 merchants in Korea.  Can anyone guess which wallet address belongs to which merchant?  First person to respond with the correct guess and explain reasoning get 5000 $LUNA. 
. At least one of Kwon’s Twitter followers purportedly accepted the challenge and searched the Terraform blockchain to match the follower’s real-world Chai app payments with transactions recorded on the blockchain.  As a result, the follower claimed to have discovered eleven of the twelve purported merchant wallet addresses.     
. On February 9, 2020, Kwon posted a follow-up tweet falsely stating that the follower had correctly identified the Chai merchant wallets.  In fact, a blockchain analysis reveals that each identified transaction began with the Terraform Master Wallet and the purportedly identified merchant wallet addresses were controlled by Terraform. 
. These Terraform blockchain transactions purporting to represent real Chai transactions were purely sham transactions.  An analysis of the blockchain indicates that virtually all the KRT used to fund the Terraform Master Wallet originated from other Terraform-controlled wallets, including a reserve of Terraform stablecoins, called Terraform SDR (SDT).  Similarly, virtually all the KRT used to replicate these Chai transactions remained in or was returned to Terraform-controlled wallets through at least May 12, 2022.  The analysis further reflects that, from June 2019 until at least May 2022, with very few exceptions, the wallet addresses used in Terraform Master Wallet transactions were used in no other transactions other than those initiated from the Terraform Master Wallet.  In other words, these blockchain transactions do not reflect real-world, arms-length transfers of KRT between consumers and merchants.  Instead, they reflect a closed system in which Terraform transferred KRT between millions of wallets that it controlled in order to replicate millions of transactions processed through Chai to make it appear that they had been processed and settled on the Terraform blockchain. 
. In reality, Chai did not process or settle transactions on the Terraform blockchain, but instead used traditional payment methods of receiving Korean Won from its customers and paying Korean Won to participating merchants.  Neither Chai consumers nor Chai merchants were transacting in KRT.  The transactions that were executed by the LP Server on the Terraform blockchain merely recorded transactions that had already happened in the real world using Korean Won.   
. Breaks in the continuity of new blocks created on the Terraform blockchain confirm that no Chai transactions occurred on the blockchain.  The Terraform blockchain typically creates new blocks reflecting new states of the blockchain (including transactions) every six or so seconds.  However, in at least five instances between October 2021 and March 2022, there were one or more days when no transactions whatsoever were confirmed on the Terraform blockchain.  Yet, there is no evidence that the Chai payment application was not functioning during those periods.   
. Chai itself has denied in emails to its own investors that it used a blockchain to process its payments and claimed that doing so would not have been legally permitted in Korea.  
. Terraform employees that knew of the deception also knew to maintain its secrecy.  For example, one Terraform employee explained in a chat with another employee on October 9, 2021, “btw we don’t want to say stuff about LP server too much . . . it breaks the perception that chai depends on Terra . . . Basically chai doesn’t need Terra to work . . . It’s what copies chai’s transactions from their data base to create tx activity.” 
. As a founder and former director of Chai, Kwon (and through Kwon, Terraform) knew or were reckless in not knowing that Chai did not actually process or settle transactions on the Terraform blockchain.  Kwon personally wrote much of the Terraform blockchain code from its genesis through two version upgrades and was primarily responsible for Terraform’s coding and engineering strategy decisions.  At the time of Chai’s development and launch, Kwon held the most senior technical position at Terraform. 
. Kwon knew or was reckless in not knowing that the LP Server was merely replicating Chai transaction data that had not actually occurred on the Terraform blockchain because Kwon directly supervised and instructed the Terraform employees who programmed the LP Server in the first instance.  Kwon also participated in technical discussions that required an understanding of how Chai transactions were reflected on the Terraform blockchain, including that they were batched in “multisend” transactions, and demonstrated knowledge of the location of Chai-related files in Terraform’s code repositories.  Kwon further demonstrated his understanding of the Chai transaction replication process by publicly confirming Terraform blockchain wallet addresses that purportedly belonged to Chai merchants.  
. Defendants’ misleading statements and omissions, and their deceptive acts, with respect to the non-existent Chai transactions, were material to investors in Terraform’s crypto assets securities.  
. Terraform and Kwon used these material misrepresentations about Chai to encourage and solicit investments by retail and institutional investors in Terraform crypto assets, including LUNA and wLUNA.  For example, in a June 19, 2020 blog post on Terraform’s Medium website, Terraform’s Head of Ecosystem Development directly tied Chai’s purported use of the Terraform blockchain to the returns to Terraform investors, writing:  
[none]
... In this piece we’d like to go beyond the numbers to reflect on the key role that transaction fees play in determining network value and security. The fundamental driver of transaction fees in the Terra network is the broad adoption of CHAI by consumers and merchants. 
. Defendants’ efforts worked.  U.S.-based retail and institutional investors believed that Chai operated on the Terraform blockchain and found it significant in deciding to invest in Terraform crypto assets, including LUNA.  For example, on December 3, 2020, the CEO of a U.S. based institutional investor posted to Twitter: “Terra’s payment app Chai is up to 80k daily active users.  Koreans are fast adopters.  Watch this grow. $LUNA.”  On May 18, 2022, that same CEO posted a memo to Twitter purporting to explain the basis for investing in LUNA.  In the memo, the CEO highlighted as one significant factor, Chai’s use of the Terra blockchain, describing it as “crypto finding a real-world use case.” 
. Similarly, in or around November 2021, Kwon and another Terraform employee approached another U.S.-based institutional investor to solicit that investor to purchase LUNA tokens.  In pitching the LUNA investment, Terraform and Kwon told the investor that the Terraform blockchain was being used to process Chai transactions.  The investor found this fact to be significant in deciding to invest with Terraform.  This investor specifically highlighted Chai’s purported transactions on the Terraform blockchain in the investor’s internal investment memorandum in early January 2022.  On or about January 24, 2022, that investor (through a foreign subsidiary) signed an agreement to purchase $57 million in LUNA tokens. 
. From December 27, 2019, to March 10, 2022, U.S.-based institutional investors (either directly or through offshore affiliates) purchased approximately $656 million of LUNA tokens from Terraform (or a wholly-controlled subsidiary).  These institutional investors included hedge funds and venture capitalists based in California, New York, Massachusetts, Florida, and Washington D.C.  Similarly, from September 2021 through May 2022, retail investors, including investors in the U.S., purchased billions of dollars of LUNA and wLUNA on crypto asset trading platforms.   

[upperalpha, start=2]
.. *Terraform and Kwon Mislead Investors about the May 2021 De-peg*

[start=152]
. Terraform and Kwon also engaged in a scheme to mislead investors and potential investors about the stability of Terraform’s stablecoin “UST” (including as offered and sold with the Anchor Protocol) and the algorithm that purportedly pegged UST’s price to the U.S. dollar.  Specifically, in May 2021, when the value of UST became “unpegged” from the U.S. dollar, Terraform, through Kwon, secretly discussed plans with a third party, the “U.S. Trading Firm,” to buy large amounts of UST to restore its value.   
. When UST’s price went back up as a result of these efforts, Defendants falsely and misleadingly represented to the public that UST’s algorithm had successfully re-pegged UST to the dollar, giving the investing public the false and misleading impression that the re-peg had occurred without human intervention and misleadingly omitting the real reason for the re-peg:  intervention by the U.S. Trading Firm 
. Starting on or about November 2019, the U.S. Trading Firm and Terraform or its subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements (negotiated and signed by Kwon on behalf of Terraform), whereby the U.S. Trading Firm was to provide Terraform market-making services with respect to LUNA, and eventually UST, in exchange for compensation (generally by receiving LUNA at a significant discount to market prices).  These agreements generally provided for the U.S. Trading Firm to receive LUNA after achieving certain benchmarks in its trading of UST.   
. From 2019, when UST was first coded onto the Terraform blockchain, until mid-May 2021, there were no significant market disruptions to UST.   
. But on May 19, 2021, UST began to de-peg from $1.00.  On May 23, 2021, UST’s price declined sharply, dropping to nearly $0.90.  That morning and continuing throughout the day, Kwon communicated repeatedly with the U.S. Trading Firm.  In these communications, Kwon expressed concern over UST’s value and discussed with the U.S. Trading Firm how to restore UST’s peg to the dollar.   
. The U.S. Trading Firm responded by purchasing large quantities of UST throughout the day on May 23 and continuing through May 27 in an effort to restore the peg.  Ultimately, the U.S. Trading Firm made net purchases of over 62 million UST across at least two crypto asset trading platforms.  As depicted in the chart below, UST’s market price began to rise shortly after the U.S. Trading Firm’s purchases, and eventually was restored to near $1.

image::media/ch03_kwonzi_06.jpg[]

[start=158] 
. Shortly thereafter, Kwon on behalf of Terraform agreed to remove the loan agreement conditions that required the U.S. Trading Firm to achieve the requisite benchmarks in order to receive the loaned LUNA tokens.  Instead, Terraform agreed to deliver on specified dates, without conditions, specific amounts of the remaining 61,458,334 LUNA tokens to the U.S. Trading Firm under the agreements.  Under the modified terms of the agreements, the final LUNA delivery to the U.S. Trading Firm was set to occur by September 1, 2025.   
. Those modifications were subsequently reduced to writing in a July 21, 2021 agreement signed by Kwon.  Under the terms of the modified agreement, U.S. Trading Firm received LUNA tokens at $0.40 per token, even during periods when LUNA was trading at more than $90 in the secondary market.   
. The U.S. Trading Firm ultimately profited approximately $1.28 billion by selling LUNA acquired from Terraform under the terms of the 2019 and 2020 loan agreements, as modified.                
. Almost immediately upon UST’s recovery in May 2021, Terraform and Kwon began to make materially misleading statements about how UST’s peg to the dollar was restored.  Specifically, Terraform and Kwon emphasized the purported effectiveness of the algorithm underlying UST in maintaining UST pegged to the dollar – misleadingly omitting the true cause of UST’s re-peg: the deliberate intervention by the U.S. Trading Firm to restore the peg.   
. For instance, in May 23, 2021, Kwon posted a series of statements on his Twitter account @d0h0k1, including:   
[none]
.. 16/ Is $UST growth manipulated by Terraform Labs?   
Nobody who’s used mirror or anchor could believe this – but just for clarification we currently hold only ~59M $UST. 
.. Reminder that there’s currently over 2B in UST stablecoins. 
.. . . . 
.. Building pure, unbiased and decentralized money is the long game. . . 
. Similarly, on May 24, 2021, Terraform tweeted the following from @terra_money:    
[none]
.. Plagued by the cumbersome nature of stress-induced decision-making of human agents in time of market volatility, it’s why central banks are exploring CBDCs.  Algorithmic, calibrated adjustments of economic parameters are more effective than faxes and suits in meetings. 
. Kwon continued to make similar material misstatements over the course of the next year.  For instance, during a March 1, 2022 Twitter talk show, Kwon talked about UST’s de-peg in May 2021, stating:   
[none]
.. … it took a few days for the slippage cost to naturally heal back to spot. So that’s another feature of the market module where when the exchange rate has deviated from the peg, the protocol automatically self-heals the exchange rate back to whatever the spot price is being quoted by the oracle.  So that’s why it took several days for the peg to recover. 

[none]
. A transcript of that talk show was also posted to a publicly available website located at terraspaces.org, which was funded by Kwon. 

[start=165]
. These statements were materially false and misleading.  Despite Defendants’ statements to the contrary, UST did not “automatically self-heal[].”  UST’s  “[a]lgorithmic, calibrated adjustments of economic parameters” failed.  UST’s peg to the dollar was not restored until after Defendants took deliberate steps to discuss with the U.S. Trading Firm a plan to deploy capital to restore UST’s price to one dollar.  While Defendants led investors to believe UST’s peg was restored by the algorithm, in fact, as Defendants knew, it was the deliberate actions of “human agents,” including Terraform, Kwon, and the U.S. Trading Firm, that ultimately led to the restoration of the peg. 
. And Terraform and Kwon knew or were reckless in not knowing that these statements were materially false and misleading.  Terraform and Kwon knew that the U.S. Trading Firm had intervened to buy up UST because Terraform and Kwon discussed it with the U.S. Trading Firm at the time.  In fact, the U.S. Trading Firm was rewarded for its role in restoring the peg by having the terms of its loan agreements modified to the U.S. Trading Firm’s benefit.   
. Defendants never disclosed their or U.S. Trading Firm’s roles in restoring UST’s peg.  Instead, they misled investors who were actively buying and trading UST to believe that the algorithm had “self-heal[ed]” to restore the peg without any human involvement. 
. Terraform and Kwon’s misrepresentations and omissions about the May 2021 depeg were material to numerous U.S.-based retail and institutional investors who were unaware that any third party had intervened to restore the peg and continued to buy and hold UST (including as offered and sold with Anchor Protocol) on the belief that the algorithm had worked to restore the peg.

[upperalpha, start=3]
.. *May 2022 Collapse of the Terraform Ecosystem*

[start=169]
. In May 2022, UST de-pegged from the U.S. dollar again.  This time UST’s price did not recover.  Several factors contributed to the crash, including the sale of large amounts of UST by one or more sophisticated trading firms beginning on or about May 7, 2022.  The algorithm failed to maintain the peg for UST, and its price fell to near zero, as did the prices of Terraform’s other crypto assets.   
. By the end of May 2022, UST, LUNA, wLUNA and MIR were essentially worthless, wiping out more than $40 billion in combined market value. 
. Domestic institutional investors experienced billions of dollars in losses in market valuations.  Countless retail investors lost their life savings and ended up in debt as a result of the collapse.  For example, a pharmacist in California borrowed $400,000 against the value of his home to purchase UST and lost his entire investment.  A painter in Vermont invested $20,000 in UST set aside for his son’s college education, but lost it all when the Terraform ecosystem collapsed.   
. Defendants still retain valuable proceeds from the Terraform ecosystem.  Specifically, Defendants transferred over 10,000 Bitcoin from Terraform and Luna Foundation Guard crypto asset platform accounts to an un-hosted wallet, or “cold” wallet (i.e., a self-custody wallet that is not on any exchange).  On a periodic basis since May 2022, Terraform and Kwon have transferred – and continue to transfer – Bitcoin from this wallet to a financial institution based in Switzerland and have converted the Bitcoin to cash.  Between June 2022 and the date of this complaint, over $100 million in fiat currency has been withdrawn from that Swiss bank.

[1] As used in this complaint, “crypto asset security” refers to an asset that is issued and/or transferred using distributed ledger or blockchain technology – including, but not limited to, socalled “digital assets,” “virtual currencies,” “coins,” and “tokens” – and that meets the definition of “security” under the federal securities laws.  “Security” includes any “investment contract,” “security-based swap,” or “receipt for” a security. 
[[sec_kwonzi_footnote_2]]
[2] “Governance tokens” are tokens that can, among other features, purportedly give their holders voting power over the development and structure of the protocol or blockchain, including the right to propose changes
[[sec_kwonzi_footnote_3]]
[3] Another Terraform employee agreed in an internal communication:  “Luna receives value from Terra [stablecoin] as Terra [stablecoin] is transacted.  In a way, investing in Luna is a bet that Terra’s economy will grow larger over time. Investors buy into Luna, not Terra.”

=== Discussion Questions ===
. The failure of Luna and Terraform is another famous example of cryptocurrency fraud.  Do you think the SEC would have prosecuted Kwon if Luna hadn't failed?
