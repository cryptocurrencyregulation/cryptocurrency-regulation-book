<p>Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system</p>
</div>
<div id="bitcoin_whitepaper_section1" class="paragraph">
<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.</p>
</div>
<div id="bitcoin_whitepaper_section2" class="paragraph">
<p><strong>2. Transactions </strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership.</p>
</div>
<div id="bitcoin_whitepaper_image01" class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="media/ch01-img01.png" alt="Transactions" width="60%"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The problem of course is the payee can&#8217;t verify that one of the owners did not double-spend the coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending. After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent. The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier transactions. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don&#8217;t care about later attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions. In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly announced , and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received.</p>
</div>
<div id="bitcoin_whitepaper_section3" class="paragraph">
<p><strong>3. Timestamp Server </strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server. A timestamp server works by taking a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a newspaper or Usenet post. The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the time, obviously, in order to get into the hash. Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.</p>
</div>
<div id="bitcoin_whitepaper_image02" class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="media/ch01-img02.png" alt="Timestamps" width="60%"/>
</div>
</div>
<div id="bitcoin_whitepaper_section4" class="paragraph">
<p><strong>4. Proof-of-Work </strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof-of-work system similar to Adam Back&#8217;s Hashcash, rather than newspaper or Usenet posts. The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the block until a value is found that gives the block&#8217;s hash the required zero bits. Once the CPU effort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed without redoing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block would include redoing all the blocks after it.</p>
</div>
<div id="bitcoin_whitepaper_image03" class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="media/ch01-img03.png" alt="Proof-of-Work" width="60%"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they&#8217;re generated too fast, the difficulty increases.</p>
</div>
<div id="bitcoin_whitepaper_section5" class="paragraph">
<p><strong>5. Network </strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The steps to run the network are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric">
<ol class="numeric">
<li>
<p>New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each node collects new transactions into a block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received, but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proof-of-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other branch will then switch to the longer one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes. As long as they reach many nodes, they will get into a block before long. Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped messages. If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and realizes it missed one.</p>
</div>
<div id="bitcoin_whitepaper_section6" class="paragraph">
<p><strong>6. Incentive </strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them. The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.</p>

<p><strong>9. Combining and Splitting Value </strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Although it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a separate transaction for every cent in a transfer. To allow value to be split and combined, transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs. Normally there will be either a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two outputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender.</p>

<img src="media/ch01-img04.png" alt="Combining and Splitting Value" width="30%"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>It should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those transactions depend on many more, is not a problem here. There is never the need to extract a complete standalone copy of a transaction&#8217;s history</p>
</div>
<div id="bitcoin_whitepaper_section10" class="paragraph">
<p><strong>10. Privacy </strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the "tape", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.</p>
</div>
<div id="bitcoin_whitepaper_image5" class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="media/ch01-img05.png" alt="Privacy Model" width="75%"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.</p>

<li>
<p>After reading this paper, you may have technical issues to consider.  For example, why is trust an issue? Is Bitcoin truly trustless? Why can&#8217;t Eastern Standard Time be used as a Timestamp? Do you think proof-of-work varying difficulty is fair for all participating nodes? How do malicious nodes affect the overall network? Can a malicious node claim a proof-of-work completed by another node? Are there any disincentives in bitcoin? Is Bitcoin anonymous or can transactions be traced?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may also have legal issues to consider.  Is it legal to create your own currency under U.S. Law?  Does it matter whether Bitcoin was created in the U.S. or not?   Who owns Bitcoin?  What does it mean to say that you own Bitcoin in a wallet?  If you receive Bitcoin in a wallet, is it taxable income that you have to report on your tax return?</p>

<p>Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudoynm.  We don&#8217;t know the real name(s) of the man, woman, or group of people behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.  There are various people who have been suspected of secretly being Satoshi Nakamoto.  There are also people who have claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, although none of the claimants have offered convincing proof that they are in fact Satoshi Nakamoto.  The most famous claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto was made by Craig Wright.  The below case is one of several cases that arose because of Craig Wright&#8217;s claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>

<p><strong>MR JUSTICE CHAMBERLAIN:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>In 2008, a “white paper” entitled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was published under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto (“Satoshi”). It is widely believed that the author or authors went on to invent Bitcoin, releasing early versions of the software and modifying the source code until 2010, and that this person or these persons still own a significant quantity of early Bitcoin, currently worth many billions of US dollars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There has been much speculation about the identity of Satoshi. Various individuals or groups have been proposed. One of these is the Claimant, Dr Craig Wright, a computer scientist and businessman active in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sphere who also aspires to an academic career in more than one field. Dr Wright now avows the claim that he is Satoshi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Together with Calvin Ayre, a Canadian businessman based in Antigua, Dr Wright promotes “Bitcoin Satoshi Vision” or “BSV”, which he says reflects Bitcoin’s founding purpose and values. In his oral evidence, Dr Wright referred to Calvin Ayre as his “mentor”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The defendant, Peter McCormack, is a podcaster and blogger specialising in content about Bitcoin and associated cryptocurrencies. He publishes podcasts and blogs on his website “What Bitcoin Did”. He is also a prolific user of Twitter and, from August 2017, tweeted using the handle @PeterMcCormack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Between 29 March and 29 August 2019, Mr McCormack published a series of tweets (“Publications 1-10 and 12-15”). There is no longer any complaint about Publication 11. I
set out the tweets below, but it is now common ground that their meaning is that Dr Wright is not Satoshi and his claims to be Satoshi are fraudulent. Mr McCormack made similar
claims in a video discussion hosted by an individual known as Hotep Jesus and broadcast on 18 October 2019 on YouTube, where it remains accessible (“Publication 16”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On 17 April 2019, Dr Wright issued this claim for libel in respect of the publications which had occurred by that time. The claim was amended to include the later publications. Initially, Mr McCormack pleaded a defence of truth. However, in late 2020, he abandoned that defence, saying that, otherwise, the trial would take about three weeks and he could not afford to pay for legal representation for such a trial. Accordingly, the identity of Satoshi is
not among the issues I have to determine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only issues remaining concern:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>the meaning of Publication 16;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>liability for republication of Publication 16;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether each of the Publications caused, or was likely to cause, “serious harm to the reputation of the claimant” within the meaning of s. 1(1) of the Defamation Act 2013; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if liability in respect of one or more of the Publications is established, relief.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The Publications and their context</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="8">
<li>
<p>I set out below the publications forming the subject matter of this claim, in context. The words complained of are underlined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On 29 March 2019, there were two tweets from Calvin Ayre:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">“yup… Dr Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto…and #BSV is the only real #Bitcoin. All others are attacking Craig to sell their dysfunctional snake oil crypto products. Craig has proven this to me directly in a number of ways.”<br/>
<br/>
“Craig has started filing lawsuit against those falsely denying he is Satoshi…they can all have a day in court to try to prove their fake case but the judge will rule that Craig invented Bitcoin because he did and he can prove it.”</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr McCormack replied at 8.17pm in these terms (Publication 1):<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify"><span class="underline">“Can I go first?<br/>
<br/>
Craig Wright is not Satoshi<br/>

</li>
<li>
<p>On 9 April 2019 Calvin Ayre tweeted a photograph of himself, Dr Wright and five others standing behind a conference table in what appears to be a lawyer’s office. Mr Ayre has one arm around Dr Wright’s shoulder and is giving a “thumb’s up” sign with the other hand. The others pictured include Adam Wolanski QC, Dr Wright’s leading counsel in these proceedings. The text accompanying the photograph is:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">“Craig and I are polishing our muskets at today’s Troll Hunting meeting in London. #CraigisSatoshi.”</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr McCormack responded at 1.47pm on 10 April 2019 (Publication 2):<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify"><span class="underline">“Craig Wright is not Satohis! [sic]<br/>
When do I get sued?”</span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At 10.23pm on 10 April 2019, Mr McCormack tweeted (Publication 3):<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify"><span class="underline">“Dear @CalvinAyre,</span><br/>
<br/>
I would like to formally state that:#<br/>
<span class="underline">1. Craig Wright is not Satoshi</span><br/>
<span class="underline">2. Craig Wright is a fraud</span><br/>
<span class="underline">3. I hope as many people ReTweet this as possible</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="underline">Please send legal correspondence to [Mr McCormack’s home address]</span>”</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At 2.16pm on 12 April 2019, Mr McCormack replied to his own tweet as follows (Publication 4):<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify"><span class="underline">“@CalvinAyre mate, that is over 1k RTs and 2.3k likes, I demand my lawsuit…<br/>
<br/>
…but you aren’t going to do it are you? You are just trying to bully people into silence with empty threats.<br/>
<br/>
Craig Wright is a fraud, bring it or go jogging.”</span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By 12 April 2019, Mr McCormack had received a letter from Dr Wright’s solicitors complaining about his tweets and asking him to delete the tweets, undertake not to repeat the claims and apologise publicly. His response was to post a copy of the letter with a series of tweets, the first of which was at 5.04pm. These were as follows (Publication 5):<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify"><span class="underline">“1/ So I got my letter from Craig Wright and @CalvinAyre. This is what they are sending out to people, now you can all see.<br/>
<br/>
I absolutely reject their requirements.<br/>
<br/>
(PS I don’t recommend anyone else does this).”<br/>
<br/>
“2/ I believe that claiming to be Satoshi and promoting a fake version of Bitcoin is fraudulent. I believe this is in the public interest.<br/>
<br/>
Let’s go to court.”<br/>
<br/>
“Before any claims of virtue signalling or clout…I’m doing this because it is the right thing to do. I’ve lost everything before and if I lose again, so what. BSV is a fake Bitcoin run by frauds.<br/>
<br/>
F**k them!”</span></span></p>

<ol class="arabic" start="50">
<li>
<p>On 29 November 2019, Dr Wright served further revised draft Amended Particulars of Claim, in the same form as ultimately served on 19 December 2019. This altered the
Claimant’s case on serious harm, abandoning the contentions relating to Dr Wright’s relationships with individuals at Leicester University, SOAS and CNAM. The fact that he
no longer picked his children up from school was now pleaded as a particular of distress, but not of serious harm. The averment that he had been deterred from undertaking work with public bodies and applying for roles in public life was replaced with a more limited averment that the publications had made it more difficult for him to achieve his ambition of becoming a magistrate in Surrey. The claim in relation to serious harm to reputation in EU states was abandoned; the harm pleaded was now confined to that said to have been suffered in England and Wales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr Wright’s new case was that, in the period between 1 January and 31 March 2019, he had been invited to speak and present academic papers at eight academic conferences and that:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">“25.9.2 Prior to publication of the words complained of, the Claimant had been invited to speak at numerous further such conferences. In several instances those invitations followed the successful submission by the Claimant of proposed academic papers for blind peer review. However following publication of the words complained of, invitations to the Claimant were withdrawn by the following conferences:</span><br/>
<span class="quoteblock  quoteblock  text-justify">25.9.2.1. The Twenty-sixth International Conference on Telecoms, held in Hanoi, Vietnam on 8 to 10 April 2019; <br/>
25.9.2.2. The IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications, held in Paris, France on 29 April to 2 May 2019;<br/>
25.9.2.3. The Forty-first ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering, held in Montreal, Canada on 25 to 31 May 2019;<br/>
25.9.2.4. The Sixth International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications, held in Istanbul, Turkey on 18 to 20 June 2019;<br/>
25.9.2.5. The Twenty-second International Conference on Business Information Systems, held in Seville, Spain, on 26 to 28 June 2019;<br/>
25.9.2.6. The Forty-second International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing, held in Budapest, Hungary on 1 to 3 July 2019;<br/>
25.9.2.7. The Second Vietnam Symposium in Leadership and Public Policy, held in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam on 28 to 29 October 2019;<br/>
25.9.2.8. The Twenty-fifth Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications, held in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam on 6 to 8 November 2019;<br/>
25.9.2.9. CHAINSIGHTS Fintech and Blockchain Summit,held in New York City, USA on 10 October 2019; and<br/>
25.9.2.10. MoneyConf,  held in Lisbon, Portugal on 5 to 7 November 2019. </span><br/>
<span class="quoteblock1  text-justify">25.9.3. Given the timings of these exclusions it is to be inferred that the primary cause of these exclusions was publication of the words complained of.<br/>
25.9.4. As a result of the exclusion of the Claimant from the conferences set out at paragraphs<br/>
25.9.2.1 to 25.9.2.8 the academic papers which the Claimant had been due to present were not presented at those conferences and, as a result, the Claimant has been unable to publish them to the world at large. The inability of the Claimant to present and publish those papers has led to considerable difficulties for the Claimant in pursuing academic opportunities. The Claimant wishes to develop an academic career in England (having previously taught as an Adjunct Lecturer in the Faculty of Business, School of Computing and Mathematics at Charles Sturt University, Australia) but needs to demonstrate the recent publication of academic papers to obtain such positions.<br/>
25.9.5. Further, the inability of the Claimant to publish academic papers has a detrimental impact upon the value of the patents which the Claimant files and creates. The publication of academic papers assists in the promotion of patents: a patent which has a published academic paper behind it can be worth many times as much as a patent which does not.” </span></p>

<li>
<p>Dr Wright now accepts that his evidence (though not his pleading) was wrong, but says that this was inadvertent. In assessing this, it is necessary to set out what the evidence now shows and the extent to which this diverges from the case originally advanced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is <span class="underline">no</span> documentary evidence that: (i) Dr Wright had a paper accepted following a blind peer review process at <span class="underline">any</span> of the academic conferences identified in para. 25.9.2 of the ReAmended Particulars of Claim; or (ii) Dr Wright ever received an invitation to speak at <span class="underline">any</span> of those conferences, with the possible exception of Seville; or (iii) that any such invitation was rescinded. I have borne in mind Dr Wright’s evidence that he no longer has access to the emails sent to his CNAM account, but even if that account is true, emails are often retained by the sender as well as the recipient. It is striking that, with the assistance of his very well-resourced lawyers, he has been unable to locate any documentary evidence to support his account that invitations were made and then rescinded: see, in this regard, <em>Wetton (as Liquidator of Mumtaz Properties Ltd) v Ahmed</em> [2011] EWCA Civ 61, [14] (Arden LJ).</p>

<li>
<p>A conclusion that a witness has given deliberately false evidence should not be drawn lightly. There are times, however, when the application of Occam’s razor impels such a conclusion. In this case, there is no other plausible explanation. I reach that view having observed Dr Wright give oral evidence and on the basis of a combination of: (i) the circumstances in which the case on serious harm was pleaded; (ii) the extent to which that case – and the evidence contained in the first witness statement – were subsequently shown to be false; (iii) the timing of Dr Wright’s third witness statement (in response to the new evidence exposing the falsity of his earlier case); (iv) the vague and unimpressive oral evidence given by Dr Wright in support of his new case at trial; and (v) the lack of any adequate or convincing explanation for the falsity of the original case and evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I therefore conclude that Dr Wright’s original case on serious harm, and the evidence supporting it, both of which were maintained until days before trial, were deliberately false.</p>

<p><strong>Relief</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="141">
<li>
<p>By way of relief, Dr Wright claims damages, an injunction and an order for publication of a summary of the judgment pursuant to s. 12 of the 2013 Act. There has been correspondence in which Mr McCormack’s solicitors have offered undertakings in the event of a finding against Mr McCormack on liability. In my judgment, the appropriate way to proceed is for me to resolve the question of damages first and then invite further submissions as to whether any injunctive or other relief should be granted in the light of my findings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general approach to the assessment of damages for defamation cases was set out by Warby J in <em>Monroe v Hopkins</em> at [75]-[78]. However, it is also well established that “a person should only be compensated for injury to the reputation they actually possess” and it is accordingly open to a defendant to adduce evidence of a claimant’s bad reputation in mitigation of damages: <em>Lachaux</em>, [74] (Warby J). In assessing the proper level of damages or in mitigation of damages, the court can take into account evidence admitted on another issue: Gatley on Libel and Slander (13th ed., 2022), §34-096; <em>Dhir v Saddler</em> [2017] EWHC 3155 (QB), [2018] 4 WLR 1, [118]; <em>Bokova v Associated Newspapers Ltd</em> [2018] EWHC 2032 (QB), [2019] QB 861, [29].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a libel action brought by an individual, compensation is awarded for injury to reputation (objectively assessed) and for injury to feelings. Had it not been for Dr Wright’s deliberately false case as to serious harm, a more than minimal award of damages would have been appropriate, though the quantum would have been reduced to reflect the fact that Mr McCormack was goaded into making the statements he did and, having found Dr Wright not to be a witness of truth, I would have rejected in its entirety his case as to the distress he claims to have suffered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But the deliberately false case on serious harm advanced by Dr Wright until days before trial in my judgment requires more than a mere reduction in the award of damages. In my judgment, it makes it unconscionable that Dr Wright should receive any more than nominal damages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <em>Joseph v Spiller</em> [2012] EWHC 2958 (QB), a claim heard before the 2013 Act, the claimant was a member of a musical group. The defendant was one of the directors of an
entertainment bookings service. He published something defamatory of the claimant’s group on his website. The claimant advanced a claim for special damages for the cancellation of a booking, said to have been occasioned by the publication complained of. Tugendhat J held that the claimant had carried on a sophisticated deception of the court by putting forward a witness statement he knew to be false and by relying on a false document to mislead the court. As a result, although the claim succeeded, “there would be no injustice to Mr Joseph if he is awarded only nominal damages” – and that is what happened: see at [177]-[178] and [184].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <em>FlyMeNow Ltd v Quick Air Jet Charter GmbH</em> [2016] EWHC 3197 (QB), Warby J awarded damages of £10 to a company which succeeded in a claim for libel in respect of a statement by one of its creditors imputing insolvency. This very low or nominal award was justified in part by a finding that the claimant had fobbed the defendant off with a series of dishonest excuses (see [127]), but also by the finding that “a central element of its case was false from the beginning and should have been recognised as such by the company’s principal”, who had “given false evidence” (see [128]). The latter findings were “disreputable facts that are properly before the court, which logically affect the extent to which the claimant is entitled to vindication of its reputation through an award of damages”. This approach was said to be supported by <em>Joseph v Spiller</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In my judgment, the same principle applies here:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Dr Wright advanced a deliberately false case as to the disinvitations from academic conferences in his Amended Particulars of Claim and his first witness statement. That case was designed to show that the Publications had caused serious harm, which is now an essential element of the tort of defamation. It was also relevant to the quantum of damages sought. These were both central issues in the claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The case was maintained until shortly before the trial and, on my findings, would have been maintained at trial had Mr McCormack not served evidence from two of the organisers of the academic conferences from which Dr Wright said he had been disinvited after previously having had papers accepted following blind peer review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr Wright’s response to this evidence was to change his case and withdraw significant parts of his earlier evidence, while seeking to explain that the errors were inadvertent. I have rejected that explanation as untrue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have found that the Publications <span class="underline">did</span> cause serious harm without reference to the earlier deliberately false case as to the academic conferences. However, I am entitled to take into account my findings as to the earlier false case in assessing damages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As in <em>Joseph v Spiller</em>, I find that there would be no injustice if Dr Wright were to recover only nominal damages.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the light of this conclusion, it is not necessary to resolve the differences between the parties as to the extent of publication; and it would not be a proportionate use of judicial resources to do so.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="149">
<li>
<p>For these reasons, I conclude that:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Publication 16 meant that there were reasonable grounds for questioning or inquiring as to whether the Claimant had fraudulently claimed to be Satoshi. This was defamatory at common law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr McCormack is responsible for the re-publication of Publication 16 by the posting of the recording on YouTube.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each of Publications 1-10 and 12-16 caused serious harm to the reputation of Dr Wright.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, because he advanced a deliberately false case and put forward deliberately false evidence until days before trial, he will recover only nominal damages.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accordingly, I shall enter judgment for Dr Wright on the claim in the sum of £1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I shall invite written submissions in the light of this judgment on the question of injunctive or other relief and on costs.</p>

<p><strong>Report of Investigation Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist upperroman">
<ol class="upperroman" type="I" start="1">
<li>
<p><strong>Introduction and Summary</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“Commission”) Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has investigated whether The DAO, an unincorporated organization; Slock.it UG (“Slock.it”), a German corporation; Slock.it’s co-founders; and intermediaries may have violated the federal securities laws. The Commission has determined not to pursue an enforcement action in this matter based on the conduct and activities known to the Commission
at this time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>As described more fully below, The DAO is one example of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, which is a term used to describe a “virtual” organization embodied in computer code and executed on a distributed ledger or blockchain. The DAO was created by Slock.it and Slock.it’s co-founders, with the objective of operating as a for-profit entity that
would create and hold a corpus of assets through the sale of DAO Tokens to investors, which assets would then be used to fund “projects.” The holders of DAO Tokens stood to share in the anticipated earnings from these projects as a return on their investment in DAO Tokens. In addition, DAO Token holders could monetize their investments in DAO Tokens by re-selling DAO Tokens on a number of web-based platforms (“Platforms”) that supported secondary trading in the DAO Tokens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>After DAO Tokens were sold, but before The DAO was able to commence funding projects, an attacker used a flaw in The DAO’s code to steal approximately one-third of The DAO’s assets. Slock.it’s co-founders and others responded by creating a work-around whereby DAO Token holders could opt to have their investment returned to them, as described in more detail below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The investigation raised questions regarding the application of the U.S. federal securities laws to the offer and sale of DAO Tokens, including the threshold question whether DAO Tokens are securities. Based on the investigation, and under the facts presented, the Commission has determined that DAO Tokens are securities under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a> The Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to issue this report of investigation (“Report”) pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_2"><sup><strong>(2)</strong></sup></a> to advise those who would use a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (“DAO Entity”), or other distributed ledger or blockchain-enabled means for capital raising, to take appropriate steps to ensure compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws. All securities offered and sold in the United States must be registered with the Commission or must qualify for an exemption from the registration requirements. In addition, any entity or person engaging in the activities of an exchange must register as a national
securities exchange or operate pursuant to an exemption from such registration.</p>

<p>This Report reiterates these fundamental principles of the U.S. federal securities laws and describes their applicability to a new paradigm—virtual organizations or capital raising entities that use distributed ledger or blockchain technology to facilitate capital raising and/or investment and the related offer and sale of securities.

<p>From April 30, 2016 through May 28, 2016, The DAO offered and sold approximately 1.15 billion DAO Tokens in exchange for a total of approximately 12 million Ether (“ETH”), a virtual currency<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_5"><sup><strong>(5)</strong></sup></a> used on the Ethereum Blockchain.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_6"><sup><strong>(6)</strong></sup></a>  As of the time the offering closed, the total ETH raised by The DAO was valued in U.S. Dollars (“USD”) at approximately $150 million.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The concept of a DAO Entity is memorialized in a document (the “White Paper”), authored by Christoph Jentzsch, the Chief Technology Officer of Slock.it, a “Blockchain and IoT [(internet-of-things)] solution company,” incorporated in Germany and co-founded by Christoph Jentzsch, Simon Jentzsch (Christoph Jentzsch’s brother), and Stephan Tual (“Tual”). <a href="#ico_dao_footnote_7"><sup><strong>(7)</strong></sup></a> The White Paper purports to describe “the first implementation of a [DAO Entity] code to automate organizational governance and decision making.”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_8"><sup><strong>(8)</strong></sup></a> The White Paper posits that a DAO Entity “can be used by individuals working together collaboratively outside of a traditional corporate form. It can also be used by a registered corporate entity to automate formal governance rules contained in corporate bylaws or imposed by law.” The White Paper proposes an entity—a DAO Entity—that would use smart contracts to attempt to solve governance issues it described as inherent in traditional corporations.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_9"><sup><strong>(9)</strong></sup></a> As described, a DAO Entity purportedly would supplant traditional mechanisms of corporate governance and management with a blockchain such that contractual terms are “formalized, automated and enforced using software.” <a href="#ico_dao_footnote_10"><sup><strong>(10)</strong></sup></a></p>

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>“The DAO” is the “first generation” implementation of the White Paper concept of a DAO Entity, and it began as an effort to create a “crowdfunding contract” to raise “funds to grow [a] company in the crypto space.”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_11"><sup><strong>(11)</strong></sup></a> In November 2015, at an Ethereum Developer Conference in London, Christoph Jentzsch described his proposal for The DAO as a “for-profit DAO [Entity],” where participants would send ETH (a virtual currency) to The DAO to purchase DAO Tokens, which would permit the participant to vote and entitle the participant to “rewards.”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_12"><sup><strong>(12)</strong></sup></a> Christoph Jentzsch likened this to “buying shares in a company and getting … dividends.”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_13"><sup><strong>(13)</strong></sup></a> The DAO was to be “decentralized” in that it would allow for voting by investors holding DAO Tokens.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_14"><sup><strong>(14)</strong></sup></a> All funds raised were to be held at an Ethereum Blockchain “address” associated with The DAO and DAO Token holders were to vote on contract proposals, including proposals to The DAO to fund projects and distribute The DAO’s anticipated earnings from the projects it
funded. <a href="#ico_dao_footnote_15"><sup><strong>(15)</strong></sup></a> The DAO was intended to be “autonomous” in that project proposals were in the form of smart contracts that exist on the Ethereum Blockchain and the votes were administered by the code of The DAO.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_16"><sup><strong>(16)</strong></sup></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>On or about April 29, 2016, Slock.it deployed The DAO code on the Ethereum Blockchain, as a set of pre-programmed instructions. <a href="#ico_dao_footnote_17"><sup><strong>(17)</strong></sup></a> This code was to govern how The DAO was to operate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>To promote The DAO, Slock.it’s co-founders launched a website (“The DAO Website”). The DAO Website included a description of The DAO’s intended purpose: “To blaze a new path in business for the betterment of its members, existing simultaneously nowhere and everywhere and operating solely with the steadfast iron will of unstoppable code.”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_18"><sup><strong>(18)</strong></sup></a> The DAO Website also described how The DAO operated, and included a link through which DAO Tokens could be purchased. The DAO Website also included a link to the White Paper, which provided detailed information about a DAO Entity’s structure and its source code and, together with The DAO Website, served as the primary source of promotional materials for The DAO. On The DAO Website and elsewhere, Slock.it represented that The DAO’s source code had been reviewed by “one of the world’s leading security audit companies” and “no stone was left unturned during those five whole days of security analysis.”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_19"><sup><strong>(19)</strong></sup></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Slock.it’s co-founders also promoted The DAO by soliciting media attention and by
posting almost daily updates on The DAO’s status on The DAO and Slock.it websites and
numerous online forums relating to blockchain technology. Slock.it’s co-founders used these
posts to communicate to the public information about how to participate in The DAO, including:
how to create and acquire DAO Tokens; the framework for submitting proposals for projects;
and how to vote on proposals. Slock.it also created an online forum on The DAO Website, as
well as administered “The DAO Slack” channel, an online messaging platform in which over
5,000 invited “team members” could discuss and exchange ideas about The DAO in real time.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In exchange for ETH, The DAO created DAO Tokens (proportional to the amount of ETH paid) that were then assigned to the Ethereum Blockchain address of the person or entity remitting the ETH. A DAO Token granted the DAO Token holder certain voting and ownership rights. According to promotional materials, The DAO would earn profits by funding projects that would provide DAO Token holders a return on investment. The various promotional materials disseminated by Slock.it’s co-founders touted that DAO Token holders would receive “rewards,” which the White Paper defined as, “any [ETH] received by a DAO [Entity] generated from projects the DAO [Entity] funded.” DAO Token holders would then vote to either use the rewards to fund new projects or to distribute the ETH to DAO Token holders.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>From April 30, 2016 through May 28, 2016 (the “Offering Period”), The DAO offered and sold DAO Tokens. Investments in The DAO were made “pseudonymously” (i.e., an individual’s or entity’s pseudonym was their Ethereum Blockchain address). To purchase a DAO Token offered for sale by The DAO, an individual or entity sent ETH from their Ethereum Blockchain address to an Ethereum Blockchain address associated with The DAO. All of the ETH raised in the offering as well as any future profits earned by The DAO were to be pooled and held in The DAO’s Ethereum Blockchain address. The token price fluctuated in a range of approximately 1 to 1.5 ETH per 100 DAO Tokens, depending on when the tokens were purchased during the Offering Period.  Anyone was eligible to purchase DAO Tokens (as long as they paid ETH). There ere no limitations placed on the number of DAO Tokens offered for sale, the number of purchasers of DAO Tokens, or the level of sophistication of such purchasers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>DAO Token holders were not restricted from re-selling DAO Tokens acquired in the offering, and DAO Token holders could sell their DAO Tokens in a variety of ways in the secondary market and thereby monetize their investment as discussed below. Prior to the Offering Period, Slock.it solicited at least one U.S. web-based platform to trade DAO Tokens on
its system and, at the time of the offering, The DAO Website and other promotional materials disseminated by Slock.it included representations that DAO Tokens would be available for secondary market trading after the Offering Period via several platforms. During the Offering Period and afterwards, the Platforms posted notices on their own websites and on social media that each planned to support secondary market trading of DAO Tokens.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_20"><sup><strong>(20)</strong></sup></a>
In addition to secondary market trading on the Platforms, after the Offering Period, DAO
Tokens were to be freely transferable on the Ethereum Blockchain. DAO Token holders would
also be permitted to redeem their DAO Tokens for ETH through a complicated, multi-week
(approximately 46-day) process referred to as a DAO Entity “split.”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_21"><sup><strong>(21)</strong></sup></a></p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>According to the White Paper, in order for a project to be considered for funding with “a DAO [Entity]’s [ETH],” a “Contractor” first must submit a proposal to the DAO Entity. Specifically, DAO Token holders expected Contractors to submit proposals for projects that could provide DAO Token holders returns on their investments. Submitting a proposal to The DAO involved: (1) writing a smart contract, and then deploying and publishing it on the Ethereum Blockchain; and (2) posting details about the proposal on The DAO Website, including the Ethereum Blockchain address of the deployed contract and a link to its source code. Proposals could be viewed on The DAO Website as well as other publicly-accessible websites. Per the White Paper, there were two prerequisites for submitting a proposal. An individual or entity must: (1) own at least one DAO Token; and (2) pay a deposit in the form of ETH that would be forfeited to the DAO Entity if the proposal was put up for a vote and failed to achieve a quorum of DAO Token holders. It was publicized that Slock.it would be the first to submit a proposal for funding.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_22"><sup><strong>(22)</strong></sup></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>ETH raised by The DAO was to be distributed to a Contractor to fund a proposal only on a majority vote of DAO Token holders.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_23"><sup><strong>(23)</strong></sup></a> DAO Token holders were to cast votes, which would be weighted by the number of tokens they controlled, for or against the funding of a specific proposal. The voting process, however, was publicly criticized in that it could incentivize distorted voting behavior and, as a result, would not accurately reflect the consensus of the majority of DAO Token holders. Specifically, as noted in a May 27, 2016 blog post by a group of computer security researchers, The DAO’s structure included a “strong positive bias to vote YES on proposals and to suppress NO votes as a side effect of the way in which it restricts users’ range of options following the casting of a vote.”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_24"><sup><strong>(24)</strong></sup></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Before any proposal was put to a vote by DAO Token holders, it was required to be reviewed by one or more of The DAO’s “Curators.” At the time of the formation of The DAO, the Curators were a group of individuals chosen by Slock.it.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_25"><sup><strong>(25)</strong></sup></a> According to the White Paper, the Curators of a DAO Entity had “considerable power.” The Curators performed crucial security functions and maintained ultimate control over which proposals could be submitted to, voted on, and funded by The DAO. As stated on The DAO Website during the Offering Period, The DAO relied on its Curators for “failsafe protection” and for protecting The DAO from “malicous [sic] actors.” Specifically, per The DAO Website, a Curator was responsible for: (1) confirming that any proposal for funding originated from an identifiable person or organization; and (2) confirming that smart contracts associated with any such proposal properly reflected the code the Contractor claims to have deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain. If a Curator determined that the proposal met these criteria, the Curator could add the proposal to the “whitelist,” which was a list of Ethereum Blockchain addresses that could receive ETH from The DAO if the majority of DAO Token holders voted for the proposal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Curators of The DAO had ultimate discretion as to whether or not to submit a proposal for voting by DAO Token holders. Curators also determined the order and frequency of proposals, and could impose subjective criteria for whether the proposal should be whitelisted. One member of the group chosen by Slock.it to serve collectively as the Curator stated publicly that the Curator had “complete control over the whitelist … the order in which things get whitelisted, the duration for which [proposals] get whitelisted, when things get unwhitelisted … [and] clear ability to control the order and frequency of proposals,” noting that “curators have tremendous power.”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_26"><sup><strong>(26)</strong></sup></a> Another Curator publicly announced his subjective criteria for determining whether to whitelist a proposal, which included his personal ethics.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_27"><sup><strong>(27)</strong></sup></a> Per the White Paper, a Curator also had the power to reduce the voting quorum requirement by 50% every other week. Absent action by a Curator, the quorum could be reduced by 50% only if no proposal had reached the required quorum for 52 weeks.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>During the period from May 28, 2016 through early September 2016, the Platforms became the preferred vehicle for DAO Token holders to buy and sell DAO Tokens in the secondary market using virtual or fiat currencies. Specifically, the Platforms used electronic systems that allowed their respective customers to post orders for DAO Tokens on an anonymous basis. For example, customers of each Platform could buy or sell DAO Tokens by entering a market order on the Platform’s system, which would then match with orders from other customers residing on the system. Each Platform’s system would automatically execute these orders based on pre-programmed order interaction protocols established by the Platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>None of the Platforms received orders for DAO Tokens from non-Platform customers or routed its respective customers’ orders to any other trading destinations. The Platforms publicly displayed all their quotes, trades, and daily trading volume in DAO Tokens on their respective websites. During the period from May 28, 2016 through September 6, 2016, one such Platform executed more than 557,378 buy and sell transactions in DAO Tokens by more than 15,000 of its U.S. and foreign customers. During the period from May 28, 2016 through August 1, 2016, another such Platform executed more than 22,207 buy and sell transactions in DAO Tokens by more than 700 of its U.S. customers.</p>

<p><em>Security Concerns, The “Attack” on The DAO, and The Hard Fork</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In late May 2016, just prior to the expiration of the Offering Period, concerns about the safety and security of The DAO’s funds began to surface due to vulnerabilities in The DAO’s code. On May 26, 2016, in response to these concerns, Slock.it submitted a “DAO Security Proposal” that called for the development of certain updates to The DAO’s code and the appointment of a security expert.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_28"><sup><strong>(28)</strong></sup></a> Further, on June 3, 2016, Christoph Jentzsch, on behalf of Slock.it, proposed a moratorium on all proposals until alterations to The DAO’s code to fix vulnerabilities in The DAO’s code had been implemented.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_29"><sup><strong>(29)</strong></sup></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>On June 17, 2016, an unknown individual or group (the “Attacker”) began rapidly diverting ETH from The DAO, causing approximately 3.6 million ETH—1/3 of the total ETH raised by The DAO offering—to move from The DAO’s Ethereum Blockchain address to an Ethereum Blockchain address controlled by the Attacker (the “Attack”).<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_30"><sup><strong>(30)</strong></sup></a> Although the diverted ETH was then held in an address controlled by the Attacker, the Attacker was prevented by The DAO’s code from moving the ETH from that address for 27 days.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_31"><sup><strong>(31)</strong></sup></a>31</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In order to secure the diverted ETH and return it to DAO Token holders, Slock.it’s cofounders and others endorsed a “Hard Fork” to the Ethereum Blockchain. The “Hard Fork,” called for a change in the Ethereum protocol on a going forward basis that would restore the DAO Token holders’ investments as if the Attack had not occurred. On July 20, 2016, after a majority of the Ethereum network adopted the necessary software updates, the new, forked Ethereum Blockchain became active.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_32"><sup><strong>(32)</strong></sup></a> The Hard Fork had the effect of transferring all of the funds raised (including those held by the Attacker) from The DAO to a recovery address, where DAO Token holders could exchange their DAO Tokens for ETH.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_33"><sup><strong>(33)</strong></sup></a> All DAO Token holders who adopted the Hard Fork could exchange their DAO Tokens for ETH, and avoid any loss of the ETH they had invested.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_34"><sup><strong>(34)</strong></sup></a></p>

<p>The Commission is aware that virtual organizations and associated individuals and entities increasingly are using distributed ledger technology to offer and sell instruments such as DAO Tokens to raise capital. These offers and sales have been referred to, among other things, as “Initial Coin Offerings” or “Token Sales.” Accordingly, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to issue this Report in order to stress that the U.S. federal securities law may apply to various activities, including distributed ledger technology, depending on the particular facts and circumstances, without regard to the form of the organization or technology used to effectuate a particular offer or sale.

<p>The registration provisions of the Securities Act contemplate that the offer or sale  securities to the public must be accompanied by the “full and fair disclosure” afforded by registration with the Commission and delivery of a statutory prospectus containing information necessary to enable prospective purchasers to make an informed investment decision. Registration entails disclosure of detailed “information about the issuer’s financial condition, the identity and background of management, and the price and amount of securities to be offered … .” SEC v. Cavanagh, 1 F. Supp. 2d 337, 360 (S.D.N.Y. 1998), aff’d, 155 F.3d 129 (2d Cir. 1998). “The registration statement is designed to assure public access to material facts bearing on the value of publicly traded securities and is central to the Act’s comprehensive scheme for protecting public investors.” SEC v. Aaron, 605 F.2d 612, 618 (2d Cir. 1979) (citing SEC v. Ralston Purina Co., 346 U.S. 119, 124 (1953)), vacated on other grounds, 446 U.S. 680 (1980). Section 5(a) of the Securities Act provides that, unless a registration statement is in effect as to a security, it is unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to engage in the offer or sale of securities in interstate commerce. Section 5(c) of the Securities Act provides a similar prohibition against offers to sell, or offers to buy, unless a registration statement has been filed. Thus, both Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act prohibit the unregistered offer or sale of securities in interstate commerce. 15 U.S.C. § 77e(a) and (c).

<p>Under Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act, a security includes “an investment contract.” See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77b-77c. An investment contract is an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. See SEC v. Edwards, 540 U.S. 389, 393 (2004); SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 301 (1946); see also United Housing Found., Inc. v. Forman, 421 U.S. 837, 852-53 (1975) (The “touchstone” of an investment contract “is the presence of an investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.”). This definition embodies a “flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.” Howey, 328 U.S. at 299 (emphasis added). The test “permits the fulfillment of the statutory purpose of compelling full and fair disclosure relative to the issuance of ‘the many types of instruments that in our commercial world fall within the ordinary concept of a security.’” Id. In analyzing whether something is a security, “form should be disregarded for substance,” Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967), “and the emphasis should be on economic realities underlying a transaction, and not on the name appended thereto.” United Housing Found., 421 U.S. at 849.</p>

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Investors in The DAO used ETH to make their investments, and DAO Tokens were received in exchange for ETH.

As described above, the various promotional materials disseminated by Slock.it and its cofounders informed investors that The DAO was a for-profit entity whose objective was to fund projects in exchange for a return on investment.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_35"><sup><strong>(35)</strong></sup></a> The ETH was pooled and available to The DAO to fund projects. The projects (or “contracts”) would be proposed by Contractors. If the proposed contracts were whitelisted by Curators, DAO Token holders could vote on whether The DAO should fund the proposed contracts. Depending on the terms of each particular contract, DAO Token holders stood to share in potential profits from the contracts.

</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Investors’ profits were to be derived from the managerial efforts of others—specifically, Slock.it and its co-founders, and The DAO’s Curators. The central issue is “whether the efforts made by those other than the investor are the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise.” SEC v. Glenn W. Turner Enters., Inc., 474 F.2d 476, 482 (9th Cir. 1973). The DAO’s investors relied on the managerial and entrepreneurial efforts of Slock.it and its co-founders, and The DAO’s Curators, to manage The DAO and put forth project proposals that could generate profits for The DAO’s investors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Investors’ expectations were primed by the marketing of The DAO and active engagement between Slock.it and its co-founders with The DAO and DAO Token holders. To market The DAO and DAO Tokens, Slock.it created The DAO Website on which it published the White Paper explaining how a DAO Entity would work and describing their vision for a DAO Entity. Slock.it also created and maintained other online forums that it used to provide information to DAO Token holders about how to vote and perform other tasks related to their investment. Slock.it appears to have closely monitored these forums, answering questions from DAO Token holders about a variety of topics, including the future of The DAO, security concerns, ground rules for how The DAO would work, and the anticipated role of DAO Token holders. The creators of The DAO held themselves out to investors as experts in Ethereum, the blockchain protocol on which The DAO operated, and told investors that they had selected persons to serve as Curators based on their expertise and credentials. Additionally, Slock.it told investors that it expected to put forth the first substantive profit-making contract proposal—a blockchain venture in its area of expertise. Through their conduct and marketing materials, Slock.it and its co-founders led investors to believe that they could be relied on to provide the significant managerial efforts required to make The DAO a success.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Investors in The DAO reasonably expected Slock.it and its co-founders, and The DAO’s Curators, to provide significant managerial efforts after The DAO’s launch. The expertise of The DAO’s creators and Curators was critical in monitoring the operation of The DAO, safeguarding investor funds, and determining whether proposed contracts should be put for a vote. Investors had little choice but to rely on their expertise. At the time of the offering, The DAO’s protocols had already been pre-determined by Slock.it and its co-founders, including the control that could be exercised by the Curators. Slock.it and its co-founders chose the Curators, whose function it was to: (1) vet Contractors; (2) determine whether and when to submit proposals for votes; (3) determine the order and frequency of proposals that were submitted for a vote; and (4) determine whether to halve the default quorum necessary for a successful vote on certain proposals. Thus, the Curators exercised significant control over the order and frequency of proposals, and could impose their own subjective criteria for whether the proposal should be whitelisted for a vote by DAO Token holders. DAO Token holders’ votes were limited to proposals whitelisted by the Curators, and, although any DAO Token holder could put forth a proposal, each proposal would follow the same protocol, which included vetting and control by the current Curators. While DAO Token holders could put forth proposals to replace a Curator, such proposals were subject to control by the current Curators, including whitelisting and approval of the new address to which the tokens would be directed for such a proposal. In essence, Curators had the power to determine whether a proposal to remove a Curator was put to a vote. <a href="#ico_dao_footnote_36"><sup><strong>(36)</strong></sup></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>And, Slock.it and its co-founders did, in fact, actively oversee The DAO. They monitored The DAO closely and addressed issues as they arose, proposing a moratorium on all proposals until vulnerabilities in The DAO’s code had been addressed and a security expert to monitor potential attacks on The DAO had been appointed. When the Attacker exploited a weakness in the code and removed investor funds, Slock.it and its co-founders stepped in to help resolve the situation.</p>

<li>
<p>DAO Token Holders’ Voting Rights Were Limited</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Although DAO Token holders were afforded voting rights, these voting rights were limited. DAO Token holders were substantially reliant on the managerial efforts of Slock.it, its co-founders, and the Curators. <a href="#ico_dao_footnote_37"><sup><strong>(37)</strong></sup></a> Even if an investor’s efforts help to make an enterprise profitable, those efforts do not necessarily equate with a promoter’s significant managerial efforts or control over the enterprise. See, e.g., Glenn W. Turner, 474 F.2d at 482 (finding that a multi-level marketing scheme was an investment contract and that investors relied on the promoter’s managerial efforts, despite the fact that investors put forth the majority of the labor that made the enterprise profitable, because the promoter dictated the terms and controlled the scheme itself); Long v. Shultz, 881 F.2d 129, 137 (5th Cir. 1989) (“An investor may authorize the assumption of particular risks that would create the possibility of greater profits or losses but still depend on a third party for all of the essential managerial efforts without which the risk could not pay off.”). See also generally SEC v. Merchant Capital, LLC, 483 F.3d 747 (11th Cir. 2007) (finding an investment contract even where voting rights were provided to purported general partners, noting that the voting process provided limited information for investors to make informed decisions, and the purported general partners lacked control over the information in the ballots).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The voting rights afforded DAO Token holders did not provide them with meaningful control over the enterprise, because (1) DAO Token holders’ ability to vote for contracts was a largely perfunctory one; and (2) DAO Token holders were widely dispersed and limited in their ability to communicate with one another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>First, as discussed above, DAO Token holders could only vote on proposals that had been cleared by the Curators.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_38"><sup><strong>(38)</strong></sup></a> And that clearance process did not include any mechanism to provide DAO Token holders with sufficient information to permit them to make informed voting decisions. Indeed, based on the particular facts concerning The DAO and the few draft proposals discussed in online forums, there are indications that contract proposals would not have necessarily provide enough information for investors to make an informed voting decision, affording them less meaningful control. For example, the sample contract proposal attached to the White Paper included little information concerning the terms of the contract. Also, the Slock.it co-founders put forth a draft of their own contract proposal and, in response to questions and requests to negotiate the terms of the proposal (posted to a DAO forum), a Slock.it founder explained that the proposal was intentionally vague and that it was, in essence, a take it or leave it proposition not subject to negotiation or feedback. See, e.g., SEC v. Shields, 744 F.3d 633, 643-45 (10th Cir. 2014) (in assessing whether agreements were investment contracts, court looked to whether “the investors actually had the type of control reserved under the agreements to obtain access to information necessary to protect, manage, and control their investments at the time they purchased their interests.”).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Second, the pseudonymity and dispersion of the DAO Token holders made it difficult for them to join together to effect change or to exercise meaningful control. Investments in The DAO were made pseudonymously (such that the real-world identities of investors are not apparent), and there was great dispersion among those individuals and/or entities who were invested in The DAO and thousands of individuals and/or entities that traded DAO Tokens in the secondary market—an arrangement that bears little resemblance to that of a genuine general partnership. Cf. Williamson v. Tucker, 645 F.2d 404, 422-24 (5th Cir. 1981) (“[O]ne would not expect partnership interests sold to large numbers of the general public to provide any real partnership control; at some point there would be so many [limited] partners that a partnership vote would be more like a corporate vote, each partner’s role having been diluted to the level of a single shareholder in a corporation.”).<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_39"><sup><strong>(39)</strong></sup></a> Slock.it did create and maintain online forums on which investors could submit posts regarding contract proposals, which were not limited to use by DAO Token holders (anyone was permitted to post). However, DAO Token holders were pseudonymous, as were their posts to the forums. Those facts, combined with the sheer number of DAO Token holders, potentially made the forums of limited use if investors hoped to consolidate their votes into blocs powerful enough to assert actual control. This was later demonstrated through the fact that DAO Token holders were unable to effectively address the Attack without the assistance of Slock.it and others. The DAO Token holders’ pseudonymity and dispersion diluted their control over The DAO. See Merchant Capital, 483 F.3d at 758 (finding geographic dispersion of investors weighing against investor control).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>These facts diminished the ability of DAO Token holders to exercise meaningful control over the enterprise through the voting process, rendering the voting rights of DAO Token holders akin to those of a corporate shareholder. Steinhardt Group, Inc. v. Citicorp., 126 F.3d 144, 152 (3d Cir. 1997) (“It must be emphasized that the assignment of nominal or limited responsibilities to the participant does not negate the existence of an investment contract; where the duties
assigned are so narrowly circumscribed as to involve little real choice of action … a security may be found to exist … . [The] emphasis must be placed on economic reality.”) (citing SEC v. Koscot Interplanetary, Inc., 497 F.2d 473, 483 n. 14 (5th Cir. 1974)).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>By contract and in reality, DAO Token holders relied on the significant managerial efforts provided by Slock.it and its co-founders, and The DAO’s Curators, as described above. Their efforts, not those of DAO Token holders, were the “undeniably significant” ones, essential to the overall success and profitability of any investment into The DAO. See Glenn W. Turner, 474 F.2d at 482.</p>

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The definition of “issuer” is broadly defined to include “every person who issues or proposes to issue any security” and “person” includes “any unincorporated organization.” 15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(4). The term “issuer” is flexibly construed in the Section 5 context “as issuers devise new ways to issue their securities and the definition of a security itself expands.” Doran v. Petroleum Mgmt. Corp., 545 F.2d 893, 909 (5th Cir. 1977); accord SEC v. Murphy, 626 F.2d 633, 644 (9th Cir. 1980) (“[W]hen a person [or entity] organizes or sponsors the organization of limited partnerships and is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the venture for which the partnership is formed, he will be considered an issuer … .”).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The DAO, an unincorporated organization, was an issuer of securities, and information about The DAO was “crucial” to the DAO Token holders’ investment decision. See Murphy, 626 F.2d at 643 (“Here there is no company issuing stock, but instead, a group of individuals investing funds in an enterprise for profit, and receiving in return an entitlement to a percentage of the proceeds of the enterprise.”) (citation omitted). The DAO was “responsible for the success or failure of the enterprise,” and accordingly was the entity about which the investors needed information material to their investment decision. Id. at 643-44. During the Offering Period, The DAO offered and sold DAO Tokens in exchange for ETH through The DAO Website, which was publicly-accessible, including to individuals in the United States. During the Offering Period, The DAO sold approximately 1.15 billion DAO Tokens in exchange for a total of approximately 12 million ETH, which was valued in USD, at the time, at approximately $150 million. Because DAO Tokens were securities, The DAO was required to register the offer and sale of DAO Tokens, unless a valid exemption from such registration applied.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Moreover, those who participate in an unregistered offer and sale of securities not subject to a valid exemption are liable for violating Section 5. See, e.g., Murphy, 626 F.2d at 650-51 (“[T]hose who ha[ve] a necessary role in the transaction are held liable as participants.”) (citing SEC v. North Am. Research &amp; Dev.

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Section 5 of the Exchange Act makes it unlawful for any broker, dealer, or exchange, directly or indirectly, to effect any transaction in a security, or to report any such transaction, in interstate commerce, unless the exchange is registered as a national securities exchange under Section 6 of the Exchange Act, or is exempted from such registration. See 15 U.S.C. §78e. Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act defines an “exchange” as “any organization, association, or group of persons, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which constitutes, maintains, or provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood … .” 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(1). Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) provides a functional test to assess whether a trading system meets the definition of exchange under Section 3(a)(1). Under Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a), an organization, association, or group of persons shall be considered to constitute, maintain, or provide “a marketplace or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange,” if such organization, association, or group of persons: (1) brings together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers; and (2) uses established, non-discretionary methods (whether by providing a trading facility or by setting rules) under which such orders interact with each other, and the buyers and sellers entering such orders agree to the terms of the trade.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_40"><sup><strong>(40)</strong></sup></a>
A system that meets the criteria of Rule 3b-16(a), and is not excluded under Rule 3b16(b), must register as a national securities exchange pursuant to Sections 5 and 6 of the Exchange Act <a href="#ico_dao_footnote_41"><sup><strong>(41)</strong></sup></a> or operate pursuant to an appropriate exemption. One frequently used exemption is for alternative trading systems (“ATS”).<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_42"><sup><strong>(42)</strong></sup></a> Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) exempts from the definition of “exchange” under Section 3(a)(1) an ATS that complies with Regulation ATS,<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_43"><sup><strong>(43)</strong></sup></a> which includes, among other things, the requirement to register as a broker-dealer and file a Form ATS with the Commission to provide notice of the ATS’s operations. Therefore, an ATS that operates pursuant to the Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) exemption and complies with Regulation ATS would not be subject to the registration requirement of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Platforms that traded DAO Tokens appear to have satisfied the criteria of Rule 3b16(a) and do not appear to have been excluded from Rule 3b-16(b).

</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Whether or not a particular transaction involves the offer and sale of a security— regardless of the terminology used—will depend on the facts and circumstances, including the economic realities of the transaction. Those who offer and sell securities in the United States must comply with the federal securities laws, including the requirement to register with the Commission or to qualify for an exemption from the registration requirements of the federal
securities laws. The registration requirements are designed to provide investors with procedural protections and material information necessary to make informed investment decisions. These requirements apply to those who offer and sell securities in the United States, regardless whether the issuing entity is a traditional company or a decentralized autonomous organization, regardless whether those securities are purchased using U.S. dollars or virtual currencies, and regardless whether they are distributed in certificated form or through distributed ledger technology. In addition, any entity or person engaging in the activities of an exchange, such as bringing together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers using established nondiscretionary methods under which such orders interact with each other and buyers and sellers entering such orders agree upon the terms of the trade, must register as a national securities exchange or operate pursuant to an exemption from such registration.</p>

customers may exchange virtual currencies for other virtual currencies or fiat currencies.</p>
</div>
<div id="ico_dao_footnote_21" class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>[21] According to the White Paper, the primary purpose of a split is to protect minority shareholders and prevent what
is commonly referred to as a “51% Attack,” whereby an attacker holding 51% of a DAO Entity’s Tokens could
create a proposal to send all of the DAO Entity’s funds to himself or herself.</p>
</div>
<div id="ico_dao_footnote_22" class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>[22] It was stated on The DAO Website and elsewhere that Slock.it anticipated that it would be the first to submit a
proposal for funding. In fact, a draft of Slock.it’s proposal for funding for an “Ethereum Computer and Universal
Sharing Network” was publicly-available online during the Offering Period.</p>
</div>
<div id="ico_dao_footnote_23" class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>[23] DAO Token holders could vote on proposals, either by direct interaction with the Ethereum Blockchain or by
using an application that interfaces with the Ethereum Blockchain. It was generally acknowledged that DAO Token
holders needed some technical knowledge in order to submit a vote, and The DAO Website included a link to a step-by-step tutorial describing how to vote on proposals.</p>
</div>
<div id="ico_dao_footnote_24" class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>[24] By voting on a proposal, DAO Token holders would “tie up” their tokens until the end of the voting cycle. See
Jentzsch, supra note 8 at 8 (“The tokens used to vote will be blocked, meaning they can not [sic] be transferred until
the proposal is closed.”). If, however, a DAO Token holder abstained from voting, the DAO Token holder could
avoid these restrictions; any DAO Tokens not submitted for a vote could be withdrawn or transferred at any time.
As a result, DAO Token holders were incentivized either to vote yes or to abstain from voting. See Dino Mark et al.,

The DAO’s Curator “Multisig” (or “private key”). These individuals all appear to live outside of the United States.
Many of them were associated with the Ethereum Foundation, and The DAO Website touted the qualifications and
trustworthiness of these individuals.</p>

The unnamed security expert would “act as the first point of contact for security disclosures, and continually monitor, pre-empt and avert any potential attack
vectors The DAO may face, including social, technical and economic attacks.” Id. Slock.it initially proposed a
much broader security proposal that included the formation of a “DAO Security” group, the establishment of a “Bug
Bounty Program,” and routine external audits of The DAO’s code. However, the cost of the proposal (125,000
ETH), which would be paid from The DAO’s funds, was immediately criticized as too high and Slock.it decided
instead to submit the revised proposal described above. See Stephan Tual, DAO.Security, a Proposal to guarantee

<p>[35] That the “projects” could encompass services and the creation of goods for use by DAO Token holders does not
change the core analysis that investors purchased DAO Tokens with the expectation of earning profits from the
efforts of others.</p>
</div>
<div id="ico_dao_footnote_36" class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>[36] DAO Token holders could put forth a proposal to split from The DAO, which would result in the creation of a
new DAO Entity with a new Curator. Other DAO Token holders would be allowed to join the new DAO Entity as
long as they voted yes to the original “split” proposal. Unlike all other contract proposals, a proposal to split did not require a deposit or a quorum, and it required a seven-day debating period instead of the minimum two-week
debating period required for other proposals.</p>
</div>
<div id="ico_dao_footnote_37" class="paragraph text-justify">

<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="quoteblock  text-justify">A general partnership or joint venture interest can be designated a security if the investor can establish, for example, that (1) an agreement among the parties leaves so little power in the hands of the partner or venture that the arrangement in fact distributes power as would a limited partnership; or (2) the partner or venturer is so inexperienced and unknowledgeable in business affairs that he is incapable of intelligently exercising his partnership or venture powers; or (3) the partner or venturer is so dependent on some unique entrepreneurial or managerial ability of the promoter or manager that he cannot replace the manager of the enterprise or otherwise exercise meaningful partnership or venture powers.</span></p>

<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>As described more fully below, EtherDelta is an online platform that allows buyers and sellers to trade certain digital assets – Ether and “ERC20 tokens” – in secondary market trading. ERC20 tokens refer to digital assets issued and distributed on the Ethereum Blockchain using the ERC20 protocol, which is the standard coding protocol currently used by a significant majority of issuers in Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”).<a href="#coburn_footnote_2"><strong><sup><em>(2)</em></sup></strong></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EtherDelta’s website, launched by Coburn on July 12, 2016, provides a user-friendly interface to EtherDelta and resembles online securities trading platforms. For example, the website makes token “pairs”<a href="#coburn_footnote_3"><strong><sup><em>(3)</em></sup></strong></a> available for trading, provides access to the EtherDelta order book, and displays the current, top 500 firm bids and offers by symbol, price, and size. The website also displays account information for users of the EtherDelta platform (“Users”) (tracked by the User’s Ethereum address and maintained in an internal ledger) and provides fields for Users to input trading interest in any token pair. Users may enter orders to buy or sell specified quantities of any ERC20 token at a specified price (in Ether) and with a specified time-in-force. The website also displays to Users market depth<a href="#coburn_footnote_4"><strong><sup><em>(4)</em></sup></strong></a> charts and a list of confirmed trades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On July 25, 2017, the Commission issued its Report of Investigation Pursuant To Section 21(a) Of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO (Exchange Act Rel. No. 81207) (July 25, 2017) (the “DAO Report”). In the DAO Report, the Commission advised that a platform that offers trading of digital assets that are securities and operates as an “exchange,” as defined by the federal securities laws, must register with the Commission as a national securities exchange or be exempt from registration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From July 12, 2016 to December 15, 2017 (the “Relevant Period”), more than 3.6 million buy and sell orders in ERC20 tokens that included securities as defined by Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act were traded on EtherDelta, of which approximately 92% (3.3 million) were traded during the period following the DAO Report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As discussed further below, EtherDelta meets the criteria of an “exchange” as defined by Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 3b-16 thereunder. During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta was not registered with the Commission as a national securities exchange and it did not operate pursuant to any exemption from registration. As a result, and as discussed further below, Coburn should have known that his actions would contribute to EtherDelta’s violations and thus, under Exchange Act Section 21C(a), caused EtherDelta to violate Section 5 of the Exchange Act.</p>

<p>Coburn, age 31, is a resident of Chicago, Illinois.

In approximately June 2015, Coburn left that firm to pursue his own business interests. In March 2016, he created EtherOpt, an online platform for trading options and, in July 2016, he created EtherDelta.<a href="#coburn_footnote_5"><strong><sup><em>(5)</em></sup></strong></a> In November 2017, Coburn entered into an agreement to sell EtherDelta to foreign buyers and, as of December 16, 2017, Coburn ceased to collect any fees from Users of the platform.

</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="7">
<li>
<p>As seen below, the EtherDelta website had features similar to online securities trading platforms. For each Ether/ERC20 token pair available for trading on EtherDelta, the website provided access to the EtherDelta order book and displayed the top 500 orders to buy and orders to sell, sorted by price and color (buy orders are green and sell orders are red). The website provided User account information and provided fields for Users to input deposit, withdrawal, and trading interest. The website also provided Users’ daily transaction volumes per token, market depth charts, and a list of User’s confirmed trades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the Relevant Period, the EtherDelta platform was available to anyone, including U.S. persons, and had no specified hours of operation. As long as EtherDelta’s website was operational, Users could interact directly with the EtherDelta smart contract or enter orders and trade tokens through the website 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>

<p><span class="underline">The EtherDelta Smart Contract</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="9">
<li>
<p>EtherDelta’s business operations are defined and executed by EtherDelta’s “smart contract”<a href="#coburn_footnote_6"><strong><sup><em>(6)</em></sup></strong></a> that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain. The EtherDelta smart contract consists of coded functions<a href="#coburn_footnote_7"><strong><sup><em>(7)</em></sup></strong></a> that allow for, among other things, the trading of any Ether/ ERC20 token pair.<a href="#coburn_footnote_8"><strong><sup><em>(8)</em></sup></strong></a> On July 8, 2016, Coburn deployed the code for the first EtherDelta smart contract, written in the programming language Solidity, onto the Ethereum Blockchain. When it was deployed, the EtherDelta smart contract created an Ethereum Blockchain address, where the smart contract “resides.”<a href="#coburn_footnote_9"><strong><sup><em>(9)</em></sup></strong></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the EtherDelta smart contract runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, every interaction with EtherDelta by a User requires the User to send a message to the Ethereum Blockchain mining network to be executed on the EtherDelta smart contract.<a href="#coburn_footnote_10"><strong><sup><em>(10)</em></sup></strong></a> When Ethereum Blockchain miners run the EtherDelta smart contract, the smart contract applies a preexisting set of rules (i.e., its code) to given inputs. If the User’s message results in a change of state to the Ethereum Blockchain, such as through a User request to move or withdraw ERC20 tokens to and from the EtherDelta smart contract, or through a User request to trade on the EtherDelta platform, among other things, the Ethereum Blockchain miners then record that change of state, i.e., reflecting the transfer of Ether and/or ERC20 tokens to and from addresses, to the Ethereum Blockchain. If the User’s message does not result in a change of state, such as through a User request to check the balance of the User’s Ethereum address on EtherDelta, there is no change of state recorded to the Ethereum Blockchain.</p>

<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline">EtherDelta User Eligibility</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="11">
<li>
<p>As a prerequisite for submitting an order to the platform, a User must first have an Ethereum wallet address that is capable of sending messages to the Ethereum Blockchain. Users may create a new wallet address through EtherDelta’s website or by using other wallet software that is compatible with EtherDelta. Users trade on EtherDelta pseudonymously by using one or more Ethereum addresses, each a unique string of numbers and letters. Users must also demonstrate that they have available ERC20 tokens or Ether to trade on EtherDelta.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline">Tokens Eligible for Trading and EtherDelta’s “Official Listings”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="12">
<li>
<p>Users may enter orders to buy or sell any token that is ERC20 compliant. Coburn purposely wrote the EtherDelta smart contract to include the ERC20 token coding standard and there are no rules set forth in the smart contract that limit a User from trading any particular ERC20 token on EtherDelta.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta maintained a list of “official [token] listings, a select list of ERC20 Tokens that were available for trading on EtherDelta.” Prior to identifying a token as an official listing, Coburn requested certain information from a token issuer (e.g., the token’s name, associated website URL, and a paragraph describing the token) and performed his own due diligence on these tokens. Official listings appeared on a drop down menu on a sidebar on EtherDelta’s website for easy User accessibility. During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta had approximately 500 official token listings.</p>
</li>

<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline">The EtherDelta Order Book</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="14">
<li>
<p>With respect to a given order, an EtherDelta User is identified as either a “maker” or “taker” on the EtherDelta platform. A maker is someone that posts an order to buy or sell a particular ERC20 token on the EtherDelta website, which signals to other Users their intention to trade a particular token at a specific price, size, and time. A taker is someone seeking to become the counterparty to a maker’s order on the platform.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Order Types and Order Entry</em></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="15">
<li>
<p>The only order type available on EtherDelta is a limit order to buy or sell a token at a specific price. There are no market orders.<a href="#coburn_footnote_11"><strong><sup><em>(11)</em></sup></strong></a>  Users indicate their interest to buy or sell a token by entering a buy or sell order. At the time an order is entered, Users provide the following information onto the EtherDelta’s website: token symbol, size, price and time-in-force (measured in “blocks”).<a href="#coburn_footnote_12"><strong><sup><em>(12)</em></sup></strong></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike other operations on EtherDelta, entering an order on EtherDelta does not change the state of the Ethereum Blockchain and, as a result, there is no gas fee (paid in Ether to the Ethereum miners) associated with entering an order on EtherDelta. Rather, all orders are stored in EtherDelta’s order book, which resides on a centralized server maintained by EtherDelta and not on the Ethereum Blockchain.<a href="#coburn_footnote_13"><strong><sup><em>(13)</em></sup></strong></a>  As discussed above, for each token pair, EtherDelta’s website displays only the top 500 buy and sell orders, sorted by price and order type (buy or sell).</p>
</li>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Order Execution and the Order Book</em></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="17">
<li>
<p>All orders on EtherDelta must be acted upon by a taker for a trade to occur. When a taker seeks to trade with a maker’s order, the taker, through the EtherDelta website interface, clicks on an order displayed on EtherDelta’s order book and enters the size of the order. This pairs the maker’s cryptographically-signed intent to trade (i.e., the maker order) with the taker’s cryptographically-signed intent to trade (i.e., the taker’s order) and instructs the Ethereum Blockchain miners to run the EtherDelta smart contract, which automatically performs certain checks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No further confirmation or action is required by the taker for the taker’s message to be executed by the smart contract and for a trade to occur. The smart contract checks that the messages are valid (contain valid cryptographic signatures), confirms the conditions of the orders (i.e., orders have not expired or been canceled) and that both Users have sufficient funds and/or tokens to complete the trade. If the messages are valid and there are sufficient funds and/or tokens, the trade is executed and the smart contract will update the smart contract’s internal ledger to reflect the trade. The maker order will remain displayed on EtherDelta’s website until the miners write the trade and post it to the Ethereum Blockchain. Thereafter, information displayed on the EtherDelta order book and website is updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a taker clicks on a maker’s order, this action will automatically result in a trade unless: (1) there are insufficient funds and/or tokens to complete the trade or pay the gas fee; (2) a competing taker’s order is confirmed on the Blockchain first; (3) the maker’s order has expired; or (4) the maker or taker’s order has been cancelled.<a href="#coburn_footnote_14"><strong><sup><em>(14)</em></sup></strong></a></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>A. EtherDelta Violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="23">
<li>
<p>Section 5 of the Exchange Act makes it unlawful for any broker, dealer, or exchange, directly or indirectly, to effect any transaction in a security, or to report any such transaction, in interstate commerce, unless the exchange is registered as a national securities exchange under Section 6 of the Exchange Act, or is exempted from such registration. Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act defines an “exchange” as “any organization, association, or group of persons, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which constitutes, maintains, or provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood, and includes the market place and the market facilities maintained by such exchange.” 15 USC § 78c(a)(1).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) provides a functional test to assess whether a trading system meets the definition of exchange under Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) provides that an organization, association, or group of persons shall be considered to constitute, maintain, or provide “a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by an exchange” as those terms are used in Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act if such an organization, association, or group of persons: (1) brings together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers; and (2) uses established, non-discretionary methods (whether by providing a trading facility or by setting rules) under which such orders interact with each other, and the buyers and sellers entering such orders agree to the terms of the trade.<a href="#coburn_footnote_18"><strong><sup><em>(18)</em></sup></strong></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A system that meets the criteria of Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a), and is not excluded under Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(b), must register, pursuant to Section 5 of the Exchange Act, as a national securities exchange under Section 6 of the Exchange Act<a href="#coburn_footnote_19"><strong><sup><em>(19)</em></sup></strong></a> or operate pursuant to an appropriate exemption. One of the available exemptions is for alternative trading systems (“ATSs”).<a href="#coburn_footnote_20"><strong><sup><em>(20)</em></sup></strong></a> Exchange Act Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) exempts from the definition of “exchange” under Section 3(a)(1) an organization, association, or group of persons that complies with Regulation ATS.<a href="#coburn_footnote_21"><strong><sup><em>(21)</em></sup></strong></a> Regulation ATS requires an ATS to, among other things, register as a broker-dealer, file a Form ATS with the Commission to notice its operations, and establish written safeguards and procedures to protect subscribers’ confidential trading information. An ATS that complies with Regulation ATS and operates pursuant to the Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) exemption would not be required by Section 5 to register as a national securities exchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EtherDelta satisfied the criteria of Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) and is not excluded under Rule 3b-16(b). During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta operated as a market place for bringing together the orders of multiple buyers and sellers in tokens that included securities as defined by Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act. The purchasers of such digital tokens invested money with a reasonable expectation of profits, including through the increased value of their investments in secondary trading, based on the managerial efforts of others. See DAO Report; SEC v. Edwards, 540 U.S. 389, 393 (2004); SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 301 (1946). As discussed above, EtherDelta brought together orders by receiving and storing orders in tokens in the EtherDelta order book and displaying the top 500 orders (including token symbol, size, and price) as bids and offers on the EtherDelta website. EtherDelta provided the means for these orders to interact and execute through the combined use of the EtherDelta website, order book, and pre-programmed trading protocols defined in the EtherDelta smart contract. These established non-discretionary methods allowed Users to agree upon the terms of their trades in tokens on EtherDelta during the Relevant Period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite operating as a Rule 3b-16(a) system, EtherDelta did not register as a national securities exchange or operate pursuant to an exemption from such registration. Accordingly, EtherDelta violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act.</p>

<p>[2] An ICO is a term that describes the offer and sale of digital assets issued and distributed on a blockchain. A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, or peer-to-peer database spread across a network, that records all transactions in the network in theoretically unchangeable, digitally-recorded data packages called blocks. Each block contains a batch of records of transactions, including a timestamp and a reference to the previous block, linking the blocks together in a chain. The system relies on cryptographic techniques for secure recording of transactions. A blockchain can be shared and accessed by anyone with appropriate permissions. The Ethereum Blockchain is an open, or permissionless, blockchain that is a record of events resulting from the execution of code (smart contracts) on the Ethereum Blockchain. ERC20 refers to a specific Ethereum token issuing protocol, formally adopted by the Ethereum network in September 2017, and used on the Ethereum Blockchain. (ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comments and 20 is the unique identification used to distinguish this coding standard from other standards.) The ERC20 token standard, created in November 2015, “allows any token on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges” and “provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.” See Fabian Vogelsteller and Vitalik Buterin, ERC-20 Token Standard, November 19, 2015, <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md" class="bare">https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md</a>. The widespread adoption of the ERC20 token standard has also led developers to design applications, such as EtherDelta, that are compatible with any ERC20 token.</p>
</div>
<div id="coburn_footnote_3" class="paragraph">
<p>[3] Token pair refers to a trade between one digital asset and either another digital asset or fiat currency. On EtherDelta, the only token pairs available for trading were those between a particular ERC20 token and Ether.</p>
</div>
<div id="coburn_footnote_4" class="paragraph">
<p>[4] The term “market depth” refers to the number of open buy and sell orders for a particular token at different prices, and provides an indication of a particular token’s liquidity.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="quoteblock">a computerized transaction protocol that executes terms of a contract. The general objectives of smart contract design are to satisfy common contractual conditions (such as payment terms, liens, confidentiality, and even enforcement), minimize exceptions both malicious and accidental, and minimize the need for trusted intermediaries.

Alternatively, during the Relevant Period, Users could interact with the EtherDelta smart contract through a user-friendly interface created by Coburn, called The EtherDelta Graphic User Interface (“EtherDelta GUI” or “website”) (accessible at the URL www.etherdelta.com).

<div id="coburn_footnote_10" class="paragraph">
<p>[10] Anyone can interact with the Ethereum Blockchain by transmitting a cryptographically-secured message to the Blockchain. That message can be “state-changing” in that it can request that a particular smart contract on the Ethereum Blockchain perform a certain function that results in a change of state of the Blockchain. A state-changing message is also referred to as a “Send.” Alternatively, a message can simply request information already written to the Blockchain, and not result in a change to the state of the Blockchain. That type of message is referred to as a “Call.” Any Send must first be validated and the resulting change of state recorded to the Blockchain by the “mining” activities of a network of Ethereum “miners,” which are computing nodes on the Blockchain. A Send generally requires the payment of “gas,” or a fee paid in Ether to the Ethereum miners. Generally (but not always), the speed at which a transaction is mined on the Ethereum Blockchain is determined by the amount of gas paid by the sender of a transaction to the mining network; the higher the gas price paid for the transaction, the faster a transaction is likely to be mined. The gas price is set by the sender at the time the message is sent to the network.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit: Crypto</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thank you Andy. I am pleased to be here today. This event provides a great opportunity to address a topic that is the subject of considerable debate in the press and in the crypto-community&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;whether a digital asset offered as a security can, over time, become something other than a security.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To start, we should frame the question differently and focus not on the digital asset itself, but on the circumstances surrounding the digital asset and the manner in which it is sold. To that end, a better line of inquiry is: “Can a digital asset that was originally offered in a securities offering ever be later sold in a manner that does not constitute an offering of a security?” In cases where the digital asset represents a set of rights that gives the holder a financial interest in an enterprise, the answer is likely “no.” In these cases, calling the transaction an initial coin offering, or “ICO,” or a sale of a “token,” will not take it out of the purview of the U.S. securities laws.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But what about cases where there is no longer any central enterprise being invested in or where the digital asset is sold only to be used to purchase a good or service available through the network on which it was created? I believe in these cases the answer is a qualified “yes.” I would like to share my thinking with you today about the circumstances under which that could occur.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before I turn to the securities law analysis, let me share what I believe may be most exciting about distributed ledger technology&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that is, the potential to share information, transfer value, and record transactions in a decentralized digital environment. Potential applications include supply chain management, intellectual property rights licensing, stock ownership transfers and countless others. There is real value in creating applications that can be accessed and executed electronically with a public, immutable record and without the need for a trusted third party to verify transactions. Some people believe that this technology will transform e-commerce as we know it. There is excitement and a great deal of speculative interest around this new technology. Unfortunately, there also are cases of fraud. In many regards, it is still “early days.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But I am not here to discuss the promise of technology&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;there are many in attendance and speaking here today that can do a much better job of that. I would like to focus on the application of the federal securities laws to digital asset transactions&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that is how tokens and coins are being issued, distributed and sold. While perhaps a bit dryer than the promise of the blockchain, this topic is critical to the broader acceptance and use of these novel instruments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I will begin by describing what I often see. Promoters, in order to raise money to develop networks on which digital assets will operate, often sell the tokens or coins rather than sell shares, issue notes or obtain bank financing. But, in many cases, the economic substance is the same as a conventional securities offering. Funds are raised with the expectation that the promoters will build their system and investors can earn a return on the instrument&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;usually by selling their tokens in the secondary market once the promoters create something of value with the proceeds and the value of the digital enterprise increases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we see that kind of economic transaction, it is easy to apply the Supreme Court&#8217;s “investment contract” test first announced in SEC v. Howey. That test requires an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others. And it is important to reflect on the facts of Howey. A hotel operator sold interests in a citrus grove to its guests and claimed it was selling real estate, not securities. While the transaction was recorded as a real estate sale, it also included a service contract to cultivate and harvest the oranges. The purchasers could have arranged to service the grove themselves but, in fact, most were passive, relying on the efforts of Howey-in-the-Hills Service, Inc. for a return. In articulating the test for an investment contract, the Supreme Court stressed: “Form [is] disregarded for substance and the emphasis [is] placed upon economic reality.” So the purported real estate purchase was found to be an investment contract&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;an investment in orange groves was in these circumstances an investment in a security.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just as in the Howey case, tokens and coins are often touted as assets that have a use in their own right, coupled with a promise that the assets will be cultivated in a way that will cause them to grow in value, to be sold later at a profit. And, as in Howey&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;where interests in the groves were sold to hotel guests, not farmers&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;tokens and coins typically are sold to a wide audience rather than to persons who are likely to use them on the network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the ICOs I have seen, overwhelmingly, promoters tout their ability to create an innovative application of blockchain technology. Like in Howey, the investors are passive. Marketing efforts are rarely narrowly targeted to token users. And typically at the outset, the business model and very viability of the application is still uncertain. The purchaser usually has no choice but to rely on the efforts of the promoter to build the network and make the enterprise a success. At that stage, the purchase of a token looks a lot like a bet on the success of the enterprise and not the purchase of something used to exchange for goods or services on the network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an aside, you might ask, given that these token sales often look like securities offerings, why are the promoters choosing to package the investment as a coin or token offering? This is an especially good question if the network on which the token or coin will function is not yet operational. I think there can be a number of reasons. For a while, some believed such labeling might, by itself, remove the transaction from the securities laws. I think people now realize labeling an investment opportunity as a coin or token does not achieve that result. Second, this labeling might have been used to bring some marketing “sizzle” to the enterprise. That might still work to some extent, but the track record of ICOs is still being sorted out and some of that sizzle may now be more of a potential warning flare for investors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some may be attracted to a blockchain-mediated crowdfunding process. Digital assets can represent an efficient way to reach a global audience where initial purchasers have a stake in the success of the network and become part of a network where their participation adds value beyond their investment contributions. The digital assets are then exchanged&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for some, to help find the market price for the new application; for others, to speculate on the venture. As I will discuss, whether a transaction in a coin or token on the secondary market amounts to an offer or sale of a security requires a careful and fact-sensitive legal analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I believe some industry participants are beginning to realize that, in some circumstances, it might be easier to start a blockchain-based enterprise in a more conventional way. In other words, conduct the initial funding through a registered or exempt equity or debt offering and, once the network is up and running, distribute or offer blockchain-based tokens or coins to participants who need the functionality the network and the digital assets offer. This allows the tokens or coins to be structured and offered in a way where it is evident that purchasers are not making an investment in the development of the enterprise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Returning to the ICOs I am seeing, strictly speaking, the token&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;or coin or whatever the digital information packet is called&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;all by itself is not a security, just as the orange groves in Howey were not. Central to determining whether a security is being sold is how it is being sold and the reasonable expectations of purchasers. When someone buys a housing unit to live in, it is probably not a security. But under certain circumstances, the same asset can be offered and sold in a way that causes investors to have a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others. For example, if the housing unit is offered with a management contract or other services, it can be a security. Similarly, when a CD, exempt from being treated as a security under Section 3 of the Securities Act, is sold as a part of a program organized by a broker who offers retail investors promises of liquidity and the potential to profit from changes in interest rates, the Gary Plastic case teaches us that the instrument can be part of an investment contract that is a security.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same reasoning applies to digital assets. The digital asset itself is simply code. But the way it is sold&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;as part of an investment; to non-users; by promoters to develop the enterprise&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;can be, and, in that context, most often is, a security&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;because it evidences an investment contract. And regulating these transactions as securities transactions makes sense. The impetus of the Securities Act is to remove the information asymmetry between promoters and investors. In a public distribution, the Securities Act prescribes the information investors need to make an informed investment decision, and the promoter is liable for material misstatements in the offering materials. These are important safeguards, and they are appropriate for most ICOs. The disclosures required under the federal securities laws nicely complement the Howey investment contract element about the efforts of others. As an investor, the success of the enterprise&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and the ability to realize a profit on the investment&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;turns on the efforts of the third party. So learning material information about the third party&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;its background, financing, plans, financial stake and so forth&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;is a prerequisite to making an informed investment decision. Without a regulatory framework that promotes disclosure of what the third party alone knows of these topics and the risks associated with the venture, investors will be uninformed and are at risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But this also points the way to when a digital asset transaction may no longer represent a security offering. If the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;where purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the assets may not represent an investment contract. Moreover, when the efforts of the third party are no longer a key factor for determining the enterprise&#8217;s success, material information asymmetries recede. As a network becomes truly decentralized, the ability to identify an issuer or promoter to make the requisite disclosures becomes difficult, and less meaningful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And so, when I look at Bitcoin today, I do not see a central third party whose efforts are a key determining factor in the enterprise. The network on which Bitcoin functions is operational and appears to have been decentralized for some time, perhaps from inception. Applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to the offer and resale of Bitcoin would seem to add little value. And putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. And, as with Bitcoin, applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to current transactions in Ether would seem to add little value. Over time, there may be other sufficiently decentralized networks and systems where regulating the tokens or coins that function on them as securities may not be required. And of course there will continue to be systems that rely on central actors whose efforts are a key to the success of the enterprise. In those cases, application of the securities laws protects the investors who purchase the tokens or coins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I would like to emphasize that the analysis of whether something is a security is not static and does not strictly inhere to the instrument. Even digital assets with utility that function solely as a means of exchange in a decentralized network could be packaged and sold as an investment strategy that can be a security. If a promoter were to place Bitcoin in a fund or trust and sell interests, it would create a new security. Similarly, investment contracts can be made out of virtually any asset (including virtual assets), provided the investor is reasonably expecting profits from the promoter&#8217;s efforts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let me emphasize an earlier point: simply labeling a digital asset a “utility token” does not turn the asset into something that is not a security. I recognize that the Supreme Court has acknowledged that if someone is purchasing an asset for consumption only, it is likely not a security. But, the economic substance of the transaction always determines the legal analysis, not the labels. The oranges in Howey had utility. Or in my favorite example, the Commission warned in the late 1960s about investment contracts sold in the form of whisky warehouse receipts. Promoters sold the receipts to U.S. investors to finance the aging and blending processes of Scotch whisky. The whisky was real&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and, for some, had exquisite utility. But Howey was not selling oranges and the warehouse receipts promoters were not selling whisky for consumption. They were selling investments, and the purchasers were expecting a return from the promoters' efforts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Promoters and other market participants need to understand whether transactions in a particular digital asset involve the sale of a security. We are happy to help promoters and their counsel work through these issues. We stand prepared to provide more formal interpretive or no-action guidance about the proper characterization of a digital asset in a proposed use. In addition, we recognize that there are numerous implications under the federal securities laws of a particular asset being considered a security. For example, our Divisions of Trading and Markets and Investment Management are focused on such issues as broker-dealer, exchange and fund registration, as well as matters of market manipulation, custody and valuation. We understand that market participants are working to make their services compliant with the existing regulatory framework, and we are happy to continue our engagement in this process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What are some of the factors to consider in assessing whether a digital asset is offered as an investment contract and is thus a security? Primarily, consider whether a third party&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;be it a person, entity or coordinated group of actors&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;drives the expectation of a return. That question will always depend on the particular facts and circumstances, and this list is illustrative, not exhaustive:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Is there a person or group that has sponsored or promoted the creation and sale of the digital asset, the efforts of whom play a significant role in the development and maintenance of the asset and its potential increase in value?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has this person or group retained a stake or other interest in the digital asset such that it would be motivated to expend efforts to cause an increase in value in the digital asset? Would purchasers reasonably believe such efforts will be undertaken and may result in a return on their investment in the digital asset?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has the promoter raised an amount of funds in excess of what may be needed to establish a functional network, and, if so, has it indicated how those funds may be used to support the value of the tokens or to increase the value of the enterprise? Does the promoter continue to expend funds from proceeds or operations to enhance the functionality and/or value of the system within which the tokens operate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are purchasers “investing,” that is seeking a return? In that regard, is the instrument marketed and sold to the general public instead of to potential users of the network for a price that reasonably correlates with the market value of the good or service in the network?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does application of the Securities Act protections make sense? Is there a person or entity others are relying on that plays a key role in the profit-making of the enterprise such that disclosure of their activities and plans would be important to investors? Do informational asymmetries exist between the promoters and potential purchasers/investors in the digital asset?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do persons or entities other than the promoter exercise governance rights or meaningful influence?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While these factors are important in analyzing the role of any third party, there are contractual or technical ways to structure digital assets so they function more like a consumer item and less like a security. Again, we would look to the economic substance of the transaction, but promoters and their counsels should consider these, and other, possible features. This list is not intended to be exhaustive and by no means do I believe each and every one of these factors needs to be present to establish a case that a token is not being offered as a security. This list is meant to prompt thinking by promoters and their counsel, and start the dialogue with the staff&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it is not meant to be a list of all necessary factors in a legal analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Is token creation commensurate with meeting the needs of users or, rather, with feeding speculation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are independent actors setting the price or is the promoter supporting the secondary market for the asset or otherwise influencing trading?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it clear that the primary motivation for purchasing the digital asset is for personal use or consumption, as compared to investment? Have purchasers made representations as to their consumptive, as opposed to their investment, intent? Are the tokens available in increments that correlate with a consumptive versus investment intent?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the tokens distributed in ways to meet users' needs? For example, can the tokens be held or transferred only in amounts that correspond to a purchaser&#8217;s expected use? Are there built-in incentives that compel using the tokens promptly on the network, such as having the tokens degrade in value over time, or can the tokens be held for extended periods for investment?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the asset marketed and distributed to potential users or the general public?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the assets dispersed across a diverse user base or concentrated in the hands of a few that can exert influence over the application?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the application fully functioning or in early stages of development?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are exciting legal times and I am pleased to be part of a process that can help promoters of this new technology and their counsel navigate and comply with the federal securities laws.</p>

<p>Based on the facts presented, the Division will not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if, in reliance on your opinion as counsel that the Tokens are not securities, TKJ offers and sells the Tokens without registration under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Capitalized terms have the same meanings as defined in your letter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In reaching this position, we particularly note that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>TKJ will not use any funds from Token sales to develop the TKJ Platform, Network, or App, and each of these will be fully developed and operational at the time any Tokens are sold;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Tokens will be immediately usable for their intended functionality (purchasing air charter services) at the time they are sold;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TKJ will restrict transfers of Tokens to TKJ Wallets only, and not to wallets external to the Platform;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TKJ will sell Tokens at a price of one USD per Token throughout the life of the Program, and each Token will represent a TKJ obligation to supply air charter services at a value of one USD per Token;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If TKJ offers to repurchase Tokens, it will only do so at a discount to the face value of the Tokens (one USD per Token) that the holder seeks to resell to TKJ, unless a court within the United States orders TKJ to liquidate the Tokens; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Token is marketed in a manner that emphasizes the functionality of the Token, and not the potential for the increase in the market value of the Token.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This position is based on the representations made to the Division in your letter. Any different facts or conditions might require the Division to reach a different conclusion.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contends that LBRY, Inc. offered and sold unregistered securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. LBRY responds that it does not need to comply with the Securities Act because its alleged security, a blockchain token called LBC, is not a security at all. Instead, it argues that LBC functions as a digital currency that is an essential component of the LBRY Blockchain. LBRY also a sserts that the SEC&#8217;s attempt to treat LBC as a security violates its right to due process because the agency did not give LBRY fair notice that its offerings of LBC are subject to the securities laws. The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment addressing both issues</p>

<p><strong>I&period; <span class="underline">BACKGROUND</span></strong></p>

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The nascent technology known as blockchain operates in the background of this dispute. From its earliest days, proponents of blockchain technology have envisioned it as fundamentally altering many aspects of modern life. See Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (2008), <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" class="bare">https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf</a> (outlining the idea for a peer-topeer electronic payment system). As LBRY explains, a blockchain is essentially a “decentralized ledger maintained by a network of independently owned computers.” See Kauffman Decl., <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682">Doc. No. 61-3</a> at 2 ¶ 5.

<p>To establish a prima facie violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act, the SEC must prove that LBRY offered or sold securities in interstate commerce without filing a registration statement. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iedab2640c58d11ecbf45df569f0c2bfa/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_8173_939">SEC v.

Nor does it argue that its past offerings fall within an exemption to the registration requirement. Thus, the only issues impeding a finding that LBRY violated Section 5 are LBRY&#8217;s claim that it did not offer LBC as a security and its argument that it was not given fair notice that it needed to register its offerings.

The First Circuit has broken the Howey test into three parts: “(1) the investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with an expectation of profits to be derived solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.” <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I13202b1079bf11d9ac1ffa9f33b6c3b0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_48">SG Ltd., 265 F.3d at 46</a>.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1&period; LBRY&#8217;s Representations to Potential Purchasers</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The SEC identifies multiple statements by LBRY that it claims led potential investors to reasonably expect that LBC would grow in value as the company continued to oversee the development of the LBRY Network. LBRY minimizes the significance of these statements, and points to its many disclaimers that it did not intend for LBC to be purchased as an investment, but the SEC is correct. LBRY has - at key moments and despite its protestations - been acutely aware of LBC&#8217;s potential value as an investment. And it made sure potential investors were too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>When LBRY launched the LBRY Network in June 2016, LBC&#8217;s market capitalization was a healthy $140 million. <span class="underline">See</span> 7/15/2016 LBRY Article, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">Doc. No. 57-11</a>. This, despite the Network&#8217;s relative infancy and limited usability. By the following month, LBC&#8217;s market capitalization had ballooned to $1.2 billion. <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">Id.</a> In response, LBRY issued a blog post reflecting on LBC&#8217;s skyrocketing value. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">id.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>LBRY captioned the post: “1.2B Market Cap and We Don&#8217;t Care.” Id. It began by touting the rapid growth in LBC&#8217;s value, but frankly acknowledged that it could not say whether the current valuation was justified. <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">id.</a> At that point, only three videos were available on the blockchain, each produced by LBRY itself. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">id.</a> And LBRY&#8217;s staff were hard at work “frantically debugging” and developing its product. <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">id.</a> What LBRY did claim to know though was “that the long-term value proposition of LBRY is tremendous, but also dependent on our team staying focused on the task at hand: building this thing.” <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">id.</a> It then closed the post by announcing a policy of neutrality with respect to LBC&#8217;s price but plainly stating that “[o]ver the long-term, the interests of LBRY and the holders of [LBC] are aligned.” <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">id.</a></p>

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In August 2016, the COO of LBRY, Josh Finer, emailed a potential investor explaining that the company was “currently negotiating private placements of LBC with several [other] investors” and asked the recipient to write him back “if there is interest” so the two could “chat.” <span class="underline">See</span> COO Email, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488">Doc.

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>By November 2016, LBC&#8217;s price was down, and some LBC investors were getting jittery. Jeremy Kauffman, LBRY&#8217;s CEO, published a blog post titled “Acryptypical: The CEO of LBRY on the price of LBC,” outlining his view of LBRY&#8217;s condition and providing “a canonical answer to questions about the price of LBC.” <span class="underline">See</span> 11/15/2016 Article, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463">Doc.

LBC&#8217;s price was low, he contended, because of simple economics: the supply of LBC entering circulation through mining was outpacing the demand for new tokens. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463">id.</a> And demand was low because, at that point, “there [was] no reason to buy” LBC. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463">id.</a> When LBRY launched, Kauffman explained, it was “the barest, minimum proof-of-concept [application] possible.” <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463">id.</a></p>

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Although it had only been a few months since the launch, LBRY still stressed its long-term goal of “buil[ding] a product that is compelling enough to change people&#8217;s habits,” replacing “YouTube” and “Amazon.” <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463">id.</a> And while investors were unlikely to make a “quick buck,” Kauffman encouraged them to “hold onto [their LBC] (or spend it to buy some of [LBRY&#8217;s] great content . . . .).” <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463">id.</a> LBRY&#8217;s message was clear: We are a work in progress. LBC reflects that. Bear with us.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In another communication, this time on Reddit, a user who was “trying to do [their] research before putting in [their] money” asked some general questions about how LBRY would manage its holdings of LBC. <span class="underline">See</span> Reddit Thread, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791462">Doc.

Vine explained how the future “value of LBRY credits” would depend on “the success of our media marketplace.” <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791461">id.</a> When the interviewer asked how LBRY would keep “stolen[,] . . . unsavory, or downright illegal” content from the protocol, Vine&#8217;s response betrayed LBRY&#8217;s powerbroking role within its ecosystem by explaining that LBRY might be able to use its “position as the ‘market maker’ of [LBC] to basically make it more expensive for people to abuse the network.” <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791461">id.</a></p>

<p>In January 2018, Kauffman wrote further on the benefits of blockchain technology in another essay entitled “Blockchain is Love, Blockchain is Life.”
<span class="underline">See</span> 1/10/2018 LBRY Article, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458">Doc. No. 57-16</a>. There, he wrote about what he called the “incentive problem[]” in developing open-source alternatives to existing technologies that are controlled by private companies. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458">id.</a> One solution to this problem, as Kauffman saw it, was to be found in blockchain technology, which allowed for blockchain tokens to be used to realign incentives. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458">id.</a> Because a blockchain token “has value in proportion to the usage and success of the network,” developers are incentivized to work to develop and promote new uses for blockchain. <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458">Id.</a> As Kauffman put it:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p><span class="quoteblock"><code><em>"It means that the people who discover and utilize a new protocol or network when it&#8217;s just getting off the ground can reap substantial value by being there first. This solves the incentive problems around being a first-mover and softens the pain of using a service that probably won&#8217;t be as feature-rich or slick as established competitors' options. It provides a source of funding for the development of the protocol. The creators can use the token to pay for the salaries and equipment required to get it started."</em></code></span></p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>And in yet another post, this time in October 2020, LBRY provided another positive update. <span class="underline">See</span> 10/14/2020 LBRY Article, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466">Doc. No. 57-24</a>. It explained that it still saw itself as meeting the consumer “demand for a userowned and controlled alternative to YouTube and big tech.” <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466">id.</a> Indeed, its work creating a “compelling token economy centered around digital content exchange” was still “imminently achievable” with just “some tweaks.” <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466">id.</a> LBRY also touted the enormous potential it saw in continuing to develop its application on its blockchain. Other blockchain companies, the post asserted, are forced to rely on “some third-party” to “magicly [sic] build a world-class application” on their blockchains. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466">id.</a> Not LBRY. And since “[a]pplications used by billions of people can be worth trillions of dollars,” LBRY was uniquely poised to “deliver that value” by “own[ing] the whole stack.” <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466">id.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>These statements are representative of LBRY&#8217;s overall messaging about the growth potential for LBC, and thus the SEC is correct that potential investors would understand that LBRY was pitching a speculative value proposition for its digital token. LBRY&#8217;s messaging amounts to precisely the “not-very-subtle form of economic inducement” the First Circuit identified in <span class="underline">SG</span> as evidencing <span class="underline">Howey&#8217;s</span> “expectation of profits.” <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I13202b1079bf11d9ac1ffa9f33b6c3b0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_54">SG Ltd., 265 F.3d at 54-55</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>LBRY does not disavow its statements regarding LBC&#8217;s value or price, but notes that the statements the SEC identifies constitute only 0.25% of “the total number of posts and messages the company has published since its inception.” <span class="underline">See</span> Def.'s Obj., <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845">Doc. No. 74</a> at 5. But this statistic relies on a misleading denominator. Of course, like many other companies, LBRY regularly publishes statements on a range of topics, and could not argue that the 8,805 tweets it identified having posted, <span class="underline">see</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845">id.</a>, all pertain in equal measure to its views of LBC&#8217;s long-term value proposition. Since LBRY makes no effort to tally the number of comparable statements to those identified by the SEC, its argument lacks weight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>LBRY also relies on the fact that it informed some potential purchasers of LBC that the company was not offering its token as an investment. But a disclaimer cannot undo the objective economic realities of a transaction. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I4ba864e06e4411eaafc9a4147037e074/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_7903_365">SEC v.

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>2&period; LBRY&#8217;s Business Model</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>As I just laid out, LBRY made no secret in its communications with potential investors that it expected LBC to grow in value through its managerial and entrepreneurial efforts. But even if it had never explicitly broadcast its views on the subject, any reasonable investor who was familiar with the company&#8217;s business model would have understood the connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>From its inception, LBRY&#8217;s profitability turned on its ability to grow the value of LBC by increasing usage of the LBRY Network. As Kauffman explained in an October 2016 informal business plan, LBC was the means by which LBRY and other early adopters would be able to profit as use of the network increased. <span class="underline">See</span> LBRY Plan, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030">Doc. No. 62-2</a> at 9. This was because “[e]ach percentage of [LBC] can be thought of as having a value proportional to the sum of all information transacted through the network.” <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030">Id.</a> In other words, as demand for information stored on the blockchain increased, so too would LBC&#8217;s value. Accordingly, Kauffman reasoned, “[g]iven this situation, the most reasonable path to profit is to reserve a portion of the cryptocurrency.” <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030">Id.</a> Later in the same plan, he discussed the company&#8217;s liquidation value by stating “[s]ince LBRY&#8217;s most significant asset will be its credits, it could simply liquify these credits at a return of 10-10,000x on any investment.” <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030">Id.</a> at 10.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Similarly, in a post on its website titled “Answers to Big Questions From our Reddit AMA,” LBRY responded to the question “How does the company behind LBRY make money?” by stating:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p><span class="quoteblock"><code><em>"The LBRY protocol has a built-in digital currency that allows it to function, called LBRY Credits. These Credits are very similar to bitcoins. Having a built-in digital currency creates an opportunity for a new kind of business that has never existed: the protocolfirst enterprise . . . LBRY Inc. has reserved 10% of all LBRY Credits to fund continued development and provide profit for the founders. Since Credits only gain value as the use of the protocol grows, the company has an incentive to continue developing this open-source project."</em></code></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>9/28/2016 LBRY Article, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791450">Doc. No. 57-8</a>.<br/></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The problem for LBRY is not just that a reasonable purchaser of LBC would understand that the tokens being offered represented investment opportunities - even if LBRY never said a word about it. It is that, by retaining hundreds of millions of LBC for itself, LBRY also signaled that it was motivated to work tirelessly to improve the value of its blockchain for itself and any LBC purchasers. This structure, which any reasonable purchaser would understand, would lead purchasers of LBC to expect that they too would profit from their holdings of LBC as a result of LBRY&#8217;s assiduous efforts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Simply put, by intertwining LBRY&#8217;s financial fate with the commercial success of LBC, LBRY made it obvious to its investors that it would work diligently to develop the Network so that LBC would increase in value. As LBRY said, “[o]ver the long-term, the interests of LBRY and the holders of Credits are aligned.” <span class="underline">See</span> 7/15/2016 LBRY Article, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">Doc. No. 57-11</a>. The SEC&#8217;s burden is made all the easier by statements LBRY made about its managerial efforts, like how “the long-term value proposition of LBRY is . . . dependent on our team staying focused on the task at hand: building this thing.” <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">id.</a> By its own account, LBRY expended significant managerial efforts to develop its Network and increase the value of LBC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>3&period; Consumptive Uses for LBC</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>LBRY&#8217;s primary response to the SEC&#8217;s claim starts with two generally uncontested facts: (1) LBC is a utility token designed for use on the LBRY Blockchain, and (2) some unknown number of purchasers of LBC acquired it at least in part with the intention of using it rather than holding it as an investment. Building from there, LBRY leaps to the conclusion that LBC cannot be a security even if LBRY offered it as an investment. LBRY is mistaken about both the facts and the law.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Nothing in the case law suggests that a token with both consumptive and speculative uses cannot be sold as an investment contract. Despite LBRY&#8217;s insistence to the contrary, I cannot reject the SEC&#8217;s contention that LBRY offered LBC as a security simply because some LBC purchases were made with consumptive intent. Were it otherwise, the Securities Act would be unable to adapt to the “countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits” wherever a token held some consumptive utility. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I22292b4f9bf011d993e6d35cc61aab4a/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_780_299">Howey, 328 U.S.</a> at 299.
Accordingly, statements from a subset of LBC holders that they purchased LBC for use on the LBRY Blockchain is of limited relevance in determining whether LBRY offered it as a security. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I14265fa660e511deb08de1b7506ad85b/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_1021">Warfield, 569 F.3d</a> at 1021 (“[W]hile the subjective intent of the purchasers may have some bearing on the issue of whether they entered into investment contracts, we must focus our inquiry on what the purchasers were offered or promised.”).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In summary, what the evidence in the record discloses is that LBRY promoted LBC as an investment that would grow in value over time through the company&#8217;s development of the LBRY Network. While some unknown number of purchasers may have acquired LBC in part for consumptive purposes, this does not change the fact that the objective economic realities of LBRY&#8217;s offerings of LBC establish that it was offering it as a security.<a href="#sec_v_lbry_footnote_4"><strong><sup><em>(4)</em></sup></strong></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>B&period; Did LBRY Receive Fair Notice?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>LBRY argues that I should nonetheless deny the SEC&#8217;s motion because it did not receive fair notice that its offerings were subject to the securities laws. In pressing this argument, LBRY has abandoned any broad claim that it lacked fair notice of the way in which the <span class="underline">Howey</span> test applies to digital tokens in general. Def.'s Obj., <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845">Doc. No. 74</a> at 24. Instead, it complains that it lacked fair notice because, until the SEC brought this action, “the Commission historically and consistently focused its guidance, as well as its enforcement efforts, exclusively on the issuance of digital assets in the context of an [Initial Coin Offering] ICO.” <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845">Id.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The principal problem with LBRY&#8217;s fair notice argument is that it offers nothing more to support its position than its bald claim that this is the first case in which the SEC has attempted to enforce the registration requirement against an issuer of digital tokens that did not conduct an ICO.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>LBRY does not point to any specific statement by the SEC suggesting that companies need only comply with the registration requirement if they conduct an ICO. Nor does LBRY offer any persuasive reading of <span class="underline">Howey</span> that would cause a reasonable issuer to conclude that only ICOs are subject to the registration requirement. The test outlined in <span class="underline">Howey</span> is necessarily a factspecific one, in which no single fact will likely be dispositive. While participation in an ICO may be relevant to the analysis, it will not determine the outcome in a case like this, where the undisputed evidence leaves no doubt that LBRY offered and sold LBC as a security.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>LBRY relies on the Second Circuit&#8217;s decision in <span class="underline">Upton v. SEC</span> for the proposition that the SEC may not impose a sanction for violating the securities laws “pursuant to a substantial change in its enforcement policy that was not reasonably communicated to the public.” <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_98">75 F.3d 92, 98 (2nd Cir. 1996)</a>. But, as the SEC notes, the facts of <span class="underline">Upton</span> bear no resemblance to the present case. <span class="underline">Upton</span> involved an attempt by the SEC to sanction the CFO of a brokerage firm for violating an SEC rule that established a formula for setting the amount of money that the brokerage was required to maintain in a customer reserve account. <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_93">Id.</a> at 93. Although it was undisputed that the brokerage had at all times complied with the “literal terms” of the rule, an administrative law judge relied on a novel interpretation of the rule by the SEC to conclude that the CFO could be sanctioned. <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_94">Id.</a> at 94-96. Because the SEC did not give public notice of its new interpretation until after the brokerage had ended its offensive practice, the Second Circuit vacated the sanction imposed by the Commission. <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_94">Id.</a> at 98.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The present case is obviously quite different from the problem the court confronted in <span class="underline">Upton</span>. The SEC has not based its enforcement action here on a novel interpretation of a rule that by its terms does not expressly prohibit the relevant conduct. Instead, the SEC has based its claim on a straightforward application of a venerable Supreme Court precedent that has been applied by hundreds of federal courts across the country over more than 70 years. While this may be the first time it has been used against an issuer of digital tokens that did not conduct an ICO, LBRY is in no position to claim that it did not receive fair notice that its conduct was unlawful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><strong>IV&period; <span class="underline">CONCLUSION</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>As I have explained, the only issues raised by the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment are whether LBRY offered LBC as a security and whether LBRY received fair notice that it needed to register its offerings. Because no reasonable trier of fact could reject the SEC&#8217;s contention that LBRY offered LBC as a security, and LBRY does not have a triable defense that it lacked fair notice, the SEC is entitled to judgment. The SEC&#8217;s Motion for Summary J udgment (<a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791412">Doc. No. 55</a>) is granted, and LBRY&#8217;s Motion for Summary Judgment (<a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791679">Doc. No. 61</a>) is denied. The Clerk shall schedule a status conference to discuss the process for resolving any remaining issues.</p>

<p>Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission” or “SEC”) files this Complaint against Genesis Global Capital, LLC (“Genesis”) and Gemini Trust Company, LLC (“Gemini”) (collectively, “Defendants”) and alleges as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Between February 2021 and November 2022, Genesis and Gemini engaged in an unregistered offer and sale of securities to U.S. retail investors, in violation of the federal securities laws. Through an investment opportunity that Defendants called the “Gemini Earn” program, investors tendered crypto assets to Genesis and, in exchange, Genesis promised to pay interest on those assets to investors. Through this unregistered offering, Defendants raised billions of dollars’ worth of crypto assets, principally from U.S. retail investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both Defendants were integral to the operation and success of the Gemini Earn program. Genesis was the issuer and entity that received, pooled, deployed, and paid interest on investors’ assets. Genesis and Gemini marketed the Gemini Earn program through social media and Gemini’s website, touting the high interest rates that investors could earn through Gemini Earn. And Gemini provided retail investors with access to Genesis, which otherwise only engaged in crypto asset transactions with large institutional and other accredited investors.<a href="#sec_genesis_footnote_1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a> Crucially, both Defendants profited from the partnership and offering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To participate in the Gemini Earn program, Genesis and Gemini required that investors enter into a tri-party Master Digital Asset Loan Agreement with Genesis and Gemini (“Gemini Earn Agreement”), whereby Gemini Earn investors provided crypto assets to Genesis, with Gemini acting as the agent in the issuance. Genesis would send interest payments to Gemini, which would then deduct an “Agent Fee” before distributing the remainder of the interest payments to Gemini Earn investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genesis pooled the crypto assets from Gemini Earn investors with assets from other investors. Genesis then deployed the crypto assets – primarily by lending the crypto assets to institutional counterparties (“Institutional Borrowers”) – in order to generate revenue for its business, including the revenue necessary to pay interest to Gemini Earn investors. Genesis earned revenue by lending the crypto assets at a higher rate than it paid to Gemini Earn and other investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Genesis Earn Agreements, as offered and sold through the Gemini Earn program, were securities that Genesis and Gemini offered and sold to the investing public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants offered and sold the Gemini Earn Agreements through the Gemini Earn Program without registering the offer and sale with the SEC as required by the federal securities laws. As a result, investors lacked material information about the Gemini Earn program that would have been relevant to their investment decisions. Instead of providing investors with the full panoply of information required by the federal securities laws, Defendants have instead only made selective and inadequate disclosures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The U.S. retail investors who participated in the Gemini Earn program have suffered significant harm. In November 2022, Genesis unilaterally announced that it would not allow hundreds of thousands of retail investors to withdraw their crypto assets from Gemini Earn because of “withdrawal requests which have exceeded our current liquidity” following volatility in the crypto asset market. At the time, Genesis held approximately $900 million in investor assets from approximately 340,000 Gemini Earn investors, most residing in the United States. As of the date of this Complaint, these retail investors still cannot withdraw their assets, and Genesis has formed a special committee to oversee a restructuring process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the Gemini Earn program has been terminated, both Genesis and Gemini continue to do business in the crypto asset industry. In particular, Genesis intends to reengage in crypto asset lending activities. Gemini continues to hold billions of dollars’ worth of crypto assets on behalf of retail investors in connection with its trading platform and other activity in this industry. Thus, Defendants remain positioned to violate the registration provisions if they are not enjoined from doing so.</p>

<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="18">
<li>
<p>The Securities Act sets forth a longstanding regime of full and fair disclosure in connection with the offer and sale of securities, in contrast to traditional commercial principles of caveat emptor. Congress mandated that persons who offer and sell securities to the investing public provide sufficient, accurate information to allow investors to make informed decisions before they invest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The definition of a “security” under the Securities Act includes a wide range of investment vehicles, including “investment contracts” and “notes.” An investment contract is an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. Congress defined “security” broadly to embody a “flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.” SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 299 (1946). According to the Supreme Court, the broad definition of “security” is “sufficient to encompass virtually any instrument that might be sold as an investment,” because “Congress’ purpose in enacting the securities laws was to regulate investments, in whatever form they are made and by whatever name they are called.” SEC v. Edwards, 540 U.S. 389, 393 (2004) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original). Courts have found that novel or unique investment vehicles constitute investment contracts, including interests in orange groves, animal breeding programs, railroads, mobile phones, and enterprises that exist only on the Internet, including crypto assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act require that an issuer like Genesis register the offer or sale of securities with the SEC. Similarly, those provisions prohibit Gemini from engaging in the offer and sale of such unregistered securities. Registration statements relating to an offering of securities provide public investors with material information about the issuer and the offering, including but not limited to financial and managerial information, how the issuer will use offering proceeds, and the risks and trends that affect the enterprise and an investment in its securities.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>BACKGROUND ON CRYPTO ASSETS</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="21">
<li>
<p>The term “crypto asset” generally refers to an asset that is issued and transferred using distributed ledger or blockchain technology, including, but not limited to, so-called “cryptocurrencies,” “coins,” and “tokens.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A blockchain or distributed ledger is a peer-to-peer database spread across a network of computers that records all transactions in theoretically unchangeable, digitally recorded data packages. The system relies on cryptographic techniques for secure recording of transactions.</p>

<p><span class="underline"><strong>Genesis and Gemini Offered and Sold Investments</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="23">
<li>
<p>In March 2018, Genesis began obtaining crypto assets from large institutional and other accredited investors in exchange for a promise to pay interest on those investors’ crypto assets. Genesis obtained crypto assets from its various investors for the use of its primary business – i.e., to lend crypto assets to Institutional Borrowers for interest – which generated revenue for Genesis and allowed it to pay interest to large institutional and other accredited investors. Genesis earned profit by lending the crypto assets to Institutional Borrowers at a higher rate than it paid to its investors. Genesis pooled the investors’ crypto assets and exercised discretion over how to deploy the assets to earn income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually, Genesis expanded its business model to transact with not just institutional and accredited investors, but also retail investors. In particular, in December 2020, Genesis entered into an agreement with Gemini to offer Gemini customers, including U.S. retail investors, an opportunity to tender their crypto assets to Genesis in exchange for Genesis’ promise to pay interest.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><strong>Gemini Earn Program</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="25">
<li>
<p>Specifically, beginning in February 2021, Genesis and Gemini began offering the Gemini Earn program to retail investors in the United States and Hong Kong, and later Singapore. There was no minimum investment amount to be eligible to participate in the Gemini Earn program. As of November 16, 2022, approximately 340,000 retail investors, most residing in the United States, had crypto assets invested with Genesis through the Gemini Earn program. By November 2022, the value of retail investors’ crypto assets held by Gemini exceeded the collective value of those tendered by institutional and accredited investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each Gemini Earn investor entered into a tri-party Gemini Earn Agreement with Gemini and Genesis. The agreement was a standard agreement and not individually negotiated with Gemini Earn investors. Under the terms of the Gemini Earn Agreement, Gemini Earn investors first needed to hold eligible crypto assets with Gemini – either by transferring the crypto assets to Gemini or acquiring them via Gemini’s crypto asset trading platform. Through Gemini Earn, investors would then tender their crypto assets to Genesis, with Gemini acting as the agent for retail investors to facilitate the transaction. Gemini aggregated the crypto assets to be invested in the Gemini Earn program and placed them in a digital wallet from which Genesis would take possession of the assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genesis determined the types and aggregate amount of each crypto asset that were eligible to be invested by Gemini Earn investors. Genesis offered and agreed to pay the Gemini Earn investors in-kind interest on the crypto assets they had invested, which accrued on a daily basis. Genesis could unilaterally revise the interest rates and the aggregate amount of each crypto asset that Gemini Earn investors could invest, on a monthly basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gemini Earn investors’ returns came from Genesis, with Gemini deducting an Agent Fee from the returns. Genesis had sole discretion over the gross interest rate that it paid for each crypto asset, while Gemini had sole discretion over its Agent Fee and thus the net rates of return offered to Gemini Earn investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gemini published the list of crypto assets eligible for investment and the interest rates offered to Gemini Earn investors on its website as well as in Gemini’s mobile application (“app”). More than 50 crypto assets were eligible to be invested in the Gemini Earn program, including Bitcoin, Ether, USD Coin, and Dogecoin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As of October 2022, the net interest rate offered to Gemini Earn investors ranged from 0.45% to 8.05%, while Gemini’s Agent Fee ranged from 0.06% to 4.29%, depending on the type of crypto asset tendered to Genesis. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, Gemini received approximately $2.7 million in Agent Fees from the Gemini Earn program. 31. The Gemini Earn Agreement provided that the crypto asset transactions were “open term” unless otherwise specified, and Gemini Earn investors could terminate all, or a portion, of their investment in Gemini Earn at any time with no withdrawal fee. Per the Gemini Earn Agreement, Genesis was also obligated to return the invested crypto assets within three business days of an investor’s request for repayment to a digital wallet controlled by Gemini, and Gemini would then transfer the crypto assets and any accrued interest to the investor’s Gemini account where the assets and interest would be available for withdrawal. The Gemini Earn Agreement also provided that Genesis was responsible for repaying the crypto assets and all accrued interest to the Gemini Earn investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the terms of the Gemini Earn Agreement, a failure by Genesis to return crypto assets or a failure by Genesis to pay interest or late fees to a Gemini Earn investor is considered an event of default. In the event of a default, Gemini may declare the entire Gemini Earn balance payable, transfer any collateral to hold on behalf of itself and the Gemini Earn investors, and/or exercise all other rights and remedies available. If the event of default persists for 30 days or more, Gemini may terminate the Gemini Earn Agreement.</p>
</li>

<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><strong>Genesis and Gemini Promoted Gemini Earn as an Investment</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="33">
<li>
<p>Genesis and Gemini both touted the profits investors could earn by investing their crypto assets with Genesis through Gemini Earn. Genesis advertised on its public website that “[h]olders of digital currencies can earn yield on their assets by lending directly to Genesis.” Genesis also published tweets highlighting its partnership with Gemini and the yield that Gemini Earn investors – i.e., retail investors – could earn. For example, on February 2, 2021, Genesis published a tweet stating, “Genesis is dedicated to building and partnering to lower barriers to digital asset markets.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gemini similarly promoted the profit that investors could earn through the Gemini Earn program. In a February 2021 press release launching Gemini Earn, Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss stated, “We designed a program that allows our customers the ability to generate a real return on their crypto holdings.” On February 27, 2021, Gemini also posted a video on YouTube titled, “Invest Better with Gemini Earn.” On its website, Gemini described how users would earn interest, noting, “We are excited to launch Gemini Earn and offer more opportunities for you to grow your portfolio and earn yield.” Similarly, Gemini advertised on its website that investors could “[p]ut your crypto to work. With Gemini Earn, you can receive up to 8.05% APY on your cryptocurrency,” and listed the interest rate that investors could earn for each eligible crypto asset. Gemini also published tweets, including on May 26, 2021, promoting the high interest rates offered via Gemini Earn, with statements such as the following:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="35">
<li>
<p>Gemini itself repeatedly described Gemini Earn as an investment on its website. For example, Gemini included this description in an FAQ entitled, “What are the risks of Gemini Earn?”:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">Cryptocurrency, like many assets, can be volatile and subject to price swings. There is always a risk in <span class="underline">investing</span>, and each customer needs to assess their own risk tolerance before making any <span class="underline">investment decisions</span>. Our partners in Gemini Earn have an obligation to return funds according to the terms of their loan agreement. However, Gemini Earn customers (the lenders) always assume some level of risk when they decide to lend their funds. We believe Gemini Earn gives our retail investors another way to stay long-term in the asset class and have the <span class="underline">option to invest and earn interest</span>, all on the Gemini platform.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gemini’s website also claimed that Gemini Earn investors could “receive more than 100x the average national interest rate, among the highest rates on the market” and that Gemini Earn “offer[s] more flexibility than other yield-generating cryptocurrency investments.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, Gemini’s website featured a calculator that would allow a user to select a deposit amount, crypto asset type, and a time frame to see how much interest could be earned by tendering crypto assets through Gemini Earn. The calculator would reveal the projected amount of interest that could be earned by investing the investor’s crypto assets for a period between one and four years.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><strong>Genesis’ Deployment of the Invested Gemini Earn Crypto Assets</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="38">
<li>
<p>Genesis pooled on its balance sheet the crypto assets that it received from the Gemini Earn investors and other investors, and in practice did not segregate the crypto assets it received from different groups of investors. Genesis retained possession and control over the investors’ crypto assets on its balance sheet, and determined how much to hold, lend out to others, and otherwise use. Genesis exercised its discretion in how to use investors’ crypto assets to generate revenue for its business and to pay the interest rates it promised Gemini Earn investors and other investors. The Gemini Earn Agreement did not contain any explicit terms restricting how investors’ crypto assets would be used by Genesis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generally, Genesis deployed the Gemini Earn investors’ crypto assets by either lending them to Institutional Borrowers or using the assets as collateral for Genesis’ own borrowing. Crypto assets not loaned to Institutional Borrowers or used for collateral were held by Genesis on its balance sheet in an effort to provide Genesis with liquidity to meet potential demand for loans as well as to repay the investors in its crypto asset program, including Gemini Earn. Genesis also had the ability to loan the crypto assets to related parties, including its parent company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genesis employed its discretion and judgment in determining the terms of transactions with Institutional Borrowers. For example, Genesis conducted due diligence on the Institutional Borrowers before entering into a transaction. Genesis negotiated an initial agreement with each Institutional Borrower, and then individually negotiated the terms – including the type of crypto assets to be lent, interest rate, duration of the loan, and collateral (if any) – of every subsequent lending transaction. Genesis separately evaluated each Institutional Borrower, as well as market conditions, when determining collateral rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The returns earned by each Gemini Earn investor were reliant on the pooling of the invested crypto assets and the ways in which Genesis deployed those assets, including Genesis’ evaluation of the Institutional Borrowers, negotiation of favorable terms, and management of market and counterparty risk. When Genesis loaned crypto assets it received through the Gemini Earn program, the assets were transferred to the Institutional Borrowers and left Genesis’ balance sheet. Ultimately, the returns of Gemini Earn investors were dependent on Genesis’ managerial efforts and risk management in its lending activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interest income that Genesis received from lending crypto assets to Institutional Borrowers was used to generate revenue for Genesis and to pay the promised interest to Gemini Earn investors and other investors. Genesis did not have any other revenue-generating activities. For example, for the three months ended March 31, 2022, Genesis received approximately $169.8 million in interest income from Institutional Borrowers and paid $166.2 million in interest to the investors in its crypto asset program, including Gemini Earn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genesis also loaned an additional $575 million worth of crypto assets, including those of Gemini Earn investors, to related party DCG, which DCG used to fund investment opportunities and repurchase DCG stock from non-employee shareholders in secondary transactions.</p>

<p>Under Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act, the definition of a security includes any “note.” See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77b, 78c. A note is presumed to be a security unless it bears a strong resemblance to instruments that are not securities, which courts determine by examining four factors: (1) the motivation of the parties; (2) the plan of distribution; (3) the expectations of the investing public; and (4) the availability of an alternative regulatory regime that “significantly reduces the risk of the instrument” for investors other than the securities laws, “thereby rendering application of the Securities Acts unnecessary.” See Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, 494 U.S. 56, 64–69 (1990). Under Reves, the Gemini Earn Agreements were notes and offered and sold through Gemini Earn as securities.</p>

<p><strong>The Purpose of the Gemini Earn Program</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="45">
<li>
<p>Genesis offered the Gemini Earn program to obtain crypto assets for the use of its business – namely, to run its institutional lending activities, generate profits for itself, and to pay the interest promised to Genesis investors, and investors in Gemini Earn were primarily interested in the profit they expected the program to generate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genesis controlled the crypto assets it obtained from investors and had complete discretion in determining how much to hold, lend and otherwise use. Genesis used the crypto assets it raised from Gemini Earn investors and other investors to make loans to Institutional Borrowers or as collateral for Genesis’ own borrowing. Genesis also had the discretion to hold the assets on its balance sheet to provide Genesis with liquidity to meet potential demand for loans as well as to repay the investors in its crypto asset program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In turn, investors participated in the Gemini Earn program primarily for profit, i.e., to receive a return on their crypto assets. Genesis and Gemini both touted the profits investors could earn by investing their crypto assets with Genesis, including by advertising Gemini Earn as an investment and touting that investors could receive up to 8.05% annual percentage yield (“APY”) on their crypto assets. Investors who purchased the Gemini Earn notes were led to expect that by tendering and giving control over their crypto assets to Genesis, they would receive profit in the form of interest on those assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In short, Genesis intended to use the crypto assets for its business and its sole source of revenue, and the Gemini Earn investors were primarily motivated to earn a profit on their crypto assets in the form of interest.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>The Gemini Earn Program was Offered and Sold to a Broad Segment of the Public</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="49">
<li>
<p>Genesis and Gemini publicly advertised the Gemini Earn Agreements, through Gemini Earn, on websites and on social media. Moreover, the Gemini Earn Agreements were offered and sold to any U.S. investor, including retail investors. As of November 16, 2022, there were approximately 340,000 retail investors, the majority of whom resided in the United States, who had crypto assets invested with Genesis through the Gemini Earn program. The Gemini Earn Agreements were offered and sold to a broad segment of the general public.</p>

</ol>

<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>The Investing Public Considered these Notes as Investments</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="50">
<li>
<p>Genesis and Gemini, through websites and social media, promoted Gemini Earn as an investment, specifically as a way to earn high “returns” or “yield” on investors’ crypto assets. Gemini repeatedly described Gemini Earn as an investment on its own website and social media and repeatedly touted that the Gemini Earn interest rates were “among the highest rates on the market” and “higher than most existing options.” Gemini’s website further claimed that Gemini Earn investors could “receive more than 100x the national interest rate.” Gemini’s website also included a calculator that showed a user potentially how much interest they could earn by investing their crypto assets in the Gemini Earn program for a period between one and four years. The economic realities of the transaction, in which investors had an opportunity to tender crypto assets with Genesis in exchange for earning interest with some of the “highest rates” available for crypto assets, further underscore why the investing public considered the Gemini Earn program to be an investment opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>No Alternative Regulatory Regime or Risk-Reducing Factors Exist to Protect Gemini Earn Investors</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="51">
<li>
<p>No alternative regulatory scheme or risk-reducing factors existed to protect investors with respect to the Gemini Earn program. In its own FAQs, Genesis noted that “[D]igital assets are not covered by SIPC insurance” and that “[e]stablishing a lending and borrowing relationship with Genesis is not the same as opening a depository account or a savings account” and that “[a]ccounts with Genesis do not enjoy FDIC protection.” Genesis Global Trading, Inc., the SEC registered broker-dealer affiliated with Genesis, did not have a role in the Gemini Earn program. Although Genesis has registered as a money services business (“MSB”) with FinCEN, the anti-money laundering and recording keeping and reporting requirements of an MSB – designed to prevent money services business from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities – do not provide the significant disclosures and other investor protections afforded by the federal securities laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, although Gemini is registered with NYSDFS as a New York limited purpose trust company, NYSDFS did not have oversight over Genesis. Gemini publicly stated that Gemini Earn does not operate like a traditional bank account, is not protected by a governmental program, and is not backed by Gemini itself. In a February 2021 press release launching Gemini Earn, Gemini stated that “Gemini Earn is not a depository account. . . . Loans are not insured by Gemini or any governmental program or institution.” Likewise, on its website, Gemini noted that “Gemini Earn is structured similarly to non-deposit services offered by financial institutions and not insured by FDIC, SIPC, any other governmental program, or Gemini.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any capital reserve requirements applicable to Gemini did not apply to Genesis or to the crypto assets tendered to Genesis through Gemini Earn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the terms of the Gemini Earn Agreement, Genesis was not required to post collateral. Gemini told investors, “All lending by you through our Program will be on an unsecured basis. We will not collect or hold collateral from Borrowers, nor maintain any collateral account for your benefit.” Although Genesis later provided some collateral to Gemini in August 2022, the collateral Genesis provided to Gemini was in the form of restricted shares that could not be liquidated immediately and amounted to only a fraction of the total investor assets held in Gemini Earn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As evidenced by the current state of Gemini Earn, where investors have been unable to access their crypto assets or any form of collateral since November 16, 2022, any oversight of Genesis as an MSB and Gemini as a limited purpose trust company did not adequately reduce the risk of significant harm to Gemini Earn retail investors.</p>

<p><strong>Gemini Earn Investors and Defendants Invested in a Common Enterprise</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="58">
<li>
<p>Investors in Gemini Earn invested in a common enterprise with other investors and with Defendants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genesis pooled Gemini Earn investors’ and other investors’ crypto assets on Genesis’ balance sheet, and used those assets in order to generate returns for both Genesis and investors, including Gemini Earn investors. Genesis did not manage individual or separate accounts for each investor in Gemini Earn. Instead, the returns earned by each investor were reliant on the pooling of the invested crypto assets. As the invested crypto assets were not segregated in any way by Genesis, each investor’s fortune was tied to the fortunes of the other investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gemini Earn investors’ fortunes were also tied to Genesis’ fortunes; both Genesis and Gemini Earn investors earned profits when Genesis deployed the pooled assets. Moreover, Genesis’ current situation, where it has experienced withdrawal requests that exceed its current liquidity and has consequently restricted Gemini Earn investors from withdrawing their crypto assets and begun a restructuring process, further demonstrates that the fortunes of Genesis and the fortunes of each Gemini Earn investor are tied to one another in a common enterprise.</p>

<p><strong>Gemini Earn Investors Reasonably Expected to Profit From the Efforts of Defendants</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="61">
<li>
<p>Investors in the Gemini Earn program reasonably expected to profit from the efforts of Defendants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From its inception, Defendants have explicitly marketed the Gemini Earn program as an investment opportunity which led investors to reasonably expect to profit from their efforts. As detailed above, through their websites and social media channels, both Genesis and Gemini publicly touted the ability for investors to earn yield or returns via Gemini Earn. Gemini repeatedly itself described Gemini Earn as an investment on its own website; repeatedly touted that the Gemini Earn interest rates were “among the highest rates on the market” and that Gemini Earn investors could “receive more than 100x the national interest rate”; and Gemini’s website illustrated how much interest Gemini Earn investors could potentially earn by investing their crypto assets for a period between one and four years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genesis also described itself as the “premier institutional digital asset financial services firm,” and “the world’s largest digital asset lender” and that “[h]olders of digital currencies can earn yield on their assets by lending directly to Genesis, a regulated and trusted counterparty.” Accordingly, Gemini Earn investors were led to expect that Defendants’ efforts to generate the investment returns – i.e., the promised interest – would result in profit for investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of the Gemini Earn Agreements, investors ceded control over their crypto assets to Genesis, who has complete discretion in deploying the crypto assets. Genesis, not investors, undertook various complex tasks of pooling Gemini Earn crypto assets, identifying Institutional Borrowers to serve as counterparties, negotiating individual agreements with those counterparties, and managing market and counterparty risk. Investors understood that Genesis would conduct due diligence on Institutional Borrowers and evaluate market conditions in determining the appropriate collateral levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, the economic realities of the Gemini Earn program demonstrate that Genesis was motivated to use its experience and skill as the “premier institutional digital asset financial services firm” and its economic power as “the world’s largest digital asset lender ” to select appropriate Institutional Borrowers to serve as counterparties, negotiate for the highest interest rates from those Institutional Borrowers, and set appropriate collateral levels, in order to generate maximum profit for itself. Defendants’ efforts were essential to the success or failure of the enterprise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investors understood that, on a monthly basis, the interest rate for their Gemini Earn investments would be revised by Genesis, reflecting Genesis’ ongoing managerial efforts to pay among “the highest rates in the market.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants’ statements and actions, and the economic reality of the Gemini Earn program, have led reasonable investors to expect Genesis to undertake significant and essential technical, managerial, and entrepreneurial efforts on their behalf, and investors in the Gemini Earn program reasonably expected to profit from those efforts.</p>

Gemini Earn investors also had limited or inadequate information about Genesis’ operations, financial condition, liquidity, or other factors relevant in considering whether to invest in the Gemini Earn program. Investors also lacked full and detailed information regarding how Genesis deploys their crypto assets, including its exposure to volatility in crypto asset markets, the financial condition of Genesis’ counterparties and the amount of collateral Genesis obtained, if any, as part of its loans to Institutional Borrowers. In short, Gemini Earn investors lacked information that issuers provide under the Securities Act when they solicit public investment.</p>

<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>In or around June 2020, Nexo Capital Inc. (“Nexo”) began to offer and sell the so-called Nexo Earn Interest Product (“EIP”) in the United States. The EIP allowed United States investors to tender to Nexo certain crypto assets, which Nexo deposited in interest- yielding accounts and then used in various ways to generate income for its own business and to fund interest payments to EIP investors. These included staking, lending, and engaging in arbitrage on purportedly “decentralized” finance platforms; investing in certain crypto assets; loaning funds to retail and institutional borrowers; and entering into options and swap contracts with respect to the crypto assets tendered. As of March 2022, Nexo’s EIP had approximately 112,000 U.S. investors and $2.7 billion in assets from U.S. investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the facts and circumstances set forth below, Nexo offered and sold securities in the form of investment contracts and notes. Nexo offered and sold the EIP to a broad segment of the general public to obtain crypto assets for general use in its business. Nexo obtained the crypto assets in exchange for a promise to pay them back, with interest. Investors in the EIP had a reasonable expectation of obtaining a future profit from Nexo’s efforts in managing the EIP, including based on Nexo’s statements about how the EIP was a tool investors could use to generate wealth. Investors also had a reasonable expectation that Nexo would use the invested crypto assets in Nexo’s lending and principal investing activity, and that investors would share profits in the form of interest payments in direct proportion to their investments, as a result of Nexo’s managerial and entrepreneurial efforts. Notably, Nexo promoted the EIP as an investment, by which investors could earn a consistent return. Nexo took complete control over investors’ assets from the EIP, pooled them together, including with Nexo’s other assets, and then deployed those assets in various revenue- generating activities. Additionally, Nexo’s lending and investment activities were at its own discretion, and Nexo was responsible for managing the risks involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nexo offered and sold securities without a registration statement filed or in effect with the Commission and without qualifying for an exemption from registration. As a result, Nexo violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.</p>

<li>
<p>Nexo Capital Inc. (“Nexo”) is a Cayman Islands corporation formed in 2018 with its principal place of business in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands. Nexo provides crypto asset-related financial products and services, including purchasing, lending, borrowing, trading, and storing. Nexo is part of the Nexo Group, which is comprised of other Nexo entities that are primarily incorporated in various European countries.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><strong><span class="underline">Facts</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="5">
<li>
<p>Since 2018, Nexo has conducted a crypto asset business globally and in the United States through Nexo’s public website <a href="http://www.nexo.io" class="bare">http://www.nexo.io</a> and through a mobile application, both of which were accessible at all relevant times from within the United States. The business has included crypto asset-related financial products and services, including the EIP (discussed further below); the “Borrow Product,” by which customers could borrow crypto assets; the “Nexo Exchange,” through which customers could trade certain crypto assets; and storage for crypto assets. As of March 2022, Nexo had 3.7 million global users and $13.7 billion in global assets across its entire platform for the various services it offered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In or around June 2020, Nexo began to offer and sell the EIP in the United States. To invest in the EIP, investors provided crypto assets to Nexo in exchange for Nexo’s promise to provide a variable interest payment. Per its description to investors, Nexo determined the interest rate based upon, among other things, the specific crypto asset provided to Nexo by the investor and the duration of time the investor committed to maintaining the asset with Nexo. The longer the time period, the higher the interest rate. Investors began accruing interest 24 hours after tendering eligible crypto assets, with interest calculated daily and compounded for interest earned in-kind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nexo offered the EIP under flexible and fixed terms. Under flexible terms, there was no holding period and investors could withdraw their crypto assets and earned interest at any time. Under fixed terms, investors were unable to withdraw their crypto assets and interest for the duration of the defined term. Interest accrued in connection with the EIP was credited to investors’ accounts at the expiration of the fixed term, if applicable, or otherwise daily. Investors were able to withdraw all or part of the crypto assets they invested with Nexo, including the interest earned, by instructing Nexo to transfer the crypto assets to the investor’s personal “digital wallet” (generally, a unique address within a cryptographically-secured ledger used to “hold” crypto assets) or by instructing Nexo to sell the relevant crypto assets in exchange for fiat currency such as U.S. Dollars, and then transferring the U.S. Dollar proceeds to a selected bank account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The investor assets tendered through the EIP were for Nexo’s general use in its business, namely in lending and investment activities, which generated income for Nexo and its investors. Nexo pooled the loaned assets from the EIP together with other Nexo assets and exercised full discretion over how to use the pooled assets. Nexo retained possession and control over the tendered crypto assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Terms and Conditions for the EIP provided the following:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">[Investors] understand and agree that we might convert, pledge, re-pledge, hypothecate, rehypothecate, sell, lend, or otherwise transfer, dispose of or use any amount of any Digital Assets in regard to which you use the Nexo Earn Interest Product, separately or together with other property, and for any period of time, and without retaining in our possession and/or control for delivery a like amount thereof or any other assets, at our sole and absolute discretion. Any such action will be performed in our name only and you will have no benefits and liabilities from it.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nexo pooled the assets tendered through the EIP with other assets, and used the asset pool to engage in various revenue-generating activities, including staking, lending, arbitrage, and earning interest on certain purportedly “decentralized” finance platforms by providing liquidity; investing in certain crypto assets; offering crypto credit lines (i.e., loans to retail and institutional borrowers); and entering into options and swap contracts. Nexo relied on the revenue generated from the foregoing activities to fund interest payments to EIP investors and to generate income and profits for Nexo itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nexo marketed the EIP to U.S. investors through general solicitations on its website, the Nexo mobile application, and on social media and elsewhere online, including on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Nexo promoted the EIP as an investment and profit-making opportunity. For example, Nexo advertised the attractive interest rates offered through the EIP as a way to “grow your wealth.” It highlighted on its website that investors could earn “up to 12% annual interest.” Nexo also promoted the EIP as an investment opportunity on Twitter. For example, in a March 30, 2021 tweet, titled “Why Nexo #1: HODLing [sic]+ Growing Your Investments,” Nexo linked to additional information on its website to “Learn how to earn compounding interest on your Crypto and Fiat assets using Nexo’s Savings Account.” <a href="#sec_nexo_footnote_1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At no point has Nexo or any other entity in the Nexo Group filed a registration statement with the Commission for the offer and sale of the EIP. Nor did the offer and sale of the EIP qualify for an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. The only registrations that Nexo Group entities have with U.S.-based regulators are money transmitter licenses and certain state-level consumer or lender licenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the EIP Terms and Conditions “Risk Disclosure” section, which is available on Nexo’s website, Nexo explained that “Digital Assets are not money or legal tender, are not backed by the government or by a central bank and mostly do not have any underlying assets, revenue stream, or another source of value.” Another provision under the Risk Disclosure section provides:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">You understand and agree that you use the Nexo Account and the Nexo Earn Interest Product at your own risk. This section is not exhaustive and does not disclose all the risks associated with the Digital Assets and the use of the Nexo Earn Interest Product and any of the related Nexo Wallet Services. You shall, therefore, carefully
consider whether such use is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On February 18, 2022, after the Commission announced charges with respect to a crypto investment product similar to the EIP, see BlockFi Lending LLC, Exch. Act Rel. No. 11029 (Feb. 14, 2022), Nexo voluntarily ceased offering and selling the EIP to new U.S. investors. After February 18, 2022, existing U.S. investors continued to earn interest (at varying rates) on assets held in EIP accounts as of that date, but assets added after that date would not earn interest. In early March 2022, just as Nexo put in place these restrictions for U.S. investors, there were approximately 440,000 global investors in the EIP and 112,000 investors in the U.S. As of March 2022, the value of EIP assets was approximately $9 billion globally and $2.7 billion in the U.S.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On December 5, 2022, Nexo proactively announced that it was terminating the EIP in certain states and “phasing out” all of its products and services in the United States, including permanently ceasing to offer and sell the EIP to U.S. investors, and winding down the EIP for existing U.S. investors who continued to earn interest on funds held in the EIP prior to February 18, 2022.</p>

<p>The Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) were designed to “eliminate serious abuses in a largely unregulated securities market.” United Housing Found., Inc. v. Forman, 421 U.S. 837, 849 (1975). They are focused, among other things, “on the capital market of the enterprise system: the sale of securities to raise capital for profit-making purposes . . . and the need for regulation to prevent fraud and to protect the interest of investors.” Id. Under Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act, a security includes any “note.” See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77b. A note is presumed to be a security unless it bears a strong resemblance, to instruments that are not securities, which courts determine by examining four factors: (1) the motivation of the parties; (2) the plan of distribution; (3) the expectations of the investing public; and (4) a risk-reducing factor such as the availability of an alternative regulatory regime that “significantly reduces the risk of the instrument, thereby rendering application of the Securities Acts unnecessary.” See Reves, 494 U.S. at 64–66.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applying the Reves four-part analysis, the EIPs were securities. First, Nexo offered and sold the EIP to obtain crypto assets for the general use of its business, namely to run its lending and investment activities to pay interest to EIP investors, and purchasers invested in the EIP to receive interest on the loaned crypto assets. Second, the EIP was offered and sold to a broad segment of the general public. Third, Nexo promoted the EIP as an investment, specifically as a way to earn a consistent return on crypto assets. Fourth, no alternative regulatory scheme or other risk-reducing factors exist with respect to the EIP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act, a security includes “an investment contract.” See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77b. Based on the facts set forth above, the EIP also constitutes the offer and sale of investment contracts. See Howey, 328 U.S. at 301. Investors in the EIP tendered money to Nexo, in the form of crypto assets, to participate in the EIP. Nexo then pooled the EIP investors’ crypto assets and used those assets for lending and investment activities that would generate returns for both Nexo and EIP investors. The returns earned by each EIP investor were a function of the pooling of the loaned crypto assets, and the ways in which Nexo deployed those loaned assets. In this way, each investor’s fortune was tied to the fortunes of the other investors. In addition, because Nexo earned revenue for itself through its deployment of the loaned assets, the EIP investors’ fortunes were also linked to those of Nexo. Moreover, EIP investors’ return were based on interest rates and proportional to their investments in EIP. Through its public statements, Nexo created a reasonable expectation that EIP investors would earn profits derived from Nexo’s efforts to manage the loaned crypto assets profitably enough to pay the stated interest rates to the investors. Nexo retained ownership and control over the borrowed crypto assets, and determined how much to hold, lend, and invest. Nexo’s lending and investment activities were at its own discretion, and Nexo managed the risks involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nexo did not file a registration statement with the Commission for the offers and sales of EIP, nor did its offers and sales of the EIP qualify for an exemption from registration under the Securities Act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result of the conduct described above, Nexo violated Section 5(a) of the Securities Act, which prohibits, unless a registration statement is in effect as to a security, any person, directly or indirectly, from making use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to sell such security through the use or medium of any prospectus or otherwise; or to carry or cause to be carried through the mails or in interstate commerce, by any means or instruments of transportation, any such security for the purpose of sale or for delivery after sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result of the conduct described above, Nexo also violated Section 5(c) of the Securities Act, which prohibits any person, directly or indirectly, from making use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to offer to sell or offer to buy through the use or medium of any prospectus or otherwise any security, unless a registration statement has been filed as to such security.</p>

</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="22">
<li>
<p>As explained above, on February 18, 2022, after the Commission announced charges involving a similar crypto investment product, Nexo voluntarily ceased offering the EIP to new U.S. investors and ceased paying interest on new funds added to existing EIP accounts of U.S. investors. On December 5, 2022, Nexo proactively announced that it was ceasing the EIP in certain states and phasing out all of its products and services in the United States, including permanently ceasing to offer the EIP to all U.S. investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nexo will cease the EIP as to all U.S. investors by April 1, 2023 and will exit the U.S. entirely shortly thereafter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nexo will maintain the interest rate that is in place as of the date of the entry of this Order on existing U.S. EIP accounts for the duration of the period of time that Nexo takes to phase out all of its products and services in the United States.</p>

If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that it shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission&#8217;s counsel in this action and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action” means a private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this proceeding.</p>

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC” or “Commission”), for its Complaint against Defendants Payward Ventures, Inc. d/b/a Kraken and Payward Trading, Ltd. d/b/a Kraken (collectively “Defendants” or “Kraken”), alleges as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>This case concerns the illegal unregistered offer and sale of securities involving the staking of crypto assets.<a href="#sec_payward_footnote_1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a> In particular, Defendants have offered and sold an investment contract to the general public, including United States investors, whereby investors transfer certain crypto assets to Kraken for “staking” in exchange for advertised annual investment returns of as much as 21% (the “Kraken Staking Program” or “Program”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Staking” concerns the “proof of stake” validation protocols that certain blockchains utilize. These protocols offer rewards to those who “validate”—or confirm—transactions on the blockchain. To become a validator and obtain such rewards, holders of crypto assets must first “stake”—or commit—crypto assets (typically, the “native” crypto asset on a particular blockchain such as Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), and Cosmos (ATOM)). Validators are selected based on the size of their stake, among other factors, creating an incentive to stake, or commit, greater quantities of crypto assets. The protocols incentivize validators to add legitimate transactions to the blockchain because validators are rewarded if they do and could be penalized if they do not, including by having the staked crypto assets “slashed” (or destroyed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Kraken Staking Program is an investment program created by Defendants that aggregates investors’ crypto assets to enable Kraken to stake these pooled investor assets and achieve a competitive advantage in the staking marketplace. Through this pooling of crypto assets and Defendants’ efforts, the Kraken Staking Program purports to offer investors benefits that are not available to investors who stake on their own. Among other things, Defendants advertise regular investment returns and payouts, no staking minimums, their technical expertise in staking, and an easy-to-use platform created by Defendants. In addition, Defendants offer investors instant rewards accrual and the ability instantly to
unstake (essentially, to take back the assets immediately).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants market the Kraken Staking Program by touting specified investment returns for certain staking-eligible crypto assets on the kraken.com website, on social media channels, and through advertisement emails. Defendants determine these returns, not the underlying blockchain protocols, and the returns are not necessarily dependent on the actual returns that Kraken receives from staking. If interested in obtaining these returns, investors can transfer eligible crypto assets to the Program, including by first purchasing the tokens from Kraken’s trading platform for the market price of the token plus a fee or transferring the eligible crypto assets obtained elsewhere to Kraken. Defendants pool these tokens, designating some for staking and some purportedly as a liquidity reserve. Investors lose possession and control over their crypto assets when they transfer those assets to Defendants and accordingly take on risks associated with the Kraken platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pooling and retaining control over the tokens potentially reduces Defendants’ transaction costs and risks and, in the case of tokens actually staked by Defendants to proof of stake protocols, increases the likelihood that Defendants will be selected to validate blockchain transactions and therefore earn rewards, and provides smoother, more reliable rewards. Defendants advertise that their significant efforts, discussed in more detail below, provide investors with constant and regular returns (called “rewards”), more so than investors could achieve if they tried to implement a staking strategy on their own without the benefit of Defendants’ scale and expertise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By April 2022, U.S. investors had over $2.7 billion worth of crypto assets invested in the Kraken Staking Program. Kraken has earned approximately $147 million in net revenue from the Program since its commencement, and a substantial portion of this net revenue—more than $45 million—is attributable to crypto assets obtained from U.S. investors. By June 2022, more than 135,000 unique U.S.-based usernames had transferred crypto assets to participate in the Kraken Staking Program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through the Kraken Staking Program, Defendants have offered and sold investment contracts without registering the offer or sales with the SEC as required by the federal securities laws, and no exemption from the registration requirement applied. The absence of any registration statement means that investors have lacked material information about the Kraken Staking Program. Missing material information includes, but is not limited to, the business and financial condition of Defendants, the fees charged by Defendants, the extent of Defendants’ profits, and specific and detailed risks of the investment, including how Defendants determine to stake investor tokens or purportedly hold them in reserve and the extent of these purported liquidity reserves, or whether tokens are put to some other use. Investors have had no insight into Defendants’ financial condition and whether Defendants have the means of paying the marketed returns—and indeed, per the Kraken Terms of Service, Defendants retain the right not to pay any investor return. Defendants have disclosed only the information that they wish, not the information required by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants continue to offer and sell the Kraken Staking Program without any registration statement, meaning that, until the illegal offering is enjoined, investors will continue to bear the substantial risk resulting from Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws.</p>

</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="19">
<li>
<p>The Securities Act sets forth a regime of full and fair disclosure, in contrast to traditional commercial principles of caveat emptor. Congress mandated that persons who offer and sell securities to the investing public provide sufficient, accurate information to allow investors to make informed decisions before they invest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The definition of a “security” under the Securities Act includes a wide range of investment vehicles, including “investment contracts.” Investment contracts are instruments through which a person invests money in a common enterprise and reasonably expects profits or returns derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 299 (1946). Courts have found that novel or unique investment vehicles constitute investment contracts, including interests in orange groves, animal breeding programs, railroads, mobile phones, and enterprises that exist only on the Internet, including crypto assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act require that issuers of securities register the offer or sale of securities with the SEC, unless an exemption applies. Similarly, those provisions prohibit engaging in the unregistered offer and sale of such securities. Registration statements relating to the offer and sale of securities provide public investors with material information about the issuer and the offering, including financial and managerial information, how the issuer will use offering proceeds, and the risks and trends that affect the enterprise and an investment in its securities.</p>

<p><span class="underline"><strong>BACKGROUND ON CRYPTO ASSETS AND STAKING</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="22">
<li>
<p>The term “crypto asset” generally refers to an asset issued and/or transferred using distributed ledger or blockchain technology, including assets sometimes referred to as “cryptocurrencies,” digital “coins,” and digital “tokens.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A blockchain or distributed ledger is a peer-to-peer database spread across a network of computers that records all transactions in theoretically unchangeable, digitallyrecorded data packages. The system relies on cryptographic techniques for secure recording of transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People can own crypto assets and hold them at a blockchain address under their control. Typically, someone controls an address—and the crypto assets held at that address—with a private cryptographic key for that address. Anyone with that private key can sign and submit a transaction to the blockchain that will transfer the crypto assets at that address to another address. Typically, in a single blockchain address, people can hold multiple types of crypto assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individuals often control multiple blockchain addresses and store their private keys for those addresses in software called a “wallet.” A “wallet” allows them to manage their crypto assets and key information and to communicate with a blockchain. People also can own crypto assets by opening an account on a trading platform (like the Kraken trading platform) and then transferring their crypto assets from their own blockchain address to an address controlled by the trading platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crypto assets may be traded on crypto asset trading platforms in exchange for other crypto assets or fiat currency (legal tender issued by a country), at times by being allocated to investors’ accounts in the records of the platform (i.e., “off-chain”), without necessarily being transferred from one blockchain address to another (i.e., “on-chain”).
Crypto asset trading platforms typically receive a fee for facilitating such trades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blockchains typically employ a consensus mechanism to “validate” crypto asset transactions. A consensus mechanism describes the particular protocol used by a blockchain to agree on which transactions are valid, to update the blockchain, and to compensate certain participants with additional crypto assets. There can be multiple sources
for the compensation, including from fees charged to those transacting on the blockchain or from new crypto assets created or “mined” by the validation of transactions, under the terms of the blockchain protocol. Compensation in the form of newly issued crypto assets may dilute the value of the existing tokens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Validators who participate in confirming transactions on blockchains may collect fees to participate in the validation of transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consensus mechanism typically is a set of rules followed by the validator nodes, or computers on a blockchain’s network running the blockchain protocol that are able to validate transactions. “Proof of work” and “proof of stake” describe the two major “consensus mechanisms” used by blockchains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of work, such as in the protocol used by the Bitcoin blockchain, involves computers, or validator nodes, attempting to “mine” a “block” of transactions, in part, by guessing a pre-determined number. The first miner to successfully guess this number earns the right to update the blockchain and to be rewarded with crypto assets. This mining process typically requires a large amount of computing power and energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of stake, used by blockchains such as the Cardano (ADA), Ethereum (ETH), Polkadot (DOT), and Cosmos (ATOM) blockchains, involves the protocol selecting from crypto asset holders who have committed or “staked” a minimum number of tokens to validate transactions. Typically, users can stake their own crypto assets, or they can delegate their crypto assets to a particular node for that node to use them in staking. Nodes often act as “staking pools” when others designate their crypto assets to that node for staking of their tokens. A person or entity operating a node is called a “node operator.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In general, the greater portion of crypto assets staked by an individual or group relative to all the staked tokens, the more likely that holder is to be selected as a validator and earn the ability to receive the staking rewards. Thus, the most successful staking operations are those that maximize the chances of being selected by the protocol, and thus being rewarded with more crypto assets—typically by staking a large number of tokens and minimizing server downtime. In addition, for some crypto assets, the probability of being selected as validator increases when a node operator delegates its own tokens for staking alongside its customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typically, crypto assets are unavailable for trading or other purposes when staked, while protocols will automatically distribute a portion of the crypto asset rewards to the successful node operator. To encourage more nodes to participate in validation, protocols typically cap rewards once the nodes reach a certain size. As the cap is approached, node operators can start an additional node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “staking” of crypto assets is meant to incentivize good faith and honest validation of transactions, as staked tokens may be “slashed” (or destroyed), and no rewards will be paid, if transactions are not validated appropriately. Typically, the protocol rewards the selected validator with additional crypto assets only if the validator successfully and correctly validates a new block on the chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another component of certain proof of stake protocols is known as the “bonding”/“unbonding” period. The bonding period is a length of time set by the protocol for a crypto asset to be staked by a validator in order to begin earning rewards. The unbonding period is a length of time set by the protocol to release staked crypto assets back to the validator. In certain cases, a bonding period may mean that it can take weeks before a crypto asset validator can begin earning rewards. The unbonding period can mean it can take weeks for a crypto asset validator to unbond tokens (release them from staking) and potentially do something else with them, such as trade them for other crypto assets or exchange them for fiat. During the time the crypto assets are bonded, the crypto asset owners are unable to transact in them, for example, to react to market price fluctuations of the tokens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certain protocols charge crypto asset validators fees to stake and unstake tokens, require an upfront refundable deposit in addition to the tokens staked, and/or require the delegation of a minimum amount of tokens to participate in staking.</p>

<li>
<p>THE KRAKEN STAKING PROGRAM</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="37">
<li>
<p>In December 2019, Kraken launched its Staking Program as a means to participate in, and profit from, the “proof of stake” consensus mechanism of certain blockchains, by obtaining investors’ crypto assets, pooling those assets, and then staking some portion of those assets in order to obtain rewards, a portion of which Kraken distributes to the investors and a portion of which Kraken retains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kraken advertises that the Program offers investors worldwide, including most U.S. investors, an investment opportunity to participate in proof of stake consensus and receive benefits that may not be available to those investors if they staked on their own. For example, Defendants’ Program offers to investors no staking minimums, no upfront fees or deposits, purported industry-leading cybersecurity protections, a simplified and easy-to-use one-stop-shop trading platform, and the ability, through Kraken’s efforts, to obtain returns based on Kraken’s participation in proof of stake activities for different types of tokens. In addition, for most of the Kraken Staking Program’s staking-eligible crypto assets, the Program also offers investors instant reward accrual, the ability to instantly “unstake” (i.e., to demand the immediate return of crypto assets and not have to comply with unbonding periods that would apply if the investor participated directly), automatic weekly or twice-weekly payout dates, and custom and steady returns with promised minimum returns.</p>
</li>

</div>
<div class="olist upperalpha">
<ol class="upperalpha" type="A">
<li>
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Defendants’ Efforts Result In Unique Benefits To Investors In The Kraken Staking Program</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="39">
<li>
<p>The Kraken Staking Program has several features that differentiate it from staking and earning rewards on your own.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Passive Investment Opportunity</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="40">
<li>
<p>The Kraken Staking Program is a passive investment opportunity. To participate, investors need only establish an account at kraken.com and purchase stakingeligible tokens from the kraken.com trading platform (for a fee), or transfer their existing staking-eligible tokens to a kraken.com account. Investors then sign-up for the Kraken Staking Program and transfer their crypto assets to the possession and control of Defendants.<a href="#sec_payward_footnote_2"><sup><strong>(2)</strong></sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants then perform all of the efforts necessary and expected by the investors to obtain the advertised and promised investment return. These efforts include:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Determining how many tokens to actually stake (see infra, ¶¶ 51-54);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determining how many tokens to reserve in order to provide “instant unstaking” and liquidity for investors (see infra, ¶¶ 49-52);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Staking investor tokens, operating the nodes, and validating blockchain transactions in order to obtain rewards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determining the pro rata investor return (see infra, ¶¶ 44-48);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distributing those investor returns;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing a user-friendly, one-stop-shop investor interface (see infra, ¶ 58); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking further steps as detailed below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Pooling of Crypto Assets</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="42">
<li>
<p>Defendants control and pool crypto assets invested in the Kraken Staking Program together with their own proprietary tokens in wallets controlled by Defendants. They then determine when and how many of these pooled tokens to stake in the underlying protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pooling of tokens, and the correspondingly larger number of tokens to be staked in the proof of stake protocols, increases the probability that the blockchain protocol will select Defendants to validate transactions and earn rewards and provides smoother, more reliable rewards. According to a Kraken Blog Post dated December 8, 2020: “As staking via Kraken pools client tokens together, it improves the chances that they will be selected to verify transactions, thereby increasing potential payouts.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Kraken-Determined Investment Returns</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="44">
<li>
<p>The returns that investors receive from the Kraken Staking Program differ from the returns that an investor could expect if the investor staked directly (assuming the investor even had the technological capability and sufficient tokens to stake and obtain rewards). Investors in the Kraken Staking Program receive a reward determined by Defendants, not the reward determined by the underlying blockchain protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In general, staking services can offer set or discretionary reward amounts. Here, Defendants retain the discretion to determine the reward amounts while marketing specific returns (e.g., 4-7% for Ethereum, 9-12% for Polkadot, and 12-15% for Cosmos). In other words, Defendants reserve the right not to pay this advertised return—or indeed any reward. The Kraken Terms of Service states that the marketed return is “an estimate only and not guaranteed” and “may change at any time in Payward Trading’s sole discretion.”<a href="#sec_payward_footnote_3"><sup><strong>(3)</strong></sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The marketed return does not account for all staking rewards. Defendants retain for themselves those rewards that exceed the marketed range and do not generally disclose to investors the amount of rewards Defendants retain for themselves. In other words, Defendants do not disclose sufficient information for investors to determine if they are receiving their fair share of the staking rewards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While information about fees, margin, and node success rates are generally available via the underlying protocol itself (or from third-parties), Defendants do not disclose their fees or operating costs for the Kraken Staking Program. Defendants tell investors that their “fee can vary based on the rewards that we earn on behalf of our clients each month. The important point to remember is that our fixed rewards are net of any fees that we charge.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Frequent, Regular Payouts</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="48">
<li>
<p>Defendants also promise regular investment payouts for most staked tokens—typically weekly or twice per week—that deviate from the way rewards are distributed by the underlying staking protocol. In this regard, Defendants advertise that they have “taken the initiative to smooth this revenue stream for our clients by enabling predictable pay-outs as part of our staking services.” For example, regarding staking for certain crypto assets, Kraken’s blog states, “Payouts happen twice a week – every Monday and Thursday at 14:00 UTC […] among the fastest in the industry.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Liquidity and Immediate Rewards</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="49">
<li>
<p>Defendants emphasize that investors in the Kraken Staking Program, with limited exceptions, are not subject to bonding and unbonding periods as they would be if they staked these crypto assets directly with most underlying staking protocols. In other words, unlike staking-on-your-own, investors in the Kraken Staking Program are promised enhanced liquidity and immediate rewards. A 2020 Kraken blog post states: “Unlike other staking services, you start earning rewards within minutes of staking your funds,” highlighting an investor’s “flexibility to instantly unstake and trade your funds [on Kraken’s trading platform].” Kraken’s website provides:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">Unlike other staking services, at Kraken there is no minimum On-chain staking time needed to earn rewards. You start earning pro-rated rewards for On-chain staking as soon as your instructions to stake are processed by Kraken (which may be within minutes of you staking your funds).<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
For example, if you utilized On-chain staking for a few hours and then un-staked your funds, you would still be credited prorated rewards on the next payout day. In contrast, on other services you would not receive anything. Unlike other staking services we also have no bonding and unbonding period for Onchain staking (other than ETH2).</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In effect, Defendants are advertising that they will pay rewards to investors during the period between when the investor transfers his or her assets to the Kraken Staking Program and when the investor demands to receive his or her crypto assets back from the Program. Defendants promise that the Staking Program will begin paying rewards (returns) when investors transfer their crypto assets to the Program, regardless of a blockchain protocol’s bonding period, and promise immediately to return investors’ crypto assets even if the tokens used by Defendants and staked with a protocol actually remain locked and unavailable for the unbonding period.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Not All Tokens Staked</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="51">
<li>
<p>Defendants claim that they are able to offer instant liquidity (regardless of the unbonding period) because the pooled tokens are fungible and, according to them, Defendants do not actually stake every investor token transferred to them. For many of these crypto assets, Defendants state that they hold back a subset of tokens as a “liquidity reserve.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, Defendants do not disclose the extent of these “unstaked” tokens and how they are used. Investors accordingly have no way of analyzing whether Kraken actually can meet all requests for instant liquidity through these reserves or otherwise. In other words, given the limited disclosure regarding the Kraken Staking Program, Defendants do not provide sufficient information to demonstrate that they, at all times, maintain a token reserve that is adequate to honor the Program’s “no unbonding period” and “instant unstaking” representations should multiple investors with large staking positions seek to redeem those positions at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants are under no obligation to segregate the crypto assets that investors transfer to them in exchange for the advertised return (marketed as being from proof of stake activities). Defendants can account for these transfers by rebalancing their internal ledger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, Defendants do not disclose the extent to which Defendants commingle “unstaked” tokens with Defendants’ other assets or business endeavors. Nor do Defendants disclose the true source of the returns paid to investors to the extent rewards are paid with respect to “unstaked” tokens.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Not Directly Subject To Transaction And Deposit Fees, Or Minimum Staking Thresholds</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="55">
<li>
<p>Certain underlying staking protocols impose upfront transaction fees for staking and unstaking, as well as require a refundable deposit above the amount of staked tokens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investors in the Kraken Staking Program are not directly subject to these fees as they do not actually participate in the staking protocols directly, and no initial deposits are required. However, the amount of return that investors receive may be reduced by Defendants based on these and other fees and expenses. Defendants are not required to verify the amount of rewards received, nor verify the amount of any fees charged to Defendants when participating in the staking protocols, or otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, staking protocols generally require a certain threshold number of tokens to be able to participate in staking. The Kraken Staking Program does not require that investors commit any minimum threshold of tokens to participate in the Program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Purportedly Safe, Easy-To-Use Platform</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="58">
<li>
<p>Kraken offers a simplified user interface. Kraken’s blog states: “Token holders have previously had little choice other than to stake tokens themselves, something that requires technical understanding.” The FAQs state: “Couldn’t I Stake Myself for Free? While you are certainly able to stake yourself, that process can be complex[.]” Another blog entry states: “Instead of needing to purchase special equipment to compete for newly minted network tokens, users are instead able to stake their funds in Kraken’s stake pool.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kraken also advertises the supposed security of the platform. It touts that its “team of experts have built in a number of sophisticated measures to prevent theft of funds, NFTs or information. Theft isn’t the only threat of course. As a professional exchange we offer financial stability, with full reserves, healthy banking relationships and the highest standards of legal compliance.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kraken further states that it has “assembled a global team of top security professionals who take a risk-based approach to ensuring our clients’ assets are protected at the highest levels while maintaining exceptional performance and an unparalleled client experience. Our team has decades of experience building security programs for the world’s top brands, investigating the largest consumer data breaches, developing security technology trusted by millions of businesses and discovering vulnerabilities in the technology used by billions of people every day.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants also tout that they are trustworthy. A November 10, 2022 blog post on Kraken.com titled, “How Kraken Continues to Lead the way in Transparency and Trust” states, in part:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">[W]e are proud to say that Kraken has long taken the lead when it comes to transparency. In fact, we pioneered the use of regular asset audits in 2014 and hired [an accounting firm] to produce two Proof of Reserve audits over the past year alone. These cryptographic audits are more precise and immutable than any other form of financial statement
and we are one of the first exchanges to perform them regularly.<br/>
Proof of Reserve audits cryptographically prove that we hold the assets we say we hold on your behalf. While this process is almost impossible for traditional financial institutions to conduct, the open and transparent properties of cryptocurrencies enable us to produce these precise audits regularly.<a href="#sec_payward_footnote_4"><sup><strong>(4)</strong></sup></a></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A November 18, 2022 blog post on Kraken.com similarly states: “Kraken offers a comprehensive approach to Proof of Reserves that verifies not just reserves, but also liabilities. Cryptographically proving that we hold our clients’ covered assets in reserve at the time of an audit is only half the battle. Kraken’s Proof of Reserves also includes covered liabilities (i.e., tokens in client accounts).” However, Defendants also describe the limitations of the purported audit, including that it “cannot identify any hidden encumbrances or prove that funds had not been borrowed for purposes of passing the audit.” In other words, the “proof of reserves” audit is akin to a balance sheet that lists assets but not every liability; proof of reserves may not offer investor protection in this scenario.</p>

<li>
<p>“Last year, we paid out over $27 million in token staking rewards … Want to earn up to 20% a year staking crypto assets?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Staking is a great way to maximize your holdings in staking coins and fiat that would otherwise be sitting in your Kraken account. Once you have staked your assets you can earn staking rewards on top of your holdings and grow them further by compounding those future rewards.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Your rewards will be compounded with the Grow Rewards feature, which adds your earned rewards every week back into On-chain staking. This means if you continue to leave your funds staked you may earn more than the RPY percent.”</p>

<p>As of June 2022, there were more than 135,000 unique U.S.-based usernames investing in the Kraken Staking Program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since launching the Kraken Staking Program in December 2019 and through mid-2022, U.S. investors had staked over $2.7 billion worth of crypto assets in the Kraken Staking Program. Kraken has earned at least $147 million as net revenue throughout the life of the Program, of which at least $45.2 million is attributable to U.S. investors. Defendants’ net income attributable to U.S. investors in the Staking Program is $14.95 million. According to Kraken’s 2021 Annual Shareholder Update, “Staking was Kraken’s fastest growing product in 2021 and accounted for more than one-third of Kraken’s gross revenue growth.” As also stated in the same Update: “As we continue to support new staking assets and offer highly attractive rewards, clients are incentivized to keep more assets on platform, increasing the amount of capital available for clients to exchange between assets, driving volume growth and promoting client stickiness.”</p>

</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="70">
<li>
<p>Defendants’ offer and sale of the Kraken Staking Program involves an investment of money. Under the Howey framework, an investment of “money” may but need not take the form of fiat currency. Here, investors purchase crypto assets from Defendants (with fiat or crypto assets) and then transfer them to the Defendants’ Kraken Staking Program; alternatively, investors transfer their own crypto assets to Defendants for staking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investors put their crypto assets at risk as part of the Kraken Staking Program. Defendants have control over all the crypto assets invested in the Kraken Staking Program and choose when and how to use them. (As explained above, Defendants do not actually stake all crypto assets received from investors.) Moreover, according to the Kraken Terms of Service, these crypto assets may be encumbered by Kraken’s creditors. In addition, to the extent that an investor’s crypto assets actually are staked to the underlying blockchain protocol, those assets are at risk of being slashed.<a href="#sec_payward_footnote_5"><sup><strong>(5)</strong></sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investors also have liquidity and market risk. Defendants market the Kraken Staking Program’s advantage of “instant unbonding” and instant return of “staked” crypto assets. But, as noted above, Defendants do not disclose the extent of their crypto-asset reserves and whether these reserves are sufficient to meet all redemption demands. If these reserves are insufficient, Kraken may be unable to honor a redemption request in a timely fashion, if at all. Investors could suffer market losses if the value of their crypto assets declines while waiting for redemption.</p>

<ol class="arabic" start="">
<li>
<p>Investors in the Kraken Staking Program participate in a common enterprise with other investors and with Defendants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investor tokens are transferred and pooled in wallets for the purposes of the Kraken Staking Program, and Defendants determine when and how many of these pooled tokens to stake. During this time, and for as long as the investor chooses to stake his or her tokens, investors receive a pre-calculated payout from Defendants. Defendants market that these payouts are distributed pro rata to investors depending on the amount of tokens they have staked (i.e., Defendants advertise a fixed return for all investors). Defendants do not segregate or separately manage an individual investor’s crypto assets as part of the Kraken Staking Program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fortunes of investors and Defendants also are tied together in this common enterprise. For example, as explained above, the larger the pool of assets for staking, the higher the likelihood of obtaining rewards, which inures to the benefit of all investors and Defendants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, the revenues and profits that Defendants stand to receive (i.e., the portion of the staking rewards that Defendants keep for themselves and use to fund their operations) grow as more investors participate in the Kraken Staking Program and purchase tokens on Kraken’s trading platform to stake. All rewards generated from the Kraken Staking Program also flow directly to Defendants, who determine whether and how many tokens in the pool to stake, and how often (and how much in rewards) to pay investors. If the pools are more successful in generating returns than Kraken’s advertised reward rates, Defendants retain the difference. Further, Defendants contribute their own tokens to the pool of tokens contributed by investors to the Kraken Staking Program when they engage in proof of stake activities.</p>

<li>
<p>Investors in the Kraken Staking Program reasonably expect to profit from Defendants’ efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From its inception, Defendants have marketed the Kraken Staking Program as an investment opportunity. As detailed above, through the kraken.com website, a Kraken blog, and social media channels, Defendants have promoted the Kraken Staking Program as a way for investors to earn a high investment return—“the highest fixed-rate returns in the industry.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants also market the advantages of the Kraken Staking Program over staking independently. According to Defendants, these advantages include simplifying a complex staking process with an easy-to-use interface in a secure and trustworthy environment operated by technical experts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investors are led to expect that Defendants will expend efforts to generate the investment returns. For example, Defendants advertise that they have the technical ability and expertise to stake crypto assets, to undertake strategies about when and how to stake crypto assets, and to obtain and manage the regular and frequent reward payouts. Defendants’ efforts are essential to the success or failure of the enterprise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, because Defendants advertise that Defendants will retain a portion of the staking rewards, investors are reasonably led to expect that Defendants have strong financial incentives to engage in the efforts required to make the enterprise successful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants’ statements and actions, and the economic reality of the arrangements with respect to the Kraken Staking Program, have led and will continue to lead reasonable investors to expect Defendants to undertake significant and essential technical, managerial, and entrepreneurial efforts.</p>

<p>Defendants have used interstate commerce to offer and sell the Kraken Staking Program by, among other things, engaging in general solicitation through the kraken.com website and other promotional materials, including emails and social media.</p>

<p>Defendants have never had a registration statement filed or in effect with the SEC for their offers and sales of the Kraken Staking Program. No exemption from registration applied or applies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants’ public disclosures have contained selective or no information about Defendants’ financial history, audited financial statements, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, and ability to generate profits. Investors in the Kraken Staking Program also have not received information about Defendants’ operations, financial condition, liabilities, or other factors relevant in considering whether to invest in the Kraken Staking Program. Investors further have lacked full and detailed information regarding how Defendants use reserves to meet redemptive requests (including whether there are segregated reserves and the extent of those reserves) and have been deprived of information about the staking rewards that Defendants keep for themselves. For example, Defendants do not disclose fees and expenses related to the Kraken Staking Program. Nor do Defendants disclose what they do with “unstaked” tokens, the extent to which Defendants are staking investor tokens, whether Defendants are lending, borrowing, trading, or otherwise alienating investor tokens into some enterprise other than staking protocols, whether and to what extent Defendants are commingling “unstaked” tokens with other assets, the source of rewards paid to investors particularly with respect to “unstaked” tokens, and sufficient information for investors to otherwise determine whether they are receiving a fair share of staking rewards from Defendants.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>From March 4, 2019 to the present, BlockFi, a New Jersey-based financial services company and wholly owned subsidiary of BlockFi, Inc., has offered and sold BlockFi Interest Accounts (“BIAs”) to investors, through which investors lend crypto assets to BlockFi in exchange for BlockFi’s promise to provide a variable monthly interest payment. BlockFi generated the interest paid out to BIA investors by deploying its assets in various ways, including loans of crypto assets made to institutional and corporate borrowers, lending U.S. dollars to retail investors, and by investing in equities and futures. As of March 31, 2021, BlockFi and its affiliates held approximately $14.7 billion in BIA investor assets. As of December 8, 2021, BlockFi and its affiliates held approximately $10.4 billion in BIA investor assets, and had approximately 572,160 BIA investors, including 391,105 investors in the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the facts and circumstances set forth below, the BIAs were securities because they were notes under Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, 494 U.S. 56, 64–66 (1990), and its progeny, and also because BlockFi offered and sold the BIAs as investment contracts, under SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 301 (1946), and its progeny, including the cases discussed by the Commission in its Report of Investigation Pursuant To Section 21(a) Of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO (Exchange Act Rel. No. 81207) (July 25, 2017). BlockFi promised BIA investors a variable interest rate, determined by BlockFi on a periodic basis, in exchange for crypto assets loaned by the investors, who could demand that BlockFi return their loaned assets at any time. BlockFi thus borrowed the crypto assets in exchange for a promise to repay with interest. Investors in the BIAs had a reasonable expectation of obtaining a future profit from BlockFi’s efforts in managing the BIAs based on BlockFi’s statements about how it would generate the yield to pay BIA investors interest. Investors also had a reasonable expectation that BlockFi would use the invested crypto assets in BlockFi’s lending and principal investing activity, and that investors would share profits in the form of interest payments resulting from BlockFi’s efforts. BlockFi offered and sold the BIAs to the general public to obtain crypto assets for the general use of its business, namely to run its lending and investment activities to pay interest to BIA investors, and promoted the BIAs as an investment. BlockFi offered and sold securities without a registration statement filed or in effect with the Commission and without qualifying for an exemption from registration; as a result, BlockFi violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BlockFi also made a materially false and misleading statement on its website from March 4, 2019 to August 31, 2021, concerning its collateral practices and, therefore, the risks associated with its lending activity. As a result, and as discussed in more detail below, BlockFi violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, from at least December 31, 2019 to at least September 30, 2021, BlockFi operated as an unregistered investment company because it is an issuer of securities engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities and owning investment securities, as defined by Section 3(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act, having a value exceeding 40% of its total assets (exclusive of Government securities and cash items). BlockFi violated Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act by engaging in interstate commerce while failing to register as an investment company with the Commission.</p>

<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="8">
<li>
<p>On March 4, 2019, BlockFi publicly announced the launch of the BIA, through which investors could lend crypto assets to BlockFi and in exchange, receive interest, “paid monthly in cryptocurrency.” Interest began accruing the day after assets were transmitted to BlockFi and compounded monthly, with interest payments made to accounts associated with each BIA investor, in crypto assets, on or about the first business day of each month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BlockFi offered and sold BIAs to obtain crypto assets for the general use of its business, namely to use the assets in its lending and investment activities, which generated income both for BlockFi and to pay interest to BIA investors. BlockFi pooled the loaned assets, and exercised full discretion over how much to hold, lend, and invest. BlockFi had complete legal ownership and control over the loaned crypto assets, and advertised that it managed the risks involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under BlockFi’s terms for the BIA, investors:
<span class="quoteblock">grant BlockFi the right, without further notice to [the investor], to hold the cryptocurrency held in [the] account in BlockFi’s name or in another name, and to pledge, repledge, hypothecate, rehypothecate, sell, lend, or otherwise transfer, invest or use any amount of such cryptocurrency, separately or together with other property, with all attendant rights of ownership, and for any period of time and without retaining in BlockFi’s possession and/or control a like amount of cryptocurrency, and to use or invest such cryptocurrency at its own risk.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist text-justify">
<ol class="text-justify" start="11">
<li>
<p>At all relevant times, BlockFi represented that it earned interest on the assets that it borrowed from BIA investors by lending those crypto assets to institutional borrowers. Beginning in September 2020, BlockFi disclosed on its website that it also purchased “SEC-regulated equities and predominantly CFTC-regulated futures” using BIA assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To begin investing in a BIA, an investor could transfer crypto assets to the digital wallet address assigned by BlockFi to the investor, or purchase crypto assets with fiat currency from BlockFi Trading for the purpose of investing in a BIA. BlockFi Trading accepted the crypto asset or fiat from the investor, and then transferred the asset or fiat to BlockFi. BlockFi did not hold private keys for the investors’ wallet addresses; rather, investors’ crypto assets were sent to BlockFi’s wallet addresses at third-party custodians.</p>

<li>
<p>BIA investors were permitted to withdraw the equivalent to the crypto assets they loaned to BlockFi at any time, with some limitations, and could borrow money in U.S. dollars against the amount of crypto assets deposited in BIAs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BlockFi adjusted the interest rates payable on BIAs for particular crypto assets periodically, and typically at the start of each month. BlockFi set the rates based, in part, on “the yield that [BlockFi] can generate from lending,” to institutional borrowers, and thus it was correlated with the efforts that BlockFi put in to generate that yield. BlockFi periodically adjusted its interest rates payable on the BIAs in part after analysis of current yield on its investment and lending activity. BIA investors could demand that BlockFi repay the loaned crypto assets at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BlockFi regularly touted the profits investors may earn by investing in a BIA. When announcing the BIA, BlockFi promoted the interest earned, promising “an industry-leading 6.2% [annual percentage yield],” compounded monthly. BlockFi described it as “an easy way for crypto investors to earn bitcoin as they HODL.”<a href="#blockfi_lending_ftnote_2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the first few weeks of launching the BIA, BlockFi again touted investors’ potential for profit. On March 20, 2019, BlockFi announced that BIAs experienced significant growth, including from large firms who participated in BIAs “as a way to bolster their returns.” BlockFi asserted that it “provide[d] the average crypto investor with the tools to build their wealth,” and that it “look[ed] forward to giving even more investors a chance to earn a yield on their crypto.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On April 1, 2019, BlockFi began to “tier” the interest rates that investors received, initially announcing that “BIA balances of up to and including 25 [Bitcoin] or 500 [Ether] (equivalent to roughly $100,000 and $70,000 respectively) will earn the 6.2% APY interest rate. All balances over that limit will earn a tiered rate of 2% interest.” Even when changing the interest rates customers receive, BlockFi touted the yields to investors. On August 27, 2021, BlockFi stated that the adjustments to interest rates are done “with the goal of maintaining great rates for the maximum number of clients.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On January 1, 2021, BlockFi advertised that it had “distributed more than $50 million in monthly interest payments to [its] clients.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As of November 1, 2021, the interest rates BlockFi paid investors ranged from 0.1% to 9.5%, depending on the type of crypto asset and the size of the investment. For example, investors could receive 9.5% in interest for up to 40,000 Tether (“USDT”) and 8.5% for anything over 40,000 USDT, as well as 4.5% interest for up to 0.1 Bitcoin (“BTC”), 1% for 0.1 to 0.35 BTC, and 0.1% for anything over 0.35 BTC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BlockFi offered and sold the BIA securities to investors, including retail investors, through advertising and general solicitations on its website, www.blockfi.com. BlockFi also promoted distribution of the BIA offering through its social media accounts, including YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook. In addition, through its “Partner” program, an affiliate marketing program in which participants could “earn passive income by introducing your audience to financial tools for crypto investors,” BlockFi extended its distribution of the BIA securities to retail investors through certain offers and promotions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BlockFi did not have a Securities Act registration statement filed or in effect with the Commission for the offer and sale of the BIAs, nor did the offer and sale of BIAs qualify for an exemption from registration under the Securities Act.</p>

<p>BlockFi made a material misrepresentation to BIA investors concerning the level of risk in its loan portfolio. Beginning at the time of the BIA launch on March 4, 2019 and continuing to August 31, 2021, BlockFi made a statement in multiple website posts that its institutional loans were “typically” over-collateralized, when in fact, most institutional loans were not. When BlockFi began offering the BIA investment, it intended to require over-collateralization on a majority of its loans to institutional investors, but it quickly became apparent that large institutional investors were frequently not willing to post large amounts of collateral to secure their loans. Approximately 24% of institutional crypto asset loans made in 2019 were overcollateralized; in 2020 approximately 16% were over-collateralized; and in 2021 (through June 30, 2021) approximately 17% were over-collateralized. As a result, BlockFi’s statement materially overstated the degree to which it secured protection from defaults by institutional borrowers through collateral. Through operational oversight, BlockFi’s personnel failed to take steps to update the website statement to accurately reflect the fact that most institutional loans were not over-collateralized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although BlockFi made other disclosures on its website regarding its risk management practices, because of BlockFi’s misrepresentation and omission about the level of risk in its loan portfolio, BIA investors did not have complete and accurate information with which to evaluate the risk that, in the event of defaults by its institutional borrowers, BlockFi would be unable to comply with its obligation to pay BIA investors the stated interest rates or return the loaned crypto assets to investors upon demand.</p>

<p><strong>BlockFi Operated as an Unregistered Investment Company</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist text-justify">
<ol class="text-justify" start="24">
<li>
<p>As the issuer of the BIA, BlockFi is an “issuer” for purposes of the Investment Company Act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the launch of the BIA, BlockFi pooled the crypto assets it borrowed, and commingled and rehypothecated these crypto assets received from investors in the BIAs with
BlockFi’s other assets, including collateral received from institutional borrowers. As BlockFi took
ownership of the loaned crypto assets from investors in the BIAs, BlockFi used the commingled assets to, among other things, make loans to institutional and retail borrowers, stake crypto assets, and purchase crypto asset trust shares and interests in private funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From at least December 31, 2019 to at least September 30, 2021, BlockFi owned certain investment securities, as defined by Section 3(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act—such as loans of crypto assets and U.S. dollars to counter parties, investments in crypto asset trusts and funds, and intercompany receivables—exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. For example, as of December 31, 2020, BlockFi held loans to counter parties valued at over $1.9 billion, investments in crypto asset trusts and funds valued at approximately $1.5 billion, and intercompany receivables valued at approximately $847 million, which together constituted well over 40% of its approximately $4.8 billion in total assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section 3(a)(1)&#169; of the Investment Company Act defines “investment company” to mean any issuer that “is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40 per centum of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.” Section 3(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act defines “investment securities” to include all securities except government securities, securities issued by employees’ securities companies, and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries of the owner which are not investment companies and not relying on exceptions set forth in Sections 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. Loans that BlockFi made to counter parties are considered investment securities under the Investment Company Act. As an issuer holding over 40% of the value of its total assets in investment securities from at least December 31, 2019 to at least September 30, 2021, BlockFi met the definition of an investment company during this time period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since at least December 31, 2019, BlockFi has engaged in interstate commerce by, among other things, making loans to institutional and retail investors, purchasing and selling other investment securities for its own account, and engaging in other business transactions in interstate commerce while an investment company within the meaning of Section 3(a)(1)&#169; of the Investment Company Act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although BlockFi met the definition of “investment company” from at least December 31, 2019 to at least September 30, 2021, it did not register with the Commission as an investment company, meet any statutory exemptions or exclusions from the definition of an investment company, or seek an order from the Commission declaring that it was primarily engaged in a business other than that of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, or exempting it from complying with any provisions of the Investment Company Act or the rules thereunder. Although BlockFi has suggested that it was relying on the exclusion from the definition of “investment company” provided for “market intermediaries” by Section 3(c)(2) of the Investment Company Act during this period, it did not satisfy the terms of that exclusion. Thus, 8 during the relevant period, BlockFi was required to have registered with the Commission as an investment company.</p>

<p><strong>Legal Analysis</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>A. Violation of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="30">
<li>
<p>The Securities Act and the Exchange Act were designed to “eliminate serious abuses in a largely unregulated securities market.” United Housing Found., Inc. v. Forman, 421 U.S. 837, 849 (1975). They are focused, among other things, “on the capital market of the enterprise system: the sale of securities to raise capital for profit-making purposes . . . and the need for regulation to prevent fraud and to protect the interest of investors. Id. Under Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act, a security includes any “note.” See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77b &amp; 78c. A note is presumed to be a security unless it falls into certain judiciallycreated categories of financial instruments that are not securities, or if the note in question bears a “family resemblance” to notes in those categories based on a four-part test. See Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, 494 U.S. 56, 64–66 (1990), and its progeny. Applying the Reves four-part analysis, the BIAs were notes and thus securities. First, BlockFi offered and sold BIAs to obtain crypto assets for the general use of its business, namely to run its lending and investment activities to pay interest to BIA investors, and purchasers bought BIAs to receive interest ranging from 0.1% to 9.5% on the loaned crypto assets. Second, BIAs were offered and sold to a broad segment of the general public. Third, BlockFi promoted BIAs as an investment, specifically as a way to earn a consistent return on crypto assets and for investors to “build their wealth.” Fourth, no alternative regulatory scheme or other risk reducing factors exist with respect to BIAs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act, a security includes “an investment contract.” See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77b, 78c. Based on the facts and circumstances set forth above, the BIAs were also offered and sold as “investment contracts,” as they meet the elements for an investment contract under SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 301 (1946), and its progeny, including the cases discussed by the Commission in its Report of Investigation Pursuant To Section 21(a) Of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO (Exchange Act Rel. No. 81207) (July 25, 2017), citing Forman, 421 U.S. at 852-53 (The “touchstone” of an investment contract “is the presence of an investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.”); see also SEC v. R.G. Reynolds Enterprises, Inc., 952 F.2d 1125 1130-31 (9th Cir. 1991) (finding managed account product was an investment contract where investors provided funds in exchange for interest rate earned through the issuer’s investment of the funds). BlockFi sold BIAs in exchange for the investment of money in the form of crypto assets. BlockFi pooled the BIA investors’ crypto assets, and used those assets for lending and investment activity that would generate returns for both BlockFi and BIA investors. The returns earned by each BIA investor were a function of the pooling of the loaned crypto assets, and the ways in which BlockFi deployed those loaned assets. In this way, each investor’s fortune was tied to the fortunes of the other investors. In addition, because BlockFi earned revenue for itself through its deployment of the loaned assets, the BIA investors’ fortunes were also linked to those of the promoter, i.e., BlockFi. Through its public statements, BlockFi created a reasonable expectation that BIA investors would earn profits derived from BlockFi’s efforts to manage the loaned crypto
assets profitably enough to pay the stated interest rates to the investors. BlockFi had complete ownership and control over the borrowed crypto assets, and determined how much to hold, lend, and invest. BlockFi’s lending activities were at its own discretion, and BlockFi advertised that it managed the risks involved. Similarly, its investment activities were at its own discretion, and BlockFi could decide whether and how to invest the BIA assets in equities or futures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BlockFi did not have a registration statement filed or in effect with the Commission for the offers and sales of BIAs, nor did it qualify for an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for those offers and sales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result of the conduct described above, BlockFi violated Section 5(a) of the Securities Act, which prohibits, unless a registration statement is in effect as to a security, any person, directly or indirectly, from making use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to sell such security through the use or medium of any prospectus or otherwise; or to carry or cause to be carried through the mails or in interstate commerce, by any means or instruments of transportation, any such security for the purpose of sale or for delivery after sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result of the conduct described above, BlockFi also violated Section 5(c) of the Securities Act, which prohibits any person, directly or indirectly, from making use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to offer to sell or offer to buy through the use or medium of any prospectus or otherwise any security, unless a registration statement has been filed as to such security.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>B. Violation of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="35">
<li>
<p>As a result of the conduct described above, BlockFi violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, which prohibit any person in the offer or sale of securities from obtaining money or property by means of any untrue statement of material fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make statements made not misleading, and from engaging in any practice or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser, respectively. From March 2019 through August 2021, BlockFi misrepresented on its website that its institutional loans were “typically” over-collateralized, when in fact, most institutional loans were not. Accordingly, although BlockFi made other disclosures on its website concerning its risk management practices, BIA investors did not have complete and accurate information with which to evaluate the risk that, in the event of defaults by BlockFi’s institutional borrowers, BlockFi would be unable to comply with its obligation to pay BIA investors the stated interest rates or return the loaned crypto assets to investors upon demand. This false and misleading statement was in the offer and sale of BIAs, and as such was in the offer and sale of securities. A violation of these provisions does not require scienter and may rest on a finding of negligence. See Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 685, 701-02 (1980).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>C. Violation of Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="36">
<li>
<p>As a result of the conduct described above, BlockFi violated Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act, which makes it unlawful for an unregistered investment company to, among other things, directly or indirectly “[o]ffer for sale, sell, or deliver after sale, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, any security or any interest in a security” or “engage in any business in interstate commerce.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From at least December 31, 2019 to at least September 30, 2021, BlockFi held assets meeting the definition of investment securities under Section 3(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act. These investment securities, which include the loans that BlockFi made to counter parties, had a value exceeding 40% of its total assets as set forth in Section 3(a)(1)&#169; of the Investment Company Act. During these time periods, BlockFi was an issuer, was not registered as an investment company, and was not exempted or excluded from the Investment Company Act’s definition of an investment company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section 3(c)(2) of the Investment Company Act excludes from the definition of investment company any person that is “primarily engaged in the business of . . . acting as a market intermediary . . . whose gross income normally is derived principally from such business and related activities.” As defined in Section 3(c)(2)(B)(i), a “‘market intermediary’ is any person that regularly holds itself out as being willing contemporaneously to engage in, and that is regularly engaged in, the business of entering into transactions on both sides of the market for a financial contract or one or more such financial contracts,” and whose “gross income normally is derived principally from such business and related activities.” Under Section 3(c)(2)(B)(ii), “‘financial contract’ means any arrangement that (I) takes the form of an individually negotiated contract, agreement, or option to buy, sell, lend, swap, or repurchase, or other similar individually negotiated transaction commonly entered into by participants in the financial markets; (II) is in respect of securities, commodities, currencies, interest or other rates, other measures of value, or any other financial or economic interest similar in purpose or function to any of the foregoing; and (III) is entered into in response to a request from a counter party for a quotation, or is otherwise entered into and structured to accommodate the objectives of the counter party to such arrangement.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BlockFi did not satisfy the terms of the “market intermediary” exclusion under Section 3(c)(2) because it was not primarily engaged in the business of acting as a market intermediary; its principal source of gross income was not derived from intermediary business and related activities; and it did not regularly engage in the business of entering into transactions on both sides of the market for a financial contract. The BIAs, for example, were not “individually negotiated” financial contracts that were entered into in “response to a request from a counter party for a quotation” or structured to accommodate “the objectives of the counter party.” Moreover, BlockFi only intermittently entered into individually negotiated transactions to borrow crypto assets, and initiated and did not structure those transactions for the counter parties’ objectives. Consequently, neither the BIA nor BlockFi’s individually negotiated borrowings met the definition of financial contract in Section 3(c)(2), and so BlockFi was not regularly engaged in the business of entering into transactions on both sides of the market for a financial contract. BlockFi’s primary business was investing in investment securities, including institutional loans. Moreover, BlockFi did not meet any other statutory exemptions or exclusions from the definition of an investment company, or seek an order from the Commission declaring that it was primarily engaged in a business other than that of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, or exempting it from complying with any provisions of the Investment Company Act or the rules thereunder. For these reasons, and for the reasons set forth in paragraph 37 above, BlockFi was an investment company engaged in business in interstate
commerce.</p>

<li>
<p>Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes.

If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that it shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission&#8217;s counsel in this action and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action” means a private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this proceeding.</p>

<p><span class="underline"><strong>COMPLAINT</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Plaintiff, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), alleges as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>SUMMARY OF ACTION</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>This case concerns a brazen and far-reaching unregistered offering fraud conducted between at least 2018 and 2022 by Defendants Neil Chandran, Garry Davidson, Michael Glaspie, Linda Knott, Amy Mossel, Banner Co-Op, Inc. (“Banner Co-Op”), BannersGo, LLC (“BannersGo”), and AEO Publishing Inc. (“AEO Publishing”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chandran, a recidivist securities law violator and convicted felon, claimed to own a unique blockchain technology that was on the verge of being sold for trillions of dollars to a group of reputable billionaire buyers (“CoinDeal”). Chandran further claimed his business required interim financial support until the sale transaction closed. Together with and through other named Defendants, Chandran targeted mostly unsophisticated investors with false and misleading promises and representations that investments in CoinDeal would soon yield extremely high returns from the imminent sale of his business. Ultimately, there was no sale, and no distribution of proceeds, because CoinDeal was a sham.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given his criminal record, Chandran incentivized others such as Davidson (an investor in a prior Chandran scheme) and Glaspie (recruited by Davidson) to help raise funds for CoinDeal by soliciting public investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glaspie, an online promoter, raised large sums for CoinDeal from tens of thousands of investors in multiple states and countries. As part of his promotional campaign, Glaspie knowingly or recklessly disseminated false information about CoinDeal that he received from Chandran via Davidson, including information concerning the supposed value and timeline of the sale transaction, as well as the purported involvement of prominent business people, financial institutions and governmental departments or agencies. Glaspie regularly communicated such false information to investors through near-daily written updates and weekly teleconferences, in which Davidson occasionally participated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glaspie made additional misrepresentations and engaged in other fraudulent conduct, including by: creating and publicizing astronomical payout scales that ranged from multi-million dollar returns for investments of $1,000 or less, to returns in excess of $50 billion for investments of $100,000; offering referral bonuses to entice investors to recruit others to participate in CoinDeal; and personally guaranteeing to refund investors with 7% interest should CoinDeal not come to fruition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knott, who invested in CoinDeal through Glaspie and engaged in her own promotional activity, similarly fabricated payout scales with conspicuous rates of return and knowingly or recklessly disseminated false information about CoinDeal when soliciting prospective investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chandran, Davidson, Glaspie (with substantial assistance from his wife, Mossel, and her business entity, AEO Publishing) and Knott raised over $45 million through the fraudulent CoinDeal offering. Investor funds typically flowed into financial accounts held by Glaspie’s entities, Banner Co-Op and BannersGo, were then transferred to accounts controlled by Davidson, and ultimately routed to accounts controlled by Chandran. Knott pooled investor funds she raised, which totaled at least $749,000, before periodically transferring amounts to Glaspie. Neither Knott, Glaspie nor Davidson transferred all CoinDeal investor funds upstream – rather, each diverted investor funds for personal use along the way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collectively, Chandran, Davidson, Glaspie, and Knott misappropriated tens of millions of dollars of investor funds for personal use and diverted funds to individuals and entities unrelated to CoinDeal, including Mossel and AEO Publishing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result of their conduct, Chandran, Davidson, Glaspie, Knott, Banner Co-Op, and BannersGo intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly committed securities fraud and offered and sold unregistered securities. Mossel and AEO Publishing aided and abetted Glaspie’s violations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chandran, Davidson, Glaspie, Knott, Banner Co-Op, and BannersGo violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c), and 77q(a)] and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77o(b)] and Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78t(e)], Davidson, Glaspie, Knott, Banner Co-Op, and BannersGo aided and abetted Chandran’s violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Act and Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act, AEO Publishing and Mossel aided and abetted Glaspie’s violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SEC brings this lawsuit to prevent further harm to investors and to seek disgorgement, civil penalties, officer and director bars, permanent injunctions, and conduct-based injunctions stemming from the Defendants’ wrongdoing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the Defendants are permanently restrained and enjoined, they will continue to engage in the acts, practices, and courses of business set forth in this Complaint and in acts, practices, and courses of business of similar type and object.</p>

<p><strong>Neil S. Chandran</strong>, age 51, is currently imprisoned in Nebraska while awaiting trial. Chandran resided in California and Nevada during the relevant time period. Chandran managed at least four entities under the umbrella name Virse: ViMarket, Inc., ViDelivery, Inc., Studio Vi, Inc., and Free Vi Lab (collectively, the “Chandran Entities”). In 2006, California’s Department of Corporations ordered Chandran to desist and refrain from offering or selling securities in California. In 2015, the Alberta Securities Commission sanctioned Chandran and his company for engaging in unregistered trading and illegal securities offerings and fined him $460,000 CAD. In 2016, the Ontario Securities Commission entered a reciprocal order against Chandran, banning him from trading in securities and soliciting investors to trade in securities. In 2018, Chandran pled guilty to grand larceny and securities fraud in the state of New York and was ordered to pay $2,868,000. In June 2022, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) indicted Chandran for wire fraud and money laundering in connection with the CoinDeal scheme and obtained a court-ordered freeze of his assets. Chandran does not hold any securities licenses and has never registered with the SEC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Garry J. Davidson</strong>, age 68, resides in Henderson, Nevada. Davidson previously invested in another of Chandran’s purported business ventures and facilitated investments and payments in connection with CoinDeal and the Chandran Entities.

<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Chandran Created the “CoinDeal” Scheme</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="26">
<li>
<p>From at least 2018, Chandran repeatedly touted an investment opportunity that supposedly revolved around valuable blockchain technology he was far along in the process of selling to a group of wealthy buyers at a trillion-dollar valuation. Chandran sought short-term funding for business operating expenses during the completion of the purported sale process and promised investors substantial returns once the sale closed. This investment opportunity later became widely known to investors as “CoinDeal.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In reality, CoinDeal was merely the most recent iteration of Chandran’s prior fraudulent schemes. No such buyer group existed, there was no impending sale, and Chandran was incapable of producing the astronomical returns he promised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given the public record of his legal troubles, Chandran sought to utilize others to solicit investors on his behalf. Chandran turned to Davidson, an investor in one of his prior schemes who remained in contact with Chandran in hopes of recouping his prior investment. Davidson agreed to find others to invest, financially motivated by Chandran’s offer to pay him increased returns based on the amount he could raise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Davidson Recruited Glaspie and Served as a Go-Between for Chandran</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="29">
<li>
<p>Davidson sought avenues for fundraising and identified Glaspie through an internet search. In or around mid-2018, Davidson contacted Glaspie, based on Glaspie’s substantial online presence and reputed success with internet multi-level marketing programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Davidson presented the CoinDeal opportunity to Glaspie. Davidson described it as debt financing for a company involved with cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence that was pending sale. Davidson made Glaspie aware of Chandran’s involvement and offered Glaspie substantial returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Davidson and Glaspie had never met or spoken prior to this initial contact by Davidson. Nonetheless, Glaspie decided to invest and solicit others to invest in CoinDeal without conducting any independent research or other due diligence on Chandran, Davidson, or CoinDeal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specifically, Davidson and Glaspie agreed to solicit investments in CoinDeal from Glaspie’s expansive network of internet marketing contacts and to transfer monies raised from investors to Chandran and/or the Chandran Entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From 2018 to 2022, Davidson relayed information that he received from Chandran about CoinDeal to Glaspie to facilitate Glaspie’s solicitation efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chandran regularly used encrypted email, text messages, and phone calls to share with Davidson false and misleading information concerning CoinDeal. Chandran typically provided status updates on the supposed deal, including but not limited to: the involvement of foreign central banks and the United States Department of Homeland Security; the latest board meetings of the consortium of wealthy buyers; the role of certain political figures; and the causes of “temporary” delays to the sale closing. These updates were designed to lull investors and induce them to continue investing in CoinDeal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To distribute information received from Chandran via encrypted message, Davidson typically would copy and paste the latest supposed update regarding CoinDeal to an unencrypted email message to Glaspie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glaspie would then include the information received from Davidson in written and/or oral communications with investors and potential investors, such as “CoinDeal Updates” that were made available online and via email, and discussed during teleconferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, Chandran (<a href="mailto:cryptovirutal@hushmail.com">cryptovirutal@hushmail.com</a>) sent an encrypted email to Davidson (<a href="mailto:kgd526@gmail.com">kgd526@gmail.com</a>) on February 28, 2019, with the subject line: “Elite Sponsors : Statement Registration Requires Sign Off in SF ; Traveling to Obtain for Close of Business PST.”</p>

<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="38">
<li>
<p>On the same day, February 28, 2019, Davidson sent Glaspie an unencrypted email regarding an “update” with the information he had copied from Chandran’s email. As shown below, the email included information regarding the same subject of Chandran’s previous email, including travel to San Francisco for “statement registration”:</p>

<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="39">
<li>
<p>The very next day, in a March 1, 2019 “CoinDeal Update” communication, Glaspie shared with investors the same information he had received from Davidson the day before concerning “statement registration” in San Francisco:</p>

<ol class="arabic" start="40">
<li>
<p>The above-described pattern of communication between Chandran and Davidson, followed by communication between Davidson and Glaspie, followed by a CoinDeal investor update from Glapsie to investors, occurred regularly in the course of the CoinDeal offering.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Chandran, Davidson, and Glaspie Offered CoinDeal to Investors Through Glaspie’s Network</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="41">
<li>
<p>In or around January 2019, Glaspie began promoting the CoinDeal opportunity during weekly teleconferences that included over 100,000 invitees from his network of contacts. Glaspie explained that an unnamed Canadian resident had a very valuable (but anonymous) artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency company that was preparing for an imminent sale to a group of billionaire buyers. Glaspie further explained that the Canadian resident was unable to obtain conventional financing due to prior legal issues. Glaspie did not reveal that this unnamed individual was Chandran, and he also failed to disclose that this individual had a criminal history in the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Davidson participated in certain of these weekly teleconferences alongside Glaspie. Glaspie explained to investors that Davidson brought the opportunity to Glaspie and described him as a representative of CoinDeal. For example, during teleconferences held on March 7, 2020, and August 5, 2020, Glaspie referred to Davidson as a CoinDeal trustee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In or around January 2019, Glaspie also began making online posts and disseminating emails to solicit CoinDeal investments. The online posts and emails included materially false and misleading updates on CoinDeal based on information Glaspie received from Chandran via Davidson and a payout scale that promised investors outsized returns based on a given investment amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To attract prospective investors, Glaspie created his own payout scale using Chandran’s astronomical valuations of CoinDeal. Glaspie utilized a tiered payout scale by offering a higher return for larger investment amounts. As set forth below, Glaspie offered increasingly extravagant returns that grew from 10 times the investment amount in his updates from early 2019 to 500,000 times the investment amount in updates from late 2021.</p>

<div class="paragraph text-center">

</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="45">
<li>
<p>In promoting CoinDeal, Glaspie anticipated that large numbers of investors would jump at the opportunity to obtain a life-changing financial reward, particularly if it did not require much outlay of capital. Thus, despite having no legitimate basis for doing so, Glaspie published online dozens of different high rates of return that continued to grow over time to encourage investment in CoinDeal, even when the supposedly imminent transaction had yet to occur. Based on these promised payouts, investors were misled to expect millions and potentially billions in return for a comparatively small, short-term investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, on June 12, 2019, Glaspie published online a promise to pay returns of 20-to-1 (2000%) on investments in CoinDeal:</p>

<p><span class="underline"><strong>Chandran, Davidson, and Glaspie Repeatedly Fabricated Excuses for Why CoinDeal’s Closing Was Delayed</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="52">
<li>
<p>During the CoinDeal offering, Chandran, Davidson, and Glaspie repeatedly represented that CoinDeal was on the cusp of closing, purposefully misleading current and prospective investors to believe they could receive a large payout in a matter of days or weeks, not months or years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, on March 21, 2019, Glaspie stated in his online update that he expected CoinDeal to close later that day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On May 8, 2019, Glaspie stated in his online update that he expected CoinDeal to close the following day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On October 2, 2019, Glaspie stated in his online update that CoinDeal was expected to close that night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On April 11, 2020, Glaspie stated in his online update that CoinDeal would be closing within three days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On January 11, 2021, Glaspie stated in his online update that CoinDeal would be closing by January 13, 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without disclosing his full name, Chandran participated in at least one teleconference hosted by Glaspie on October 24, 2020, and told investors that CoinDeal’s closing was only a week or two away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CoinDeal, however, never existed and thus, by design, the deal never closed. Glaspie, based on information from Chandran (via Davidson), provided a continuous string of excuses for why closing did not occur. For example, on February 22, 2019, Glaspie falsely claimed in an online post that CoinDeal’s closing had been delayed due to a vendor company declaring bankruptcy:</p>

<p><span class="underline"><strong>Chandran, Davidson, and Glaspie Provided Investors With Additional False Information Regarding CoinDeal</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="64">
<li>
<p>Throughout the relevant time period, prospective investors were constantly flooded with opportunities to invest in CoinDeal. Glaspie continued hosting weekly teleconferences and disseminating written updates on a near-daily basis (and occasionally multiple times in one day) to promote CoinDeal and solicit funds until 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to false statements about the expected profitability of the CoinDeal transaction, related false promises of outsized investment returns, and myriad false excuses for why CoinDeal had not yet closed, Glaspie and Davidson directly made various other material misrepresentations to investors and prospective investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, based on information from Chandran, Davidson falsely stated, during a teleconference on March 6, 2021, that Billionaire 1 and Billionaire 2 were each under consideration as the potential CEO for the CoinDeal business enterprise. Billionaire 1 is the founder and executive chairman of a large online retailing company. Billionaire 2 is the CEO of an electric car company. During the same teleconference, Davidson falsely stated that CoinDeal had a market capitalization of $50 trillion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on information from Chandran (via Davidson), Glaspie similarly falsely stated in his June 7, 2021 online update that Billionaire 1 was a member of the billionaire buyers’ group that planned to purchase one or more Chandran Entities:</p>
</li>

</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="68">
<li>
<p>Based on information from Chandran (via Davidson), Glaspie falsely stated during a February 20, 2021 teleconference that Billionaire 2 was also a member of the buyers’ group that planned to purchase one or more Chandran Entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glaspie also falsely claimed that he was under a strict non-disclosure agreement, which prevented him from disclosing the name of the seller, the names of the buyers, and the name of the company. In reality, this was merely another ruse to avoid scrutiny, as no such non-disclosure agreement existed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glaspie went so far as to falsely deny Chandran’s involvement. When investors asked Glaspie whether Chandran was the seller behind CoinDeal, Glaspie denied Chandran’s role in the scheme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, on or about August 19, 2021, a prospective CoinDeal investor shared a link containing information about Chandran’s 2018 criminal charges and asked Glaspie to “confirm that Neil Chandran is NOT the seller of this transaction.” In response, Glaspie denied that Chandran was involved, admonished the individual for “spreading rumors,” and further stated: “Please make this the last email on this topic [as] I just don[’]t have time for this disrupting email.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By way of further example, on or about September 3, 2021, Glaspie again denied Chandran’s involvement in CoinDeal to a prospective investor. On this occasion, the concerned individual told Glaspie: “I have been doing some digging around the internet. Some people say that ‘Neil’ the owner, is actually convicted fraudster Neil Chandran. Please tell me that’s not true.” The individual further described finding “red flags” when searching Chandran’s name on the internet. In response, Glaspie stated: “[W]here these rumors start is a mystery to me. The owner is NOT the man u think he is.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glaspie also lured investors through false guarantees to investors that he would repay all amounts invested in CoinDeal with 7% interest within three years if the CoinDeal sale transaction did not occur. In reality, Glaspie did not have the financial resources to make any such guarantee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For instance, on November 16, 2020, Glaspie published online in a written update his guarantee to pay 7% interest on all amounts invested in CoinDeal.</p>

<ol class="arabic" start="75">
<li>
<p>To entice further investment, Glaspie offered referral bonuses for investors who raised additional funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, Glaspie published online a 25% referral bonus offer in his October 19, 2020 update:</p>

<p><span class="underline"><strong>CoinDeal Investor Funds Flowed Through the Glaspie Entities to Davidson, Chandran, and the Chandran Entities</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="78">
<li>
<p>At Glaspie’s direction, investors participated in the CoinDeal offering through the Glaspie Entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glaspie instructed investors to send payments for CoinDeal investments to bank accounts in the name of his entities, Banner Co-Op and BannersGo, which he promised to investors he would pass along to Davidson for CoinDeal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Glaspie Entities received CoinDeal investor funds at certain bank institutions, some of which were located in Michigan. Investors’ funds were commingled and transferred to other accounts controlled by Glaspie and his wife, Mossel, including accounts in the name of Mossel’s company, AEO Publishing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At Davidson’s instruction, Glaspie and/or Mossel caused the transfer of investor funds, held in accounts in the name of the Glaspie Entities and AEO Publishing, to specified bank accounts controlled by Davidson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At Chandran’s direction, Davidson transferred the funds upstream to Chandran, the Chandran Entities, and Chandran’s associates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certain funds were also transferred directly from the Glaspie Entities to Chandran and the Chandran Entities following the closure of certain of Davidson’s bank accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From 2019 to 2022, Glaspie, through the Glaspie Entities, raised over $45 million, as well additional amounts via crypto assets, from thousands of CoinDeal investors from multiple states and countries.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Defendants Misappropriated Investor Funds</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="85">
<li>
<p>Defendants failed to disclose to investors that funds invested in CoinDeal would be used for purposes unrelated to CoinDeal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chandran received at least $37 million in investor funds for CoinDeal. Chandran and the Chandran Entities misappropriated investors’ funds to purchase, among other items, a fleet of luxury vehicles, various real estate properties in California and Nevada, and a boat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Glaspie Entities were controlled by Glaspie, and, unbeknownst to investors, he determined how investor funds would be used upon receipt, including for his own personal use. Glaspie, through the Glaspie Entities, misappropriated approximately $5.9 million or more by transferring investor funds to other accounts that he and Mossel controlled that were unrelated to CoinDeal and by directly paying his and Mossel’s personal expenses. Glaspie used investors’ funds to contribute over $100,000 to an insurance policy for his son and to contribute $800,000 to an annuity policy in Mossel’s name. Glaspie also used investor funds to cover operating expenses for the Glaspie Entities and transferred millions to his associates to pay salaries and for other business ventures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Davidson misappropriated at least $3 million of investors’ funds. Among other misuse of investor funds, Davidson purchased a $150,000 mobile home and used investor funds for personal living expenses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Mossel and AEO Publishing Substantially Assisted the CoinDeal Scheme</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="89">
<li>
<p>Mossel was aware of Glaspie’s efforts to raise funds for CoinDeal and substantially assisted him in furthering the scheme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glaspie typically dictated his investor updates regarding CoinDeal to Mossel who would then post the updates online and circulate them via email. Mossel knew, recklessly disregarded, should have known, or consciously avoided knowing that the information and promises contained in Glaspie’s online updates were false and misleading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mossel served as a bookkeeper for the Glaspie Entities. Mossel issued invoices to CoinDeal investors on behalf of the Glaspie Entities and collected and commingled investor funds in bank accounts held in the name of Banner Co-Op, BannersGo, and her own company, AEO Publishing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In her role as bookkeeper, Mossel regularly communicated with investors regarding the amount of their investments and potential payouts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mossel also transferred investor funds to Davidson and the Chandran Entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glaspie and Mossel diverted at least $1 million of investors’ funds to Mossel and AEO Publishing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Knott Also Engaged in the CoinDeal Offering Fraud Through Her Own Promotional Activities</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="89">
<li>
<p>Glaspie’s widespread marketing of CoinDeal and his offer of referral bonuses attracted promoters who established their own investor groups. These promoters would pool investor funds to reach higher levels on Glaspie’s tiered payout scale and obtain larger referral bonuses. One such promoter was Linda Knott.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In February 2021, Knott learned of CoinDeal through one of Glaspie’s teleconferences and decided to invest $1,000. Knott did not know of Glaspie before listening to the teleconference, and Knott did not conduct any independent research on Glaspie or CoinDeal before investing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After learning of the aforementioned payout scale and referral bonuses promised by Glaspie, Knott started collecting funds for CoinDeal through an investor group called Together We Profit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Together We Profit was a loose arrangement of individuals interested in participating in CoinDeal. Knott instructed members to send funds to accounts controlled by Knott, which she represented would be transferred to Glaspie for investing in CoinDeal. During the relevant time period, Together We Profit grew to approximately 10,000 members from multiple states and countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar to Glaspie, Knott disseminated email updates and hosted teleconferences concerning CoinDeal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In written updates and during teleconferences with current and potential investors, Knott repeated misrepresentations made in Glaspie’s written CoinDeal updates and teleconferences, including misrepresentations regarding the involvement of prominent billionaire buyers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knott also repeated Glaspie’s baseless guarantee that CoinDeal investors would receive a full refund with 7% interest if the sale did not occur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knott facilitated investment by lowering the barrier to entry for CoinDeal by allowing prospective investors to participate for as little as $27, which was lower than the amounts permitted by Glaspie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knott created and disseminated her own payout scale to attract investors, including in emails and online posts in October and November 2021. Knott’s advertised payout scale grew over time from payouts of $500,000 for each $27 investment, to payouts of $14 million for each $27 investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During 2021, Knott raised at least $749,000 in fiat currency and additional amounts in crypto currency from thousands of investors from multiple states, including Michigan, and multiple countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While Knott assured investors she would transmit all of their funds to CoinDeal, that was false. She enriched herself by misappropriating approximately $79,000 or more for personal use and purposes unrelated to CoinDeal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Defendants Continued the Fraudulent CoinDeal Offering Even After State Authorities Ordered Them to Cease and Desist</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="106">
<li>
<p>In January 2020, LARA ordered Glaspie and Banner Co-Op to cease and desist from offering or selling unregistered securities in Michigan in connection with CoinDeal. In June 2020, Glaspie settled by agreeing to cease and desist and paying a $15,000 fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nevertheless, Glaspie continued offering and selling securities to investors in Michigan for CoinDeal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In October 2021, the Michigan Department of Attorney General obtained an injunction against Glaspie and Banner Co-Op for their failure to abide by the June 2020 consent order. The judgment prohibited Glaspie and Banner Co-Op from continuing to solicit funds from and offering investment opportunities to Michigan residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On June 1, 2022, the Alabama Securities Commission ordered Glaspie, Davidson, and Banner Co-Op to cease and desist from offering or selling securities in Alabama.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite these actions by state regulatory authorities, Glaspie and Davidson continued to accept investor funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2021, Knott became aware of LARA’s cease-and-desist order and received warnings from a Glaspie associate about the legal ramifications of accepting funds from Michigan investors. Nonetheless, Knott created a workaround.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In September 2021, Knott addressed prospective Michigan investors and informed them that she, in lieu of Glaspie, would accept their funds for a higher fee ($30) through a separate company she had created:</p>

<li>
<p>In April 2022, LARA ordered Knott d/b/a Together We Profit to cease and desist from offering or selling unregistered securities in Michigan. In August 2022, Knott stipulated to a cease-and-desist order and a $10,000 fine.</p>

<p><span class="underline"><strong>The CoinDeal Scheme Collapses</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="114">
<li>
<p>In June 2022, the CoinDeal scheme largely collapsed when the DOJ indicted Chandran for wire fraud and money laundering violations and froze his assets. USA v. Chandran, Case No. 22-cr-03077 (D. Neb. 2022). The indictment described a scheme to defraud carried out by Chandran, in which he caused others to solicit funds from investors based on the false and misleading portrayal that their investments would soon yield extremely high returns upon the purchase of one or more of his entities by a wealthy buyer group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even after Chandran’s arrest, Glaspie continued to lull investors with confounding rationalizations about the purported legitimacy and ongoing viability of CoinDeal. For example, on June 30, 2022, Glaspie published online the following update:</p>

<p>The Defendants recruited potential investors through teleconferences, online posts, and email.</p>

<p>The Defendants made no efforts to assess potential investors’ sophistication or accreditation status, and unaccredited investors participated in the CoinDeal offering. Many investors had no preexisting relationship with the Defendants.</p>

<p><strong>Alleged Fraudulent Blockchain Scheme Spanned Multiple Countries Including U.S., Russia</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Washington D.C., Aug. 1, 2022 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged 11 individuals for their roles in creating and promoting Forsage, a fraudulent crypto pyramid and Ponzi scheme that raised more than $300 million from millions of retail investors worldwide, including in the United States. Those charged include the four founders of Forsage, who were last known to be living in Russia, the Republic of Georgia, and Indonesia, as well as three U.S.-based promoters engaged by the founders to endorse Forsage on its website and social media platforms, and several members of the so-called Crypto Crusaders—the largest promotional group for the scheme that operated in the United States from at least five different states.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>According to the SEC’s complaint, in January 2020, Vladimir Okhotnikov, Jane Doe a/k/a Lola Ferrari, Mikhail Sergeev, and Sergey Maslakov launched Forsage.io, a website that allowed millions of retail investors to enter into transactions via smart contracts that operated on the Ethereum, Tron, and Binance blockchains. However, Forsage allegedly has operated as a pyramid scheme for more than two years, in which investors earned profits by recruiting others into the scheme.  Forsage also allegedly used assets from new investors to pay earlier investors in a typical Ponzi structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Despite cease-and-desist actions against Forsage for operating as a fraud in September 2020 by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines and in March 2021 by the Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance, the defendants allegedly continued to promote the scheme while denying the claims in several YouTube videos and by other means.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>"As the complaint alleges, Forsage is a fraudulent pyramid scheme launched on a massive scale and aggressively marketed to investors," said Carolyn Welshhans, Acting Chief of the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. "Fraudsters cannot circumvent the federal securities laws by focusing their schemes on smart contracts and blockchains."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In addition to charging the four founders, the complaint, filed in United States District Court in the Northern District of Illinois, also charges Cheri Beth Bowen, of Pelahatchie, Miss., Ronald R. Deering, of Coeur d’ Alene, Idaho, Samuel D. Ellis, of Louisville, Ky., Mark F. Hamlin, of Henrico, Va., Carlos L. Martinez, of Chicago, Ill., Alisha R. Shepperd, of Dunedin, Fla., and Sarah L. Theissen, of Hartford, Wis., with violating the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC’s complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil penalties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Without admitting or denying the allegations, two of the defendants, Ellis and Theissen, agreed to settle the charges and to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the charged provisions and certain other activity. Additionally, Ellis agreed to pay disgorgement and civil penalties, and Theissen will be required to pay disgorgement and civil penalties as determined by the court. Both settlements are subject to court approval.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Liz Canizares and Pamela Sawhney of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and supervised by Amy Friedman and Ms. Welshhans. The litigation is being conducted by Patrick Costello, Christopher Carney, Ms. Canizares, and Ms. Sawhney and supervised by Olivia Choe. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines and the Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance.</p>

<p><strong>Defendant Allegedly Traded on Inside Information About NFTs That Were Scheduled to be Featured on The Homepage of The Largest NFT Marketplace</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Michael J. Driscoll, Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), announced today the unsealing of an Indictment charging NATHANIEL CHASTAIN, a former product manager at Ozone Networks, Inc. d/b/a OpenSea (“OpenSea”), with wire fraud and money laundering in connection with a scheme to commit insider trading in Non-Fungible Tokens, or “NFTs,” by using confidential information about what NFTs were going to be featured on OpenSea&#8217;s homepage for his personal financial gain.  CHASTAIN was arrested this morning in New York, New York and will be presented today in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said:  “NFTs might be new, but this type of criminal scheme is not.  As alleged, Nathaniel Chastain betrayed OpenSea by using its confidential business information to make money for himself.  Today&#8217;s charges demonstrate the commitment of this Office to stamping out insider trading&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;whether it occurs on the stock market or the blockchain.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Michael J. Driscoll said:  “In this case, as alleged, Chastain launched an age-old scheme to commit insider trading by using his knowledge of confidential information to purchase dozens of NFTs in advance of them being featured on OpenSea&#8217;s homepage. With the emergence of any new investment tool, such as blockchain supported non-fungible tokens, there are those who will exploit vulnerabilities for their own gain. The FBI will continue to aggressively pursue actors who choose to manipulate the market in this way.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As alleged in the Indictment unsealed today in Manhattan federal court:<a href="#doj_insider_trading_fn_1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>This case concerns insider trading in NFTs on OpenSea, the largest online marketplace for the purchase and sale of NFTs. In violation of the duties of trust and confidence he owed to his employer, OpenSea, CHASTAIN exploited his advanced knowledge of what NFTs would be featured on OpenSea&#8217;s homepage for his personal financial gain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>As part of his employment, CHASTAIN was responsible for selecting NFTs to be featured on OpenSea&#8217;s homepage. OpenSea kept confidential the identity of featured NFTs until they appeared on its homepage. After an NFT was featured on OpenSea&#8217;s homepage, the price buyers were willing to pay for that NFT, and for other NFTs made by the same NFT creator, typically increased substantially.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>From at least in or about June 2021 to at least in or about September 2021, CHASTAIN used OpenSea&#8217;s confidential business information about what NFTs were going to be featured on its homepage to secretly purchase dozens of NFTs shortly before they were featured. After those NFTs were featured on OpenSea, CHASTAIN sold them at profits of two- to five-times his initial purchase price. To conceal the fraud, CHASTAIN conducted these purchases and sales using anonymous digital currency wallets and anonymous accounts on OpenSea.</p>

<p><strong>Ishan Wahi Tipped His Associates Regarding Crypto Assets That Were Going To Be Listed On Coinbase Exchanges</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today that ISHAN WAHI, a former product manager at Coinbase Global, Inc. (“Coinbase”), pled guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with a scheme to commit insider trading in cryptocurrency assets by using confidential Coinbase information about which crypto assets were scheduled to be listed on Coinbase’s exchanges.  WAHI was arrested and charged in July 2022 and pled guilty earlier today before U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Ishan Wahi – a former Coinbase product manager – admitted in court today that he tipped others regarding Coinbase’s planned token listings so that they could trade in crypto assets for a profit.  Wahi is the first insider to admit guilt in an insider trading case involving the cryptocurrency markets.  Whether it occurs in the equity markets or the crypto markets, stealing confidential business information for your own personal profit or the profit of others is a serious federal crime.  The Southern District of New York has decades of experience pursuing insider trading cases, and we will continue to use our expertise to prosecute this crime no matter what form it takes and where it occurs.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>According to the allegations in the Indictment and statements made in public court proceedings:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>At all relevant times, Coinbase was one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.  Coinbase users could acquire, exchange, and sell various crypto assets through online user accounts with Coinbase.  Periodically, Coinbase added new crypto assets to those that could be traded through its exchange, and the market value of crypto assets typically significantly increased after Coinbase announced that it would be listing a particular crypto asset.  Accordingly, Coinbase kept such information strictly confidential and prohibited its employees from sharing that information with others, including by providing a “tip” to any person who might trade based on that information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Beginning in approximately October 2020, ISHAN WAHI worked at Coinbase as a product manager assigned to a Coinbase asset listing team.  In that role, WAHI was involved in the highly confidential process of listing crypto assets on Coinbase’s exchanges and had detailed and advanced knowledge of which crypto assets Coinbase was planning to list and the timing of public announcements about those crypto asset listings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>On multiple occasions between June 2021 and April 2022, WAHI violated his duties of trust and confidence to Coinbase by providing confidential business information that he learned in connection with his employment at Coinbase to Nikhil Wahi and Sameer Ramani so that they could secretly engage in profitable trades around public announcements by Coinbase that it would be listing certain crypto assets on Coinbase’s exchanges.  Following Coinbase’s public listing announcements, on multiple occasions, Nikhil Wahi and Ramani sold the crypto assets for a profit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>On April 12, 2022, a Twitter account that is well known in the crypto community tweeted regarding an Ethereum blockchain wallet “that bought hundreds of thousands of dollars of tokens exclusively featured in the Coinbase Asset Listing post about 24 hours before it was published.”  The trading activity referenced in the April 12 tweet was trading previously conducted by Ramani based on tips provided by WAHI.  Coinbase thereafter publicly replied on Twitter, noting that it had already begun investigating the matter and, a few weeks later, stated in a public blog post that any Coinbase employee who leaked confidential company information would be “immediately terminated and referred to relevant authorities (potentially for criminal prosecution).”  On May 11, 2022, Coinbase’s director of security operations emailed WAHI to inform him that he should appear for an in-person meeting relating to Coinbase’s asset listing process at Coinbase’s Seattle, Washington, office on May 16, 2022.  WAHI confirmed he would attend the meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>On the evening of May 15, 2022, WAHI purchased a one-way flight to India that was scheduled to depart the next day shortly before WAHI was supposed to be interviewed by Coinbase.  In the hours between booking the flight and his scheduled departure, WAHI called and texted Nikhil Wahi and Ramani about Coinbase’s investigation and sent both of them a photograph of the messages he had received on May 11, 2022, from Coinbase’s director of security operations.  Prior to boarding the May 16, 2022, flight to India, WAHI was stopped by law enforcement and prevented from leaving the country.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p>&ast;&emsp;&emsp;&ast;&emsp;&emsp; &ast;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>ISHAN WAHI, 32, of Seattle, Washington, pled guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which each carry, respectively, a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The statutory maximum sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by a judge.  WAHI is scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Preska on May 10, 2023, at 12:00 p.m.</p>
</div>

<p><em>Additional Lazarus Group Virtual Wallet Addresses Identified</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned virtual currency mixer Blender.io (Blender), which is used by the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to support its malicious cyber activities and money-laundering of stolen virtual currency. On March 23, 2022, Lazarus Group, a DPRK state-sponsored cyber hacking group, carried out the largest virtual currency heist to date, worth almost $620 million, from a blockchain project linked to the online game Axie Infinity; Blender was used in processing over $20.5 million of the illicit proceeds. Under the pressure of robust U.S. and UN sanctions, the DPRK has resorted to illicit activities, including cyber-enabled heists from cryptocurrency exchanges and financial institutions, to generate revenue for its unlawful weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>“Today, for the first time ever, Treasury is sanctioning a virtual currency mixer,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson. “Virtual currency mixers that assist illicit transactions pose a threat to U.S. national security interests. We are taking action against illicit financial activity by the DPRK and will not allow state-sponsored thievery and its money-laundering enablers to go unanswered.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Treasury is also updating the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) to identify additional virtual currency addresses used by the Lazarus Group to launder illicit proceeds.  Treasury is committed to exposing components of the virtual currency ecosystem, like Blender, that are critical to the obfuscation of the trail of stolen proceeds from illicit cyber activity. OFAC sanctioned the Lazarus Group on September 13, 2019, pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13722, and identified it as an agency, instrumentality, or controlled entity of the Government of the DPRK, based on its relationship to the U.S.- and UN-designated Reconnaissance General Bureau, the DPRK&#8217;s premiere intelligence organization, which is also involved in conventional arms trade.</p>

<p><strong>Blender.io</strong> (Blender) is a virtual currency mixer that operates on the Bitcoin blockchain and indiscriminately facilitates illicit transactions by obfuscating their origin, destination, and counterparties. Blender receives a variety of transactions and mixes them together before transmitting them to their ultimate destinations. While the purported purpose is to increase privacy, mixers like Blender are commonly used by illicit actors. Blender has helped transfer more than $500 million worth of Bitcoin since its creation in 2017. Blender was used in the laundering process for DPRK&#8217;s Axie Infinity heist, processing over $20.5 million in illicit proceeds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">

Blender is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, a cyber-enabled activity originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States that is reasonably likely to result in, or has materially contributed to, a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States and that has the purpose or effect of causing a significant misappropriation of funds or economic resources, trade secrets, personal identifiers, or financial information for commercial or competitive advantage or private financial gain.</p>

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>While most virtual currency activity is licit, it can be used for illicit activity, including sanctions evasion, through mixers, peer-to-peer exchangers, darknet markets, and exchanges. This includes the facilitation of heists, ransomware schemes, and other cybercrimes. Treasury continues to use its authorities against malicious cyber actors in concert with other U.S. departments and agencies, as well as our foreign partners, to disrupt financial nodes tied to illicit payments and cyber-attacks. Those in the virtual currency industry play a critical role in implementing appropriate Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) and sanctions controls to prevent sanctioned persons and other illicit actors from exploiting virtual currency to undermine U.S foreign policy and national security interests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The virtual currency mixers that assist criminals are a threat to U.S. national security interests. Treasury will continue to investigate the use of mixers for illicit purposes and consider the range of authorities Treasury has to respond to illicit financing risks in the virtual currency ecosystem. For example, in 2020, <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement_action/2020-10-19/HarmonHelix%20Assessment%20and%20SoF_508_101920.pdf"> Treasury&#8217;s Financial Crime Enforcement Network (FinCEN) assessed a $60 million civil money penalty</a> against the owner and operator of a virtual currency mixer for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and its implementing regulations.

<p>WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned virtual currency mixer Tornado Cash, which has been used to launder more than $7 billion worth of virtual currency since its creation in 2019. This includes over $455 million stolen by the Lazarus Group, a Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) state-sponsored hacking group that was <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm774">sanctioned by the U.S. in 2019</a>, in the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-attribution-of-malicious-cyber-activity-posed-by-the-democratic-peoples-republic-of-korea">largest known virtual currency heist to date</a>. Tornado Cash was subsequently used to launder more than $96 million of malicious cyber actors’ funds derived from the June 24, 2022 Harmony Bridge Heist, and at least $7.8 million from the August 2, 2022 Nomad Heist. Today’s action is being taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended, and follows <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0768">OFAC’s May 6, 2022 designation of virtual currency mixer Blender.io (Blender)</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>“Today, Treasury is sanctioning Tornado Cash, a virtual currency mixer that launders the proceeds of cybercrimes, including those committed against victims in the United States,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson. “Despite public assurances otherwise, Tornado Cash has repeatedly failed to impose effective controls designed to stop it from laundering funds for malicious cyber actors on a regular basis and without basic measures to address its risks. Treasury will continue to aggressively pursue actions against mixers that launder virtual currency for criminals and those who assist them.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Treasury has worked to expose components of the virtual currency ecosystem, like Tornado Cash and Blender.io, that cybercriminals use to obfuscate the proceeds from illicit cyber activity and other crimes. While most virtual currency activity is licit, it can be used for illicit activity, including sanctions evasion through mixers, peer-to-peer exchangers, darknet markets, and exchanges. This includes the facilitation of heists, ransomware schemes, fraud, and other cybercrimes.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>MIXER: TORNADO CASH</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Tornado Cash (Tornado) is a virtual currency mixer that operates on the Ethereum blockchain and indiscriminately facilitates anonymous transactions by obfuscating their origin, destination, and counterparties, with no attempt to determine their origin. Tornado receives a variety of transactions and mixes them together before transmitting them to their individual recipients. While the purported purpose is to increase privacy, mixers like Tornado are commonly used by illicit actors to launder funds, especially those stolen during significant heists.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Tornado is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, a cyber-enabled activity originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States that is reasonably likely to result in, or has materially contributed to, a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States and that has the purpose or effect of causing a significant misappropriation of funds or economic resources, trade secrets, personal identifiers, or financial information for commercial or competitive advantage or private financial gain.</p>

<p><strong>ILLICIT FINANCE RISKS</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Virtual currency mixers that assist criminals are a threat to U.S. national security. Treasury will continue to investigate the use of mixers for illicit purposes and use its authorities to respond to illicit financing risks in the virtual currency ecosystem</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Criminals have increased their use of anonymity-enhancing technologies, including mixers, to help hide the movement or origin of funds.

</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Those in the virtual currency industry play a critical role in complying with their Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) and sanctions obligations to prevent sanctioned persons and other illicit actors from exploiting virtual currency to undermine U.S foreign policy and national security interests. As part of that effort, the industry should take a risk-based approach to assess the risk associated with different virtual currency services, implement measures to mitigate risks, and address the challenges anonymizing features can present to compliance with AML/CFT obligations. As today’s action demonstrates, mixers should in general be considered as high-risk by virtual currency firms, which should only process transactions if they have appropriate controls in place to prevent mixers from being used to launder illicit proceeds.</p>

<p><strong>SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS</strong></p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), for its complaint
against Caroline Ellison (“Ellison”) and Zixiao “Gary” Wang (“Wang,” together with Ellison,
“Defendants”), alleges as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="1">
<li>
<p>From at least May 2019 through November 2022, Defendants, together with Samuel Bankman-Fried (“Bankman-Fried”) and others, engaged in a scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX Trading Ltd. (“FTX”), the crypto asset trading platform of which Bankman-Fried and Wang were co-founders, at the same time that they were also defrauding the platform’s customers.<a href="#ellison_wang_footnote_1"><strong><sup><em>(1)</em></sup></strong></a> FTX raised more than $1.8 billion from investors, including U.S. investors, who bought an equity stake in FTX believing that FTX had appropriate controls and risk management measures. Unbeknownst to those investors (and to FTX’s trading customers), Bankman-Fried was orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud, diverting billions of dollars of the trading platform’s customer funds for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire. Defendants were active participants in the scheme and engaged in conduct that was critical to its success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout this period, Bankman-Fried portrayed himself as a responsible leader of the crypto community. He touted the importance of regulation and accountability. He told the public, including investors, that FTX was both innovative and responsible. Customers around the world believed his lies, and sent billions of dollars to FTX, believing their assets were secure on the FTX trading platform. But Bankman-Fried and Wang improperly diverted customer assets to Alameda Research LLC and its subsidiaries (“Alameda”), the crypto asset hedge fund that they had founded and co-owned and that Ellison ran. Wang created and participated in the creation of the software code that allowed Alameda to divert FTX customer funds. Ellison, in turn, used the misappropriated FTX customer funds for Alameda’s trading activity. And Bankman-Fried used those customer funds to make undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working with Bankman-Fried, Defendants hid the scheme from FTX’s equity investors, including U.S. investors, from whom FTX sought to raise billions of dollars in additional funds. Bankman-Fried repeatedly cast FTX as an innovative and conservative trailblazer in the crypto markets. He told investors and prospective investors that FTX had topnotch, sophisticated automated risk measures in place to protect customer assets, that those assets were safe and secure, and that Alameda was just another platform customer with no special privileges. Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that these statements were false and misleading. In truth, Bankman-Fried and Wang, with Ellison’s knowledge and consent, had exempted Alameda from the risk mitigation measures and had provided Alameda with significant special treatment on the FTX platform, including a virtually unlimited “line of credit” funded by the platform’s customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beyond its “line of credit” with FTX, Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, caused Alameda to borrow billions of dollars from third party lenders. Those loans were backed in significant part by Alameda’s holdings of FTT—an illiquid crypto asset security that was issued by FTX and provided to Alameda at no cost. Ellison, acting at the direction of Bankman-Fried, engaged in automated purchases of FTT tokens on various platforms in order to increase the price of those tokens and inflate the value of Alameda’s collateral, which allowed Alameda to borrow even more money from external lenders at increased risk to the lenders and to FTX’s investors and customers, all in furtherance of the scheme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While Bankman-Fried spent lavishly on office space and condominiums in The Bahamas, and sank billions of dollars of customer funds into speculative venture investments, his house of cards began to crumble. When prices of crypto assets plummeted in May 2022, Alameda’s lenders demanded repayment on billions of dollars of loans. Despite the fact that
Alameda had, by this point, already taken billions of dollars of FTX customer assets, it was unable to satisfy its loan obligations. Bankman-Fried, with Defendants’ knowledge, directed FTX to divert billions more in customer assets to Alameda to ensure that Alameda maintained its lending relationships, and that money could continue to flow in from lenders and other investors. Ellison then used FTX’s customer assets to pay Alameda’s debts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even as it was increasingly clear that Alameda and FTX could not make customers whole, Bankman-Fried and Defendants continued to misappropriate FTX customer funds. Through the summer of 2022, Bankman-Fried, with Defendants’ knowledge, directed hundreds of millions more in FTX customer funds to Alameda, which he then used for additional venture investments and for “loans” to himself and other FTX executives, including Wang. All the while, Bankman-Fried continued to make misleading statements to investors about FTX’s financial condition and risk management. Defendants were aware that Bankman-Fried was making these statements, and knew or were reckless in not knowing that they were false and misleading. Even in November 2022, faced with billions of dollars in customer withdrawal demands that FTX could not fulfill, Bankman-Fried and Ellison, with Wang’s knowledge, misled investors from whom they needed money to plug a multi-billion-dollar hole. This brazen, multiyear scheme finally came to an end when FTX, Alameda, and their tangled web of affiliated entities filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022.</p>

</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="18">
<li>
<p>In or around October 2017, Bankman-Fried and Wang founded Alameda, a quantitative trading firm specializing in crypto assets. <a href="#ellison_wang_footnote_3"><strong><sup><em>(3)</em></sup></strong></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At inception, Alameda was focused on arbitrage trading strategies, but went on to employ other strategies including market making, yield farming (pooling of crypto assets in exchange for interest or other rewards), and volatility trading. Alameda also offered over-thecounter trading services, and made and managed other debt and equity investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At first, Bankman-Fried was responsible for trading operations, and Wang handled the engineering and programming functions. Over time, Alameda hired additional employees, including Singh (in or around December 2017), Ellison (in or around March 2018), and Trabucco (in or around 2019). By the end of 2021, Alameda had approximately 30 employees. At times, Alameda shared office space and employees with FTX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried remained the ultimate decision-maker at Alameda, even after Ellison and Trabucco became co-CEOs in or around October 2021. Bankman-Fried directed investment and operational decisions, frequently communicated with Alameda employees, and had full access to Alameda’s records and databases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ellison was a trader at Alameda during the time Bankman-Fried acted as CEO. When Ellison became co-CEO in 2021, and continuing through November 2022, Ellison was responsible for Alameda’s day-to-day operations. Though Ellison made some trading decisions, she frequently consulted with Bankman-Fried, particularly about strategic issues and significant trades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In or around 2018, Bankman-Fried began work on building a crypto asset trading platform. Together with Wang and Singh, Bankman-Fried ultimately founded FTX, which began operations in or around May 2019.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX offered its customers a number of services. For example:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>FTX offered a “spot market,” a trading platform through which customers could trade crypto assets with other FTX customers in exchange for fiat currency (i.e., currency such as U.S. Dollars) or other crypto assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX offered “spot margin trading” services, which allowed FTX customers to trade using assets they did not have (i.e., to trade “on margin”) by posting collateral in their FTX accounts and borrowing crypto assets through the “spot market” on the FTX platform. FTX also allowed customers to lend their crypto assets to other FTX customers who would then use those crypto assets to spot trade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX offered an off-platform (over-the-counter or “OTC”) portal that enabled customers to connect and request quotes for spot crypto assets and to conduct trades.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried was the ultimate decision-maker at FTX from the platform’s inception in or around May 2019 until he resigned as CEO on or about November 11, 2022 (“the Relevant Period”). Wang and Singh were the lead engineers responsible for writing the software code for FTX, including the code that allowed for the services described above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In or around January 2020, Bankman-Fried, Wang, and Singh founded FTX US, a crypto asset trading platform designed primarily for customers in the United States.<a href="#ellison_wang_footnote_4"><strong><sup><em>(4)</em></sup></strong></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over time, Bankman-Fried expanded his holdings to include a number of companies focused on making and managing private (or “venture”) investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This interconnected web of companies grew to include over 100 separate entities, with Bankman-Fried at the top and Alameda, his crypto hedge fund, at the center.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the Relevant Period, in multiple public statements, Bankman-Fried held himself out as a visionary leader in the crypto industry, and touted his efforts to create a regulated and thriving crypto asset market. He conducted an intensive public relations campaign to brand himself and his companies as honest stewards of crypto.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reality was very different: From the start, contrary to what FTX investors and trading customers were told, Bankman-Fried, actively supported by Defendants, continually diverted FTX customer funds to Alameda and then used those funds to continue to grow his empire, using billions of dollars to make undisclosed private venture investments, political contributions, and real estate purchases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, throughout the Relevant Period, Bankman-Fried, with Defendants’ knowledge, solicited equity investors by touting FTX’s controls and risk management, ultimately raising at least $1.8 billion from investors in exchange for various classes of stock in FTX through multiple fundraising rounds, including raising: (1) approximately $8 million from the sale of shares of FTX Series A preferred stock, with fundraising completed in or around August 2019; (2) approximately $1 billion from the sale of shares of FTX Series B preferred stock, with fundraising completed in or around July 2021; (3) approximately $420 million from the sale of shares of FTX Series B-1 stock, with fundraising completed in or around October 2021; and (4) approximately $500 million from the sale of shares of FTX Series C stock, with fundraising completed in or around January 2022. Of this total, approximately $1.1 billion was invested in FTX by approximately 90 investors based in the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the entire span of the Relevant Period, while raising money from equity investors, Bankman-Fried, and those speaking at his direction and on his behalf, with the knowledge of Defendants, claimed in widely distributed public forums and directly to investors that: FTX was a safe crypto asset trading platform; FTX had a comparative advantage due to its automated risk mitigation procedures; and FTX and its customers were protected from other customers’ losses due to FTX’s automated liquidation process. As discussed further herein, these statements and others were misleading in light of Bankman-Fried’s failure to disclose to FTX investors the diversion of FTX customer funds to Alameda, which he then used for his own purposes, including loans to himself. Similarly, Bankman-Fried’s statements concerning the separation of FTX and Alameda, made throughout the Relevant Period, were misleading because he did not disclose the special treatment afforded to Alameda on FTX, including its virtually unlimited “line of credit” at FTX, its ability to carry a negative balance in its FTX customer account, and its exemption from FTX’s automated liquidation process—none of which any other customer of the platform enjoyed, but which changed the risk profile of FTX. Defendants were aware that Bankman-Fried was making false or misleading statements in order to raise money for FTX from equity investors. At times, they were in close proximity to these discussions, and directly or indirectly supported Bankman-Fried in providing false and misleading information to investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried also misrepresented the risk profile of investing in FTX throughout the Relevant Period by failing to disclose FTX’s exposure to Alameda and, relatedly, that the collateral Alameda deposited on FTX consisted largely of illiquid, FTX-affiliated tokens, including FTT, the price of which Alameda was actively manipulating. In addition to these material omissions, Bankman-Fried also made material misrepresentations to FTX investors about FTX’s risk management and its relationship with Alameda. As detailed below, Bankman-Fried made these material misstatements throughout the Relevant Period, and the entire time he was raising or attempting to raise funds for FTX—from the time FTX began operations in May 2019 through its ultimate demise in November 2022. Again, Defendants were aware that Bankman-Fried was making these false or misleading statements and that he was doing so in order to raise money from equity investors, and they directly or indirectly supported him in doing so.</p>

<li>
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Defendants Used Alameda to Carry Out the Fraudulent Scheme.</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="34">
<li>
<p>Alameda (and its many subsidiaries) served a number of essential functions in Bankman-Fried’s growing web of companies. For example, Alameda was the primary market maker on FTX at the time of FTX’s inception in 2019. In this capacity, Alameda, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, was tasked with creating liquidity on FTX to allow the platform to function more efficiently. Bankman-Fried also made venture investments through an Alameda subsidiary. Most crucially, Bankman-Fried used Alameda to house FTX customer assets and to deploy those assets, under Bankman-Fried’s direction, to help grow his empire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the inception of FTX, Defendants and Bankman-Fried diverted FTX customer funds to Alameda, and continued to do so until FTX’s collapse in November 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants and Bankman-Fried diverted FTX customer funds to Alameda in essentially two ways: (1) by directing FTX customers to deposit fiat currency (e.g., U.S. Dollars) into bank accounts controlled by Alameda; and (2) by enabling Alameda to draw down from a virtually limitless “line of credit” at FTX, which was funded by FTX customer assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result, there was no meaningful distinction between FTX customer funds and Alameda’s own funds. Bankman-Fried and Wang thus gave Alameda and Ellison carte blanche to use FTX customer assets for Alameda’s trading operations and for whatever other purposes Bankman-Fried and Ellison saw fit. In essence, Bankman-Fried and Wang placed billions of dollars of FTX customer funds into Alameda. Bankman-Fried then used Alameda as his personal piggy bank to buy luxury condominiums, support political campaigns, and make private investments, among other uses. Ellison used these funds for Alameda’s operations, including speculative trading strategies and servicing Alameda’s debt to third-party lenders. Defendants knew that none of this was disclosed to FTX equity investors or to the platform’s trading customers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist lowerroman">
<ol class="lowerroman" type="i" start="1">
<li>
<p><strong>FTX Customers Deposited Billions of Dollars into Alameda-Owned Bank Accounts, Which Alameda Spent on Its Own Trading Operations and to Expand Bankman-Fried’s Empire.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="38">
<li>
<p>From the start of FTX’s operations in or around May 2019 until at least 2021, FTX customers deposited fiat currency (e.g., U.S. Dollars) into bank accounts controlled by Alameda. Billions of dollars of FTX customer funds were so deposited into Alameda-controlled bank accounts. Ellison was aware that Alameda was receiving FTX customer funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least some of these bank accounts were not in Alameda’s name, but rather in the name of North Dimension Inc. (“North Dimension”), an Alameda subsidiary. North Dimension’s website does not disclose any connection to Alameda. Ellison knew that Bankman- Fried had directed FTX to have customers send funds to North Dimension in an effort to hide the fact that the funds were being sent to an account controlled by Alameda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda did not segregate these customer funds, but instead commingled them with its other assets, and used them indiscriminately to fund its trading operations and Bankman-Fried’s other ventures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This multi-billion-dollar liability was reflected in an internal account in the FTX database that was not tied to Alameda but was instead called “<a href="mailto:fiat@ftx.com">fiat@ftx.com</a>.” Characterizing the amount of customer funds sent to Alameda as an internal FTX account had the effect of concealing Alameda’s liability in FTX’s internal systems. Defendants knew that FTX customer funds were being sent to Alameda-controlled bank accounts and that Alameda’s liability was reflected in the “<a href="mailto:fiat@ftx.com">fiat@ftx.com</a>” account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In quarterly balance sheets that Ellison prepared, and that were provided to Alameda’s third-party lenders, Alameda tracked this liability as a “loan,” but did not specify that the “loan” was from FTX. Instead, Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, combined this liability with loans Alameda had received from third-party lenders to obscure Alameda’s intertwined financial relationship with FTX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda was not required to pay interest on the liability reflected in the “<a href="mailto:fiat@ftx.com">fiat@ftx.com</a>” account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2022, FTX began trying to separate Alameda’s portion of the liability in the “<a href="mailto:fiat@ftx.com">fiat@ftx.com</a>” account from the portion that was attributable to FTX (i.e., to separate out customer deposits sent to Alameda-controlled bank accounts from deposits sent to FTXcontrolled bank accounts). Alameda’s portion—which amounted to more than $8 billion in FTX customer assets that had been deposited into Alameda-controlled bank accounts—was initially moved to a different account in the FTX database. However, because this change caused FTX’s internal systems to automatically charge Alameda interest on the more than $8 billion liability, Bankman-Fried directed that the Alameda liability be moved to an account that would not be charged interest. This account was associated with an individual that had no apparent connection to Alameda. As a result, this change had the effect of further concealing Alameda’s liability in FTX’s internal systems.</p>
</li>

<div class="olist lowerroman">
<ol class="lowerroman" type="i" start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>The FTX Platform, By Design, Granted Special Treatment to Alameda, Including Features that Allowed Alameda to Divert FTX Customer Assets.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="45">
<li>
<p>In addition to receiving cash deposits directly from FTX customers, Alameda benefited from undisclosed features of the FTX platform, which were embedded in software code developed by Wang and other FTX engineers, and which allowed Alameda to divert FTX customer assets. For example:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Negative Balance: Alameda was able to maintain a negative balance in its customer account at FTX. Bankman-Fried directed FTX engineers, including Wang, to write software code in or around August 2019, and to update it in or around May 2020, ultimately allowing Alameda to maintain a negative balance in its account, untethered from any collateral requirements. No other customer account at FTX was permitted to maintain a negative balance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Line of Credit: On multiple occasions, Bankman-Fried directed FTX engineers, including Wang, to increase the amount by which Alameda could maintain a negative balance in its account. In effect, this gave an unofficial “line of credit” to Alameda, since Alameda was able to draw down on its FTX customer account and use those funds—which were actually the funds deposited by other FTX customers—for its own trading. At Bankman-Fried’s direction, Wang and others  continually raised the limit on Alameda’s “line of credit” to the point where it grew to tens of billions of dollars and effectively became limitless. No other FTX customer had a similar “line of credit.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liquidation Exemption: In or around May 2020, Bankman-Fried directed FTX engineers, including Wang, to exempt Alameda from the “auto-liquidation” feature of FTX’s spot margin trading services. As a result, Alameda’s collateral
could fall below the requisite margin levels without triggering the automatic liquidation of its account. Alameda was the only customer exempted from FTX’s automatic account liquidation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants were both aware that these special privileges were afforded to Alameda—and only Alameda. Defendants were also both aware that the existence of these special privileges, which were put in place at Bankman-Fried’s direction, were hidden from FTX’s investors. These privileges permitted Alameda to draw on FTX customer assets to a virtually unlimited extent for its own uses. Because its own FTX trading account was able to maintain a negative balance of billions of dollars, unbacked by sufficient collateral—as a direct result of software code implemented by Wang and others—Alameda was able to divert billions of dollars in FTX customer assets. Alameda and Ellison did just that in 2022.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist lowerroman">
<ol class="lowerroman" type="i" start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>In 2022, Alameda Diverted Billions More in FTX Customer Assets.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="47">
<li>
<p>Starting in or around 2021, Bankman-Fried directed Ellison to have Alameda borrow billions of dollars from third-party crypto asset lending firms in order to fund Bankman-Fried’s venture investments and for his personal use. Certain of these loans included provisions permitting the lenders to demand re-payment at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In or around May 2022, as prices of crypto assets were dropping precipitously, several of these lenders demanded re-payment from Alameda. Because Alameda did not have sufficient assets to cover all of these obligations, Bankman-Fried directed Ellison to draw on Alameda’s “line of credit” from FTX, which, based on the software code that Wang had previously created, allowed Alameda to borrow virtually limitless funds from FTX. Billions of dollars of FTX customer funds were thus diverted to Alameda and used by Alameda to re-pay its third-party loan obligations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because Alameda now had billions of dollars more in liability to FTX (on top of the billions of dollars reflected in the “<a href="mailto:fiat@ftx.com">fiat@ftx.com</a>” account), Bankman-Fried—concerned that this enormous liability would alarm Alameda’s lenders—directed Ellison to hide this “line of credit” in Alameda’s balance sheet. Ellison did so and presented this information to lenders, knowing that it was materially misleading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite the fact that Alameda now owed FTX billions of dollars with no immediate prospects of raising capital to pay off its “line of credit,” Bankman-Fried continued to direct Ellison to draw on the Alameda “line of credit” in the summer of 2022. The customer funds diverted to Alameda were used, among other things, to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in “loans” to Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives, as well as hundreds of millions more to fund additional venture investments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist lowerroman">
<ol class="lowerroman" type="i" start="4">
<li>
<p><strong>Bankman-Fried, with Defendants’ Knowledge and Consent, Assured Investors that FTX Customer Assets Were Secure, and Hid Alameda’s Close Relationship with FTX.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="51">
<li>
<p>Throughout the Relevant Period, Bankman-Fried was directly involved in soliciting potential investors in FTX. Bankman-Fried met, and otherwise communicated, with FTX investors, including investors based in the United States. Along with another FTX employee, Bankman-Fried was the point-person for investor relations at FTX. Defendants knew that Bankman-Fried was meeting with and soliciting funds from equity investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX’s Terms of Service, which were publicly available on FTX’s website and accessible to investors, assured FTX customers that their assets were secure, providing: “you control the Digital Assets held in your Account;” “[t]itle to your Digital Assets shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to FTX;” and “none of the digital assets in your account are the property of, or shall or may be loaned to, FTX Trading.” The Terms of Service further provided: “Once we receive fiat currency we may issue you an equivalent amount of electronic money (“E-Money”)…which represents the fiat currency that you have loaded” and “[y]ou may redeem all or part of any E-Money held in your Account at any time.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, FTX posted on its website a document entitled, “FTX’s Key Principles for Ensuring Investor Protections on Digital-Asset Platforms,” in which FTX represented that it “segregates customer assets from its own assets across our platforms.” FTX further represented in that document that it maintained “liquid assets for customer withdrawals…[to] ensure a customer without losses can redeem its assets from the platform on demand.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to making this document available to the public on its website, FTX specifically provided it to potential investors, including a U.S. investor who had invested $35 million in FTX’s Series B fundraising round in July 2021. As described above, these statements to the public, customers, and investors were false—FTX did not segregate its customer assets from its own assets, and, as events would later demonstrate, did not maintain liquidity to allow customer withdrawals on demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX investors were provided with FTX’s audited financial statements, and FTX represented in its purchase agreements that those financial statements “fairly present in all material respects the financial condition and operating results of” FTX. These audited financial statements, which do not include information about Alameda’s undocumented “line of credit” from FTX and other information discussed herein, were, at the very least, materially misleading. Indeed, FTX’s current CEO has voiced “substantial concern as to the information presented in
these audited financial statements.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the Relevant Period, Bankman-Fried made public statements assuring that customer assets were safe at FTX. For example, he stated in a tweet on or about June 27, 2022: “Backstopping customer assets should always be primary. Everything else is secondary.” He likewise tweeted on or about August 9, 2021: “As always, our users’ funds and safety comes first. We will always allow withdrawals (except in cases of suspected money laundering/theft/etc.).”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried also told investors, and directed other FTX and Alameda employees to tell investors, that Alameda received no preferential treatment from FTX. For example, Bankman-Fried told the Wall Street Journal in or around July 2022: “There are no parties that have privileged access.” Likewise, in a Bloomberg article published in or about September 2022, Bankman-Fried claimed that “Alameda is a wholly separate entity” than FTX. In the same article, Ellison is quoted as stating about Alameda: “We’re at arm’s length and don’t get any different treatment from other market makers.” Similarly, in an interview in or about August 2022, Ellison claimed that FTX and Alameda were separate companies, that Alameda received no special treatment on the FTX platform, and that there was an ethical wall between them preventing sharing of customer information between FTX and Alameda. Bankman-Fried made similar statements directly to investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants were aware of the substance of Bankman-Fried’s statements about FTX customer assets—including the security of the assets and the manner in which they would be handled—and about the relationship between Alameda and FTX. Given their involvement in the fraudulent scheme outlined herein, Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that these statements to investors were false and misleading and that they were important to FTX’s investors. Defendants further knew or were reckless in not knowing that these statements were intended to make FTX more attractive to investors and potential investors.</p>

<ol class="arabic" start="59">

<p>From its inception, FTX had poor controls and fundamentally deficient risk management procedures. Assets and liabilities of all forms were generally treated as interchangeable, and there were insufficient distinctions between the assignment of debts and credits to Alameda, FTX, and executives, including Bankman-Fried, Wang, and Singh.

<p>FTX invested significant resources to develop and promote its brand as a trustworthy company. For example, in materials provided to one investor in or around June 2022, FTX cultivated and promoted its reputation:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">FTX has an industry-leading brand, endorsed by some of the most trustworthy public figures, including Tom Brady, MLB, Gisele Bundchen, Steph Curry, and the Miami Heat, and backed by an industry-leading set of investors. FTX has the leanest brand in crypto.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX also promoted itself as a company that was willing to work collaboratively with regulators and lawmakers. In the same materials, FTX claimed: “FTX is also the only major digital asset venue to maintain positive, constructive relationships with regulators and lawmakers.”</p>

<li>
<p>Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that the reality was far different than what Bankman-Fried presented to FTX’s investors and customers.</p>

<p><strong>The FTX Automated Risk Engine</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="63">
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried repeatedly touted FTX’s automated risk mitigation protocols— which he called FTX’s “risk engine”—to the public, and prospective investors, as a safe and reliable way for crypto asset trading platforms to manage risk. FTX engineers, led by Wang, developed the software code that created the “risk engine.” In essence, the software code implemented a series of rules that were designed to reduce risk in any individual client’s account by automatically triggering certain actions (e.g., to sell collateral in an account when an account was overly extended).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried promoted the concept of “24/7” automated risk monitoring as an innovative benefit of crypto asset markets, including at a hearing on or about December 8, 2021, to the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services, where Bankman-Fried concluded his remarks by stating:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">And the last thing I will say is if you look at what precipitated some of the 2008 financial crisis, you will see a number of bilateral, bespoke, non-reported transactions happening between financial counterparties, which then got repackaged and releveraged again and again and again, such that no one knew how much risk was in that system until it all fell apart. If you compare that to what happened on FTX or other major cryptocurrencies in use today, there is complete transparency about the full open interest. There is complete transparency about the positions that are held. There is a robust, consistent risk framework applied.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to generally promoting the benefits of automated risk engines, Bankman-Fried repeatedly claimed that FTX’s own risk engine was especially sophisticated and carefully calibrated. In a submission to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, FTX touted its automated system, claiming that it calculated a customer’s margin level every 30 seconds; and that if the collateral on deposit fell below the required margin level, FTX’s automated system would sell the customer’s portfolio assets until the collateral on deposit exceeded the required margin level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These statements were materially false and misleading because of a critical omission: Bankman-Fried did not reveal that the automatic risk engine did not apply to the accounts of its most important customer—Alameda. As discussed above, Wang and other FTX engineers—as part of Defendants’ and Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent scheme—had created a special feature in the software code to exempt Alameda from the rules of the “risk engine.” This was a critical special benefit that Bankman-Fried afforded Alameda: Alameda’s collateral on deposit was allowed to fall below FTX’s required margin level without FTX liquidating any part of Alameda’s portfolio. Ellison was aware of, and took advantage of, this special undisclosed benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Bankman-Fried’s statements regarding FTX’s risk engine misled FTX’s investors by representing that its risk engine would protect FTX customer funds and would limit FTX’s exposure to any single customer, while failing to disclose that Bankman-Fried had directed Wang to ensure that the engine not apply to one of its largest customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Bankman-Fried acknowledged in a network television interview on or about December 1, 2022: “I wasn’t even trying, like, I wasn’t spending any time or effort trying to manage risk on FTX.” Bankman-Fried continued: “What happened, happened—and, if I had been spending an hour a day thinking about risk management on FTX, I don’t think that would have happened.”</p>

<p><strong>The Valuation of Alameda’s Collateral</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="69">
<li>
<p>The collateral that Alameda had on deposit, consisting largely of enormous positions in illiquid crypto assets issued by FTX and Bankman-Fried (including the “FTT” token, the “exchange token” for FTX, as described below), compounded the undisclosed risk to FTX’s investors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Alameda Overvalued Its Collateral by Ignoring Significant Liquidity Issues.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="70">
<li>
<p>Defendants and Bankman-Fried valued the FTX-affiliated tokens at trading prices, but the collateral deposited by Alameda was not worth the value assigned to it. Alameda and FTX collectively owned the majority of these tokens, and only a small portion of the FTXaffiliated tokens were in circulation. As such, the tokens were illiquid, and, as Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing, if Alameda or FTX tried to sell Alameda’s holdings, market prices for the tokens would fall, thereby driving down the value of Alameda’s deposited collateral at FTX. As a result, even if FTX had liquidated Alameda’s portfolio, the sales of those thinly traded tokens would not have generated sufficient funds to cover the amount Alameda borrowed from FTX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants and Bankman-Fried were well aware of the impact of Alameda’s positions on FTX’s risk profile. On or about October 12, 2022, for example, Bankman-Fried, in a series of tweets, analyzed the manipulation of a digital asset on an unrelated crypto platform. In explaining what occurred, Bankman-Fried distinguished between an asset’s “current price” and its “fair price,” and recognized that “large positions – especially in illiquid tokens – can have a lot of impact.” Bankman-Fried asserted that FTX’s risk engine required customers to “fully collateralize a position” when the customer’s position is “large and illiquid enough.” But Bankman-Fried knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that by not mitigating for the impact of large and illiquid tokens posted as collateral by Alameda, FTX was engaging in precisely the same conduct, and creating the same risk, that he was warning against. Defendants too knew that Alameda was drawing down on a virtually unlimited line of credit from FTX, collateralized by what they knew or were reckless in not knowing was a large illiquid position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reality of FTX’s exposure to the risk created by the valuation of Alameda’s positions stood in stark contrast to Bankman-Fried’s assertions about risk management at FTX in his October 2022 Twitter analysis, in which he described FTX’s approach and claimed that constructing the rules for FTX’s risk engine in a manner that is “conservative, and handles apparent large moves gracefully” is “probably the most important thing we do at FTX.” Bankman-Fried further claimed, contrasting FTX to the failed endeavor: “There are a bunch of other risk engine protection and sanity checks, too, which would have caught something like this.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not only did Bankman-Fried fail to tell investors that he had exempted Alameda from FTX’s risk engine, he also falsely told certain investors that FTX had no exposure to FTT at all. In late summer 2021, for example, Bankman-Fried told a potential U.S. investor in FTX’s series B fundraising round that FTX did not hold FTT and, consequently, the investor would not have any exposure to FTT. The investor ultimately invested $30 million. For the reasons
described above, Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing that at the time that Bankman-Fried made those representations, they were false and misleading.Specifically, Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing that any investment in FTX carried significant exposure to FTT, as the token was, among other things, posted as collateral for billions of dollars that FTX had loaned to Alameda to engage in speculative investments.</p>

<ol class="arabic" start="74">
<li>
<p>Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, caused Alameda to manipulate the price of
FTT by purchasing large quantities of FTT on the open market to prop up its price. This

<p><span class="underline">FTT Was Offered and Sold as an Investment Contract and, Therefore, as a Security.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="75">
<li>
<p>On or about July 29, 2019, FTX launched a crypto asset known as “FTT.” <a href="#ellison_wang_footnote_5"><strong><sup><em>(5)</em></sup></strong></a> FTX launched FTT as an “exchange token” for the FTX platform (i.e., the crypto asset or token associated with a crypto trading platform).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before launching the FTX platform in or around May 2019, FTX had minted 350 million FTT tokens in or around April 2019. Of the 350 million tokens minted, 175 million were allocated to FTX as “company tokens,” and 175 million were designated as non-company tokens. The company tokens were set to “unlock” (or become available for trading) over a threeyear period after a so-called initial exchange offering (“IEO”) of the token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the time of its offering, FTT was offered and sold as an investment contract and therefore a security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of the 175 million non-company tokens, FTX offered and sold approximately 73 million FTT in so-called “pre-sales” to investors, at prices ranging from $0.10 to $0.80. FTX raised approximately $10 million from these sales of FTT prior to the IEO. The pre-sale tokens were programmed to unlock between one to three months after the IEO. FTX did not manage separate, segregated accounts for investors, but instead pooled all proceeds from the pre-sale and the IEO of FTT and treated them interchangeably.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX used the pooled proceeds from FTT sales to fund the development, marketing, business operations, and growth of FTX, depending on the success of FTX and its management team in developing, operating, and marketing the trading platform. If demand for trading on the FTX platform increased, demand for the FTT token could increase, such that any price increase in FTT would benefit holders of FTT equally and in direct proportion to their FTT holdings. The large allocation of tokens to FTX incentivized the FTX management team to take steps to attract more users onto the trading platform and, therefore, increase demand for, and increase the trading price of, the FTT token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result of FTX and its management team’s large holdings of FTT, the interests of the company and its management team were aligned with those of investors in FTT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX’s FTT marketing materials—consisting of an FTT “whitepaper” and information posted on FTX’s website—described FTT as “the token powering the FTX ecosystem.” The publicly available information led FTT holders to reasonably expect to share in FTX’s growth and future earnings, and from appreciation in the value of FTT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FTT whitepaper specifically highlighted the profit potential of the token. For example, the whitepaper included the following statements: “We launched FTX in April and already have among the world’s most liquid orderbooks” and “[o]ur goal is to become as profitable as Bitmex and OkEx within a year.” On the FTX website, FTT purchasers were offered a 5% bonus of tokens during the first three days of the IEO if they pre-funded their FTX wallets to purchase FTT, providing a potential immediate profit to investors. FTX also represented that FTT would be listed at $1.00 on July 29, 2019, and the “pre-sales” were at prices ranging from $0.10 to $0.80, which provided purchasers an immediate profit potential based on the announced listing price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FTX whitepaper further explained: “We have carefully designed incentive schemes to increase network effects and demand for FTT, and to decrease its circulating supply.” The FTT materials stated that the token provided investors with fee rebates and discounts on FTX, and the ability to use the token as collateral for futures positions as well as for “margin trading” that FTX promised to launch “in the future.” The FTT materials referred to potential gains from FTX’s future repurchase and burning of FTT (the “buy and burn” program), to be funded by FTX’s revenues.<a href="#ellison_wang_footnote_6"><strong><sup><em>(6)</em></sup></strong></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FTX whitepaper also explained that “[c]ustomers who hold a certain amount of FTT for a period of time will receive lower FTX futures fees” and that this “will further increase demand for FTT.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTT was marketed as an investment that would appreciate in value as it grew and expanded in other ways. FTX represented that it “carefully designed incentive schemes to increase network effects and demand for FTT, and to decrease its circulating supply.” These incentives included that FTT would be listed on FTX and thus could be traded, and FTX’s “buy and burn” program would purchase FTT, thus boosting demand, and then burn those purchased tokens in order to decrease the supply of FTT and increase its price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX marketed FTT by encouraging purchasers to believe that its platform would succeed and provide a return based on that success. The FTT whitepaper emphasized “Why Invest?&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;All-Star Team,” and highlighted the importance of the management team’s experience and success in developing crypto asset trading systems. For example, the whitepaper stated that FTX’s “greatest strength lies in the team behind it” and touted FTX’s “Track Record of Proven Success” based on the background and experience of its management team. The FTT materials made clear that FTX’s core management team’s efforts would drive the growth and ultimate success of FTX. The whitepaper also advertised that certain features gave FTX an advantage over competing platforms, including industry-leading risk management systems and its liquidation engine model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX also marketed FTT as an asset that could be used in an “earn program” or in “staking programs” (i.e., a program promising interest payments on deposited assets), as additional ways in which investors could earn returns from FTT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX’s whitepaper tied the prospects of FTT’s investors to the growth of the FTX platform, and noted that FTX would undertake various “Strategies to Acquire Users and Grow Volume,” including the employment of influential spokespeople.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX’s whitepaper also stated that “[t]here are many ways FTT will be used as we add more products and features to FTX. For instance, when we launch a spot exchange in the future, FTT will be used for initial exchange offerings.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result of the above representations and the economic reality at that time, FTT investors had a reasonable expectation of profiting from FTX’s efforts to deploy investor funds to create a use for FTT and bring demand and value to their common enterprise.</p>

<p><span class="underline">Alameda and Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s Direction, Manipulated the Market Price of FTT.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="91">
<li>
<p>In July 2019, when FTX launched FTT, Alameda received a substantial portion of the 350 million FTT tokens that were minted, including all of the “company tokens” that were allocated to FTX. Alameda did not pay for these tokens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda programmed its automated trading tools (or “bots”) to conduct trades and execute transactions to purchase FTT at specific prices. On more than one occasion, Alameda and Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, actively engaged in the trading of FTT with the goal of supporting the price of the token. On these occasions, Alameda adjusted the trading parameters of its trading bots in order to support the price of FTT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, in 2019, there was downward pressure on the price of FTT as the token was being unlocked for early-stage investors. Bankman-Fried became concerned about, among other things, the psychological effect of the price of FTT dropping below a specific threshold, and instructed Ellison to have Alameda purchase FTT to support the price and avoid that outcome. In another instance in 2021, the price of FTT was again facing downward pressure from external events, this time related to substantial sales of FTT by a third party. Bankman-Fried again instructed Ellison to have Alameda purchase FTT on trading platforms to support the price. In addition, as described further below in paragraph 106, in November 2022, Ellison engaged in further deceptive conduct to support the price of FTT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By manipulating the price of FTT, Ellison and Bankman-Fried caused the valuation of Alameda’s FTT holdings to be even more inflated. As described above, Alameda’s FTT holdings were a substantial part of the collateral Alameda used to borrow funds from external lenders. By overstating the value of the collateral on Alameda’s balance sheet, Ellison and Bankman-Fried concealed Alameda’s true risk exposure from those lenders, and misled investors about FTX’s risk exposure—all in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme.</p>

<p><strong>Loans to FTX Executives and Real Estate Purchases</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="95">
<li>
<p>The FTX funds transferred to Alameda were used not only for Alameda’s proprietary trading, but also to fund loans to FTX executives, including Bankman-Fried himself, and to fund personal real estate purchases. Between March 2020 and September 2022, Bankman-Fried executed promissory notes for loans from Alameda totaling more than $1.338 billion, including two instances in which Bankman-Fried was both the borrower in his individual capacity and the lender in his capacity as CEO of Alameda. Ellison knew, or was reckless in not knowing, about these “loans.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried also used commingled funds from Alameda to make large political donations and to purchase tens of millions of dollars in Bahamian real estate for himself, his parents, and other FTX executives. Specifically, in 2020 and 2021, Wang executed promissory notes with Alameda totaling approximately $224.7 million. The funds borrowed under the promissory notes in Wang’s name were not intended for Wang’s personal use but were instead used by Bankman-Fried for other purposes, including additional venture investments. However, Wang did withdraw approximately $200,000 in funds for his own purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The loans to Bankman-Fried, Wang, and other individuals were poorly documented, and at times not documented at all. Similarly, the record keeping regarding the purchase and ownership of real estate was poorly organized and documented. Defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that neither the fact of the loans and purchases, nor the poor documentation of significant company liabilities and expenditures, was disclosed to investors.</p>

<p><span class="underline"><strong>Despite the Precarious Financial Position of FTX and Alameda, Bankman-Fried and Ellison Continued to Use FTX Customer Assets in the Summer of 2022, Including to Rescue Distressed Crypto Firms and to Further Mislead Investors.</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="98">
<li>
<p>In May 2022, the crypto markets plummeted due to a significant loss in value of certain crypto assets and networks and the collateral effects on the interrelated markets. Bankman-Fried characterized FTX, and himself, as playing an important role in stabilizing the industry. Bankman-Fried entered into a series of transactions with other members of  the industry, providing credit to and taking over other failing firms. On or about June 21, 2022, after giving a $250 million line of revolving credit to BlockFi, a global crypto financial services company, to provide the company with access to capital to ease liquidity concerns, Bankman-Fried tweeted: “We take our duty seriously to protect the digital asset ecosystem and its customers.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time that Bankman-Fried was positioning himself as a hero in the industry, however, the plummeting value of crypto assets was impacting Alameda, and as a result impacting FTX. As discussed above, as a result of the same market conditions impacting BlockFi’s liquidity, many of Alameda’s lenders demanded repayment of loans they had made to
Alameda. Ellison, at the direction of Bankman-Fried, drew down billions of dollars from its “line of credit” from FTX to repay some of Alameda’s loans—money that came from FTX’s spot market funded by FTX customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, in the summer of 2022, Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that FTX was in a precarious financial condition. However, Bankman-Fried and Ellison, with Wang’s knowledge, continued to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase and support other crypto companies, and allowed Alameda to use FTX customer funds
to repay its debts. In addition, Bankman-Fried, Wang, and other FTX executives continued to withdraw customer funds in the form of the poorly documented and undisclosed “loans” described above. Specifically, on or about July 22, 2022, Bankman-Fried loaned himself $136 million and, on or about September 28, 2022, Wang signed a promissory note to Alameda for $13.7 million, which was used by Bankman-Fried for a venture investment. Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew, or were reckless in not knowing, of the significant financial risk these “loans” posed to both Alameda and FTX. Collectively, Defendants’ and Bankman-Fried’s actions in the summer of 2022 further imperiled FTX’s financial condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that Bankman-Fried continued to present a false and misleading positive account of FTX to investors, despite FTX’s tenuous financial condition at this time. In a meeting with FTX’s U.S. investors in September 2022, for example, an FTX presentation included the claim that: “Outside of BlockFi, we didn’t increase our exposure to crypto.” This statement was false and misleading: the customer funds that FTX diverted to Alameda, including customer funds that Ellison used to repay Alameda’s lenders, were collateralized in part by Alameda’s FTT holdings. Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing that, as a result, FTX’s exposure to crypto, including its own FTT token, increased substantially as Alameda increased its borrowing, backed by FTT as collateral, in the second quarter of 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In that same meeting with FTX investors, FTX also represented that certain investments did not involve the assets of FTX or its customers. Contrary to that representation, two $100 million investments made by FTX’s affiliated investment vehicle, FTX Ventures Ltd., were funded with FTX customer funds that had been diverted to Alameda.</p>

<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="103">
<li>
<p>On or about November 2, 2022, CoinDesk, a crypto news website, published an
article stating that based on its review of an Alameda balance sheet it had obtained, Alameda
held a large position in FTT and other FTX-associated tokens. At Bankman-Fried’s direction,
Ellison responded on Twitter to reassure investors and the public that Alameda was financially
sound. Ellison did so on or about November 6, 2022, tweeting that the balance sheet referenced
in the CoinDesk article (and elsewhere by that point) “is for a subset of our corporate entities, we
have &gt; $10 billion of assets that aren’t reflected there.” Ellison continued: “…given the
tightening in the crypto credit space this year we’ve returned most of our loans by now.” The
tweet was designed to provide false reassurance to customers by implying that Alameda had
additional assets that meant its financial condition was stronger than the balance sheet suggested.
At the same time, the tweet omitted the fact that the balance sheet did not accurately reflect the
significant debt that Alameda owed to FTX. In contrast to the positive message in her tweet, at
that point, Ellison knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Alameda was insolvent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On or about November 6, 2022, the CEO of Binance, a crypto asset trading
platform, announced that “[d]ue to recent revelations that have came [sic] to light,” Binance
would liquidate its FTT holdings. Binance held FTT then valued at more than $500 million,
which it had received from FTX as part of Bankman-Fried’s buyout of Binance’s equity in FTX
as an early round investor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Binance’s announcement caused many FTX customers to withdraw their funds
from FTX. Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing that given
Alameda’s large FTT holdings, any further drop in the value of FTT threatened the solvency of
FTX, given Alameda’s multi-billion-dollar liabilities. With the knowledge and consent of the
Defendants, Bankman-Fried engaged in a frantic campaign to prevent this outcome by assuring
investors and the public that FTX was financially sound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specifically, to prevent a collapse in the market price of FTT that Binance’s sales
might cause, Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, tweeted an offer to buy Binance’s entire
stake, for $22 per token (“@cz_binance if you’re looking to minimize the market impact on your
FTT sales, Alameda will happily buy it all from you today at $22!”). When Ellison sent this
message she knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that in order for Alameda to be able to
actually purchase Binance’s FTT for $22 per token, Alameda would have to draw down
additional funds from FTX itself, further extending its line of credit, or obtain funds from thirdparty
lenders without disclosing its own tenuous financial condition. Despite this, Ellison posted
the tweet in an effort to support and increase the price of FTT, again using Alameda to impact
the price of FTT in furtherance of Defendants’ scheme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, attempting to maintain public and investor confidence in FTX,
Bankman-Fried tweeted on or about November 7, 2022: “FTX is fine. Assets are fine … FTX
has enough to cover all client holdings. We don’t invest client assets (even in treasuries). We
have been processing all withdrawals, and will continue to be ….” That tweet was false and
misleading, and Bankman-Fried later deleted it. Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew that FTX,
at Bankman-Fried’s direction, had allowed Alameda to invest “client assets” and that Alameda
had in fact done so, using FTX customer funds to make investments far riskier than “treasuries.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next day, November 8, 2022, FTX paused all customer withdrawals, and the
price of FTT plummeted by approximately 80%. Alameda’s collateral on deposit was worth far
less than the amount Alameda had borrowed from FTX. FTX was left with billions of dollars in
effectively unrecoverable loans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facing a solvency crisis, Bankman-Fried searched for investors who could
provide additional funding. On or about November 8, 2022, the CEO of Binance tweeted: “FTX
asked for our help. There is a significant liquidity crunch. To protect users, we signed a nonbinding
LOI, intending to fully acquire <a href="http://FTX.com" class="bare">http://FTX.com</a> and help cover the liquidity crunch. We
will be conducting a full DD [due diligence] in the coming days.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It only took one day, however, for Binance to decide not to acquire FTX. On or
about November 9, Binance announced: “As a result of corporate due diligence, as well as the
latest news reports regarding mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations,
we have decided that we will not pursue the potential acquisition of <a href="http://FTX.com.”" class="bare">http://FTX.com.”</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX customers withdrew approximately $5 billion from the platform that day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, Bankman-Fried sought emergency funding from other
investors, including U.S. investors, to cover a shortfall at FTX of approximately $8 billion. As
part of this effort, Bankman-Fried circulated a balance sheet to potential investors that listed a
negative $8 billion entry labeled as a “hidden, poorly internally labeled ‘fiat@ account.’” This
entry was a reference to the above-described <a href="mailto:fiat@ftx.com">fiat@ftx.com</a> account and reflected FTX customer
funds deposited in Alameda’s bank accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During a meeting with Alameda employees on or about November 9, 2022,
Ellison admitted that she, Bankman-Fried, Wang, and Singh were aware that FTX customer
funds had been used by Alameda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the morning of November 10, 2022, confronting the implosion of FTX and
Alameda, Bankman-Fried tweeted: “1) I’m sorry. That’s the biggest thing. I f*cked up, and
should have done better.”<a href="#ellison_wang_footnote_7"><strong><sup><em>(7)</em></sup></strong></a> In the same tweet thread, Bankman-Fried announced that Alameda was “winding down trading” and soon would not trade on FTX at all. Bankman-Fried
maintained that “FTX International currently has a total market value of assets/collateral higher
than client deposits (moves with prices!).” And he stated, among other things, that he was trying
to “raise liquidity,” claiming “[t]here are a number of players who we are in talks with, LOIs
[letters of intent], term sheets, etc.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next day, November 11, 2022, Bankman-Fried resigned from FTX. Shortly thereafter, FTX and approximately 100 affiliated entities, including FTX US, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Wang’s employment with FTX and Ellison’s employment with Alameda were terminated on or about November 18, 2022.</p>

<p>Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC” or “Commission”), by and through its undersigned attorneys, hereby alleges as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist upperroman text-center">
<ol class="upperroman" type="I">
<li>
<p><span class="underline"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric text-justify">
<ol class="numeric">
<li>
<p>Samuel Bankman-Fried (“Bankman-Fried”), along with Zixiao “Gary” Wang (“Wang”) and others, co-founded Alameda Research LLC (“Alameda”), a digital asset trading and investment firm, in Berkeley, California in 2017. In or around May 2019, Bankman-Fried, Wang and others launched FTX Trading Ltd. d/b/a FTX.com (“FTX Trading”) and various subsidiaries, affiliates and related entities, collectively doing business as “FTX.com” or simply “FTX,” operating a centralized digital asset exchange. In or around October 2021, Bankman-Fried appointed Caroline Ellison (“Ellison”) to serve as a co-Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Alameda, and later as sole CEO. (These parties are collectively referred to as “Defendants”). Alameda and FTX were large and well-known players in the digital asset industry, and Bankman-Fried was their young, high-profile owner and leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At its peak, the daily trading volume on FTX was over $20 billion, and it had garnered a $32 billion valuation. FTX had prominent paid sponsorships, including the naming rights to a professional sports arena in Miami, celebrity endorsements and a 2022 Super Bowl commercial that touted FTX as “the safest and easiest way to buy and sell crypto.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On November 11, 2022, Bankman-Fried’s empire abruptly collapsed. FTX customers and the world at large discovered that FTX, through its sister-company Alameda, had been surreptitiously siphoning off customer assets for its own use—and over $8 billion in customer assets were now missing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning no later than May 2019 and continuing through at least November 11, 2022 (the “Relevant Period”), Bankman-Fried owned, operated and/or controlled FTX Trading, along with its numerous subsidiaries and related entities around the world, all doing business as FTX.com or FTX. He also owned, operated and/or controlled Alameda and its various subsidiaries and related entities, as well as numerous other related entities in the digital asset industry. Throughout the Relevant Period, Alameda operated as a primary “market maker” on FTX, providing liquidity to its various digital asset markets and also performed a number of other key functions for the exchange. Bankman-Fried, along with Wang, Ellison and/or others, operated Defendant entities, together with other entities under Bankman-Fried’s majority ownership and control, as a common enterprise (referred to herein as the “FTX Enterprise”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the Relevant Period, and unbeknownst to all but a small circle of insiders, including Bankman-Fried, Ellison and Wang, FTX customers deposits, including fiat currency and digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and tether (USDT), each a commodity in interstate commerce, that were intended to be used for trading or custodied on FTX, were regularly accepted, held by and/or misappropriated by Alameda for its own use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At Bankman-Fried’s direction, FTX executives including Wang created features in the underlying code for FTX that allowed Alameda to maintain an essentially unlimited line of credit on FTX. At Bankman-Fried’s direction, FTX executives including Wang also created other exceptions to FTX’s standard processes that allowed Alameda to have an unfair advantage when transacting on the platform, such as quicker execution times and an exemption from the platform’s publicly-touted auto-liquidation risk management process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the Relevant Period, at the direction of Bankman-Fried, Ellison and others, Alameda used FTX assets, including customer assets, to trade on other digital asset exchanges and to fund a variety of high-risk digital asset industry investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives also took hundreds of millions of dollars in poorly-documented “loans” from Alameda that they used to purchase luxury real estate and property for themselves and/or family members, make political donations and for other unauthorized uses. These unauthorized uses of customer assets were not disclosed to or known by FTX customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the Relevant Period, Defendants, through a web of subsidiaries, affiliates and other related entities collectively constituting the FTX Enterprise, misappropriated customer assets for their own use and benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite this, FTX represented, in its Terms of Service and elsewhere, that customers were the “owner[s]” of all assets in their accounts, had “control” over the assets at all times, and that those assets were “appropriately safeguarded and segregated” from FTX’s own assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through this conduct and the conduct further described herein, Defendants violated Section 6(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act” or “CEA”), 7 U.S.C. § 9(1), and Commission Regulation (“Regulation”) 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. §180.1(a) (2021). Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants are likely to continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Amended Complaint and similar acts and practices, as more fully described below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accordingly, the CFTC brings this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-l, to enjoin Defendants’ unlawful acts and practices and to compel their compliance with the Act. In addition, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties and remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans, disgorgement, restitution, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court may deem necessary and appropriate.</p>

Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a), authorizes the CFTC to seek injunctive relief against any person whenever it shall appear to the CFTC that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(e), because Defendants transacted business in the Southern District of New York and engaged in acts and practices in violation of the Act and Regulations within this District.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Act is to “serve the public interests . . . through a system of effective self-regulation of trading facilities, clearing systems, market participants and market professionals under the oversight of the Commission,” as well as “to deter and prevent price manipulation or any other disruptions to market integrity; to ensure the financial integrity of all transactions subject to [the] Act and the avoidance of systemic risk; to protect all market participants from fraudulent or other abusive sales practices and misuses of customer assets; and to promote responsible innovation and fair competition among boards of trade, other markets and market participants.” Section 3 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A digital asset is anything that can be stored and transmitted electronically and has associated ownership or use rights. Digital assets include virtual currencies, such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and tether (USDT), which are digital representations of value that function as mediums of exchange, units of account and/or stores of value. Digital assets such as including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), tether (USDT) and others are “commodities” as defined under Section 1a(9) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1a(9).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In recent years, as digital asset markets have evolved, the CFTC has approved the offer of futures contracts on digital asset commodities, including bitcoin and ether futures and options, by boards of trade registered with the Commission, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (“CBOE”).</p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric text-justify">
<ol class="numeric" start="29">
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried, Wang and others co-founded Alameda in November 2017 in Berkeley, California. Initially, Alameda primarily engaged in high-frequency digital asset arbitrage trading. This practice consisted of using proprietary algorithmic quantitative computer programs, commonly known as “bots,” to identify arbitrage opportunities due to price differentials between various digital asset platforms. Alameda engaged in high-frequency arbitrage trading across a large variety of digital asset exchanges, including certain exchanges operating in the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a June 29, 2019 “white paper,” Alameda represented that within a year of its inception, it had “become the largest liquidity provider and market maker in the [digital asset] space,” trading “$600 million to 1 billion a day” and accounting for “roughly 5% of global volume in digital asset trading.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the Relevant Period, Bankman-Fried has owned 90% of Alameda and Wang owned 10%. Bankman-Fried was CEO of Alameda until October 2021, at which time he selected and appointed Ellison and another individual as co-CEOs to replace him. Ellison assumed the position of sole CEO of Alameda in August 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even after stepping down as CEO of Alameda, Bankman-Fried continued to maintain control over Alameda. For example, Bankman-Fried remained a signatory on Alameda Research’s bank accounts and an authorized trader for Alameda’s accounts with CFTC registered futures commission merchants. Bankman-Fried also maintained direct decision-making authority over all of Alameda’s major trading, investment and financial decisions. This authority was exercised at least in part through Bankman-Fried’s regular, often daily, participation in various in-person and mobile chat communications with Ellison and other senior personnel at Alameda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over time, Alameda expanded its activities into a number of new digital asset business models, including making large equity investments in various companies in the digital asset industry, including by securing large loans from digital asset lending platforms to enable it to increase the size and variety of its digital asset industry investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By late 2018, Bankman-Fried, Wang and others employed at Alameda’s offices in Berkeley, California had begun building the centralized digital asset derivatives exchange that would ultimately become FTX. Wang and developers working with Wang were primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the code underlying FTX.com (i.e. the computer programming rules that direct the function of the FTX platform). FTX development was funded, in part, by another digital asset exchange, Binance, which, upon information and belief, had acquired an approximately 20% stake in FTX in or before November 2019.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In early 2019, Bankman-Fried, Wang and others moved to Hong Kong to finalize and launch the FTX platform to the public. The FTX.com website was launched and made available to the public by no later than May 2019. Bankman-Fried was at all times during the Relevant Period the majority shareholder of FTX and related entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX offered trading in a large variety of digital assets, including digital asset commodities such as bitcoin, ether, tether and others. FTX operated primarily as a derivatives exchange and offered trading in various types of options, futures, swaps, “perpetual futures” and other digital asset commodity derivative products. FTX allowed customers to place buy (long) and sell (short) orders in an electronic order book and matched customer orders via its “trading engine” or “matching engine.” FTX also offered a number of additional services related to the trading of digital asset products. For example, FTX operated a peer-to-peer (P2P) margin lending program where customers could offer margined and leveraged offerings to one another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customers could access the FTX platform through the FTX.com website, through a mobile application and through an Application Programming Interface (API). FTX also offered an off-exchange “over the counter” (OTC) portal that enabled customers to connect and request quotes for spot digital assets and trade directly, rather than placing resting orders on a central limit order book. Wang and developers working with Wang were primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the code underlying the FTX API and OTC portal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In marketing materials and in communications with federal regulators and others, FTX touted its auto-liquidation risk management engine, cross-margin functionality and backstop liquidity provider (“BLP”) programs as unique features that limited risk. Wang and developers working with Wang were primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the code underlying these features of FTX. Alameda was a leading participant in the BLP program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX relied on Alameda resources, assets and personnel to carry out a number of core functions for the FTX platform, including creating liquid submarkets for all of the products offered on FTX, maintaining an appropriate balance of various digital assets on the exchange and supporting the “peer to peer” margin lending program. Alameda likewise relied on various FTX resources, assets and personnel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX grew quickly. By June 2019, for example, just months after its launch, according to FTX, the daily volume of futures trading on FTX often exceeded $100 million. Beginning no later than 2020, FTX was consistently ranked as one of largest digital asset exchanges in the world by trading volume. In 2021, according to FTX, FTX entities held approximately $15 billion in assets on their platforms, accounted for approximately 10% of global digital asset volumes and transacted $16 billion of volume per day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because of the perception of potential conflicts of interest between FTX and Alameda, Defendants and their employees understood that it was important to present a public perception that there was strong separation between Alameda and FTX. On information and belief, this was one key motivation for Bankman-Fried’s resignation as CEO of Alameda. Bankman-Fried, Ellison and others also reinforced a separate spheres narrative in their public statements. For example, during an August 2022 media appearance, Ellison, in her capacity as CEO of Alameda, said the following about the nature of the relationship between FTX and Alameda:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">They’re both owned by Sam [Bankman-Fried], obviously. So ultimately, sort of aligned incentives in that way. We keep them quite separate in terms of day-to-day operations. We definitely have a Chinese wall in terms of information sharing to ensure that no one in Alameda would get customer information from FTX or anything like that, or any sort of special treatment from FTX. They really take that pretty seriously.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such public representations by and on behalf of Defendants did not reflect reality. Throughout the Relevant Period, Alameda and FTX continued to share office space, first in Berkeley, California and later in Hong Kong and the Bahamas. They also shared key personnel, technology and hardware, intellectual property and other resources. Bankman-Fried, Wang, Ellison and other senior management at Alameda and FTX also had widespread access to each other’s systems and accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In January 2020, Bankman-Fried, Wang and others established a separate group of operating entities operating a digital asset exchange specifically for U.S. persons. These entities collectively did business as “FTX US” and were incorporated primarily in the State of Delaware. The FTX US entities also held various registrations, including as a licensed Money Transmitter under the laws of the State of South Dakota. FTX US offered trading to U.S. persons in a large number of digital assets, including, but not limited to, spot digital asset commodities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In October 2021, FTX US acquired a commodity derivatives company called LedgerX LLC, which then began doing business as “FTX US Derivatives.” FTX US Derivatives operated as a CFTC-registered Designated Contract Market (“DCM”), Derivatives Clearing Organization (“DCO”) and Swap Execution Facility (“SEF”). FTX US Derivatives maintained separate bank accounts and, upon information and belief, appropriately segregated and accounted for customer assets at all relevant times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the Relevant Period, FTX purported to block U.S.-based customers from using its exchange to transact in digital asset products and to instead direct those U.S. customers to transact exclusively through the FTX US and FTX US Derivatives entities. On information and belief, some U.S. persons and entities were able to use FTX to transact in digital assets, including digital asset commodity products, futures, options, swaps, “ perpetual futures” and derivatives.</p>

<p><span class="underline"><strong>FTX and Alameda Commingled, Mishandled and Misappropriated FTX Customer Assets from the Moment of FTX’s Launch</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric text-justify">
<ol class="numeric" start="46">
<li>
<p>At the time Bankman-Fried, Wang and others launched FTX, FTX did not establish the requisite bank accounts to accept and hold customer assets. Instead, customers seeking to deposit “fiat” currency (i.e. traditional government-issued currency) into their FTX accounts were directed to wire their fiat deposits to bank accounts that were owned and controlled by Alameda. Some or all of those bank accounts were opened in the name of an entity called North Dimension, a Delaware-registered wholly-owned subsidiary of Alameda that, on information and belief, deliberately did not have a name that was readily-identifiable with Alameda. Certain of these bank accounts were located and based in the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once received, FTX customer assets were not segregated from Alameda assets or placed into accounts designated as being “for the benefit of” (FBO) FTX customers. When FTX customer assets were deposited into Alameda bank accounts, Alameda personnel manually credited FTX customer accounts with the corresponding amount of fiat currency on FTX internal ledger system. Customers accessing their FTX accounts would be able to observe on the exchange’s website (and later mobile application) that their deposits had been posted to their FTX accounts, even though the fiat deposits actually remained in Alameda-controlled bank accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a small subset of customer deposits, Alameda exchanged customer deposits for fiat-backed stablecoins such as USDC and USDT (which are generally understood to be pegged 1:1 to and backed 1:1 by U.S. Dollars) and then transferred an equivalent amount of such stablecoins to FTX’s digital asset wallets. Alameda treated fiat currency and stablecoins as fungible and this was the designated method for crediting customer accounts for fiat bank deposits. While this happened occasionally, customer assets typically remained solely in bank accounts in the name of Alameda, where they continued to be commingled with Alameda’s own assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Alameda-owned bank accounts holding FTX customer fiat assets were collectively reflected on FTX’s internal ledger systems as the “fiat@ftx” account. During the Relevant Period, this account held a balance of as much as $8 billion in customer assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By approximately August 2020, FTX had opened its own FBO fiat bank accounts. However, FTX customer assets that had previously been wired to Alameda and reflected in the “fiat@ftx” group of Alameda bank accounts were not transferred to FTX’s bank accounts. Furthermore, even after August 2020, at least some FTX customers continued to send fiat deposits to Alameda-owned accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consistently from the launch of FTX and throughout the Relevant Period, Alameda accessed and used FTX customer assets for Alameda’s own operations and activities, including to fund its trading, investment and borrowing/lending activities. Alameda’s use of FTX customer assets included both customer fiat deposits that were sent to Alameda-owned bank accounts and customer digital asset deposits and holdings that Alameda accessed via the unbounded withdrawal capabilities of its FTX account.</p>

<p><span class="underline"><strong>Misrepresentations Related to the Operations of FTX and Alameda</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric text-justify">
<ol class="numeric" start="52">
<li>
<p>The use of customer assets by Alameda was not authorized by FTX customers, and FTX customers were not made aware that their assets were being used by Alameda. To the contrary, FTX’s Terms of Service expressly prohibited such use of customer assets. Specifically, Section 8.2.6 of the FTX Trading Terms of Service states:<br/>
All Digital Assets are held in your Account on the following basis:</p>
<div class="olist upperalpha">
<ol class="upperalpha" type="A">
<li>
<p>Title to your Digital Assets shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to FTX Trading. As the owner of Digital Assets in your Account, you shall bear all risk of loss of such Digital Assets. FTX Trading shall have no liability for fluctuations in the fiat currency value of Digital Assets held in your Account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>None of the Digital Assets in your Account are the property of, or shall or may be loaned to, FTX Trading; FTX Trading does not represent or treat Digital Assets in User’s Accounts as belonging to FTX Trading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You control the Digital Assets held in your Account. At any time, subject to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies (including the Terms), you may withdraw your Digital Assets by sending them to a different blockchain address controlled by you or a third party.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants were aware of the need to segregate and protect customer assets. In fact, FTX developed internal policy documents relating to the protection of customer assets. For example, in an FTX Digital Markets (“FDM”) policy document entitled “Safeguarding of Assets &amp; Digital Token Management Policy” dated August 2021, this affiliated entity of FTX Trading indicated that:<br/>
FDM has a responsibility to ensure that customer assets are appropriately safeguarded and segregated from its own funds. This includes customer assets that may be held by third party service providers. FDM will ensure that:</p>
<div class="ulist disc">
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p>Customer assets (both fiat and virtual assets) are segregated from its own assets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer assets (both fiat and virtual assets) will be clearly designated and easily identifiable;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All third-party service providers are aware that customer funds do not represent property of FDM and are therefore protected from third-party creditors; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All third-party providers are aware that customer assets are held in trust.<br/>
Regarding customer fiat assets, FDM will maintain customer accounts with a regulated credit, e-money or payment institution that is acceptable to the Securities Commission of The Bahamas (SCB). Customer accounts will be designated as such, and the monies contained therein will be appropriately ring-fenced and protected from claims against FDM.
Customer monies will be appropriately ring-fenced to protect from:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The unlikely event FDM becomes insolvent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of customer monies being used to benefit others; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FDM using customer monies to finance its own operations.<br/>
Written notice will be provided to the relevant regulated credit, e-money, or payment institution to clarify that the assets contained are held by us on trust for our customers and they are not entitled to combine the account any other account, or to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim against the money in those accounts, in respect of any debt owed by us.<br/>
All customer accounts will be under the dual signatory of two directors or of one director, together with a senior member of the management team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the Relevant Period, Bankman-Fried and other representatives of FTX consistently and repeatedly reiterated, in a variety of contexts, that customer assets were properly segregated and custodied by FTX at all times, in conformance with both FTX’s Terms of Service and generally understood best practices for derivatives exchanges, which presume a requirement for customer disclosure and consent in order to engage in rehypothecation of customer assets (i.e. re-use of deposited assets).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such statements about the treatment and custody of customer assets include misstatements that Bankman-Fried and others made and/or caused to be made to the U.S. Congress, the CFTC and/or other federal and state government agencies, investors and in public venues such as Twitter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, during February 9, 2022 testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, Bankman-Fried, while advocating for the implementation of legislation regarding digital assets and the extension of certain legal protections to digital asset exchanges, testified as follows with respect to FTX’s treatment of customer assets:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">FTX has policies and procedures for its platforms today that reflect this basic principle by maintaining liquid assets for customers withdrawals, including a sufficient balance of digital assets funded by the company for its non-U.S. platform. The resources are funded to provide sufficient cover against user losses under certain events and extreme scenarios in order to, among other purposes, ensure a customer without losses can redeem its assets from the platform on demand.<br/>
[…]<br/>
In keeping with this principle, FTX provides a user experience that enables any user to easily view account balances for all assets, for all of its platforms, in real time. By logging in to the customer’s account at FTX, the
customer can immediately view the types of assets they own held in custody by FTX. The assets are ledgered and easily identifiable to the user (but held in an omnibus wallet in the case of the customer’s tokens in order to better promote liquidity on the platform) pursuant to internal policies and procedures, and FTX regularly reconciles customers’ trading balances against cash and digital assets held by FTX. Additionally, as a general principle FTX segregates customer assets from its own assets across our platforms.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contrary to such representations and without disclosure to FTX customers, Alameda and FTX commingled assets and freely used FTX customer assets as if they were their own, including as capital to deploy in their own trading and investment activities. On information and belief, Bankman-Fried, his parents and other FTX and Alameda employees used FTX customer assets for a variety of personal expenditures, including luxury real estate purchases, private jets, documented and undocumented personal loans and personal political donations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On information and belief, commingled assets, including FTX customer assets, were also furtively used by Bankman-Fried and FTX for extensive marketing and promotional expenses in the United States, including a Super Bowl commercial and the sponsorship of a sports stadium in Miami, Florida. Many of these advertisements, including the Super Bowl commercial, touted FTX as “the safest and easiest way to buy and sell crypto.” These promotional activities were carried out in the United States to generally promote “FTX” rather than specifically “FTX US.” On information and belief, some of these promotional activities were paid for or guaranteed by FTX Trading entities.</p>

<p><span class="underline"><strong>Alameda’s Relationship with and Special Privileges on FTX</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric text-justify">
<ol class="numeric" start="59">
<li>
<p>From the launch of FTX, Alameda operated as a primary market maker on FTX. In that capacity, Alameda acted as an always-available buyer and seller of digital assets in order to provide sufficient liquidity and an available trading counterparty to FTX customers. Over time, FTX acquired additional institutional market makers, but Alameda remained a high-volume market maker throughout the Relevant Period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda also performed a number of other functions for FTX throughout the Relevant Period. For example, Alameda helped FTX maintain an acceptable balance of various digital assets and particularly stablecoins, in its wallets. To do so, Alameda was authorized to make large exchanges of various stablecoins on behalf of FTX, using FTX’s assets rather than its own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda enjoyed certain essential and undisclosed benefits and privileges on FTX throughout the Relevant Period. These advantages were programmed into the code for FTX by Wang and others at the direction of Bankman-Fried. For one, Alameda was exempt from FTX’s “auto-liquidation” risk engine functions, which would automatically liquidate (sell) a customer’s open position when their “Maintenance Margin Fraction” fell below a certain determined level. All customers who took on too much leverage or risk on FTX would thus be auto-liquidated by the exchange. Alameda was exempt from this—it could not be liquidated on FTX under any conditions. This exception was hard coded into FTX’s system. This advantage was not publicly disclosed during the Relevant Period. The existence of this and other advantages directly contradicted public statements made by and on behalf of Defendants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda’s account on FTX also had a special designation in the FTX code throughout the Relevant Period, labeled as an “allow negative flag,” which allowed Alameda to execute a transaction even if it did not have the assets available in its account to do so. This flag was implemented by an FTX executive at the direction of Bankman-Fried and with Wang’s knowledge. At Bankman-Fried’s direction, Alameda also had an essentially unbounded credit limit in the FTX database. On at least one occasion during the Relevant Period, Alameda had reached a previously-set borrowing limit for its FTX account. In response, Bankman-Fried directed Wang and/or other FTX executives to raise the borrowing limit to a level that would be unlikely to ever be exceeded. On information and belief, FTX executives ultimately raised Alameda’s borrowing limit to be many tens of billions of dollars. Alameda’s borrowed assets could also be withdrawn from FTX. These features, in combination, allowed Alameda unlimited ability to borrow and withdraw digital assets directly from FTX to put towards its off-platform activities. This functionality existed separate and apart from Alameda’s more limited participation in FTX’s P2P margin lending program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda’s ability to withdraw unlimited assets from FTX was not publicly disclosed during the Relevant Period. On information and belief, Defendants were aware of and responsible for these functionalities throughout the Relevant Period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda also enjoyed order execution timing privileges for its transactions on FTX throughout the Relevant Period. Alameda, like many other institutional customers, transacted on FTX through the API rather than the standard front-end website or mobile application. However, while most or all other customers of API had their transaction orders routed through the FTX system, Alameda was able to bypass certain portions of the system and gain faster access to the API. As a result, Alameda’s transaction orders were received several milliseconds faster than those of other API users. In the high-frequency trading sector, this is a significant time advantage. This was not publicly disclosed during the Relevant Period. On information and belief, Defendants were aware of and/or responsible for these functionalities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda also enjoyed an additional execution time privilege during the Relevant Period as a result of not being subject to certain automated verification processes, because the above features of its account made it unnecessary to carry out certain automated steps like verifying available assets before executing a transaction. Other FTX customers, in contrast, were subject to an automated review process when placing orders to ensure that they had sufficient assets in their accounts to execute the requested transaction. By avoiding this “account API lock” process, Alameda gained another significant speed advantage. Similarly, if other customers placed several orders at once, these checks occurred in sequential order, so that each transaction could be confirmed as viable. This did not apply to the Alameda account on FTX. These advantages were not publicly disclosed during the Relevant Period. On information and belief, Defendants were aware of and/or responsible for these functionalities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants were aware of and participated in facilitating the foregoing privileges afforded to Alameda, both with respect to Alameda’s advantages in its activity on FTX and with respect to Alameda’s ability to withdraw and misappropriate FTX customer assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the direction and/or under the control of Bankman-Fried and Ellison, Alameda used large amounts of capital, including capital derived from FTX customer assets, to undertake significant illiquid investments and transactions, including long-term equity holdings in a variety of digital asset companies and large acquisitions of relatively illiquid digital assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of Alameda’s most significant holdings was the FTX Token (“FTT”) digital asset. FTT was the FTX “exchange token” and could be used to obtain discounted trading fees for transactions on FTX. On information and belief, Alameda did not pay to acquire its FTT holdings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX consistently used one third of the trading revenues it collected to buy FTT tokens in the marketplace and “burn” them—a mechanism to permanently take the tokens out of circulation by sending them to a smart wallet from which they could never be withdrawn. On a weekly basis, FTX announced on Twitter the quantity of FTT it had bought and burned that week. On information and belief, this was intended to raise the value of the FTT tokens that remained in circulation, and thereby the value of the FTT that Alameda held.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda’s FTT holdings were a significant portion of its balance sheet and a significant portion of all FTT in circulation. Alameda valued its FTT holdings on its balance sheet at the market price at which FTT was traded, without applying any discount to reflect that it could not have sold its significant FTT holdings into the marketplace without causing a sharp reduction in its trading price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda also held extremely large quantities of several other illiquid digital assets relative to their circulation volumes, and likewise did not apply a discount to the value of those holdings on its balance sheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda relied on its significant holdings of FTT and similar illiquid tokens, valued at the market value of the asset without discount, as collateral to support a number of large loans from various digital asset lending platforms. During the Relevant Period, Alameda took out a large number of loans, at times totaling as much as $10 billion in notional value.</p>
</li>

<p><span class="underline"><strong>Misappropriation of Customer Assets</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric text-justify">
<ol class="numeric" start="73">
<li>
<p>By early 2022, Alameda had invested several billion dollars in directional, unhedged, illiquid and/or long-term investments. To fund these investment activities, Alameda relied on billions of dollars of loans from digital asset lending platforms, traditional bank lines of credit and its unlimited borrowing abilities on FTX, including its access to customer assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In approximately spring 2022, the digital asset markets as a whole experienced a significant downturn. This downturn came to a head in May 2022 with the crash of two significant and widely-traded digital assets, whose value crashed essentially to zero. There was significant contagion from this event, including a major decline in the value of bitcoin, ether and other digital assets. The devaluation of such central and high-volume digital assets resulted in major credit defaults throughout the digital asset industry, as the value of collateral guaranteeing various loans declined. As a result, a number of digital asset lenders and market participants made margin calls on borrowers, liquidated open positions, recalled loans and/or collapsed entirely, including into bankruptcy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In approximately May and/or June 2022, Alameda was subject to a large number of such margin calls and loan recalls. It did not have sufficient liquid assets to service its loans. Instead, at the direction and/or under the supervision of Bankman-Fried and Ellison, Alameda greatly increased its usage of FTX customer assets to meet its external debt obligations. Alameda was able to rely on its undisclosed ordinary-course access to FTX credit and customer assets to facilitate these large withdrawals, which were several billion dollars in notional value. Defendants were aware of and/or responsible for this misappropriation of FTX customer assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By approximately mid-2022, FTX’s internal ledgers reflected that the balance of Alameda’s fiat liability to FTX totaled approximately $8 billion, a staggering amount that exceeded FTX total lifetime revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publicly during this time, Defendants’ public statements falsely portrayed that FTX and Alameda remained highly profitable and liquid. Following the market crash of May 2022, Bankman-Fried, through Alameda and other entities, bailed out several digital asset companies with loans or acquisitions. Bankman-Fried portrayed these activities as benevolent and for the benefit of the digital asset industry. In connection with the acquisition of one such digital asset lending platform from a bankruptcy sale, on October 2, 2022 Bankman-Fried tweeted that “our bids are generally determined by fair market price, no discounts; goal isn’t to make money buying assets at cents on the dollar, it’s to pay $1 on the $1 and get the $1 back to customers.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On information and belief, Bankman-Fried stated privately that he was pursuing an aggressive acquisition strategy during this time at least in part to gain access to additional sources of capital that could be used to support his existing businesses and fill the hole in customer assets that had been created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried had acknowledged this large outstanding balance to a small group of key personnel of FTX and Alameda, including Ellison and Wang, throughout the Relevant Period. In one such conversation, Bankman-Fried indicated to an FTX executive that he was not concerned with Alameda’s liability on FTX.com because it was sufficiently collateralized by Alameda’s holdings of FTT tokens—the same tokens whose market price Alameda’s trading desk was actively trying to control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least in part to remediate the risk that Alameda’s large liability would be discovered, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, FTX executives reallocated Alameda’s approximately $8 billion in liabilities to a customer account on FTX’s systems that Bankman-Fried would later refer to as “our Korean friend’s account” and/or “the weird Korean account.” This was technically a sub-account of Alameda, but unlike other Alameda sub-accounts on FTX, it was not opened under an “@alameda-research.com” identifier and was not otherwise readily identifiable as being an Alameda-associated account. The system notes associated with the account described it as “FTX fiat old.” As a result, it was no longer apparent on FTX’s ledgers that Alameda had an $8 billion negative balance on its FTX account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same type of “allow negative flag” and exemption from liquidation characteristics were applied to the so-called Korean account as was applicable to the Alameda main account and other sub-accounts.</p>

<p>In or around September 2022, Bankman-Fried drafted and shared a document that questioned whether Alameda should be permanently shut down. The document, titled “We came, we saw, we researched” began: “I only started thinking about this today, and so haven’t vetted it much yet. But: I think it might be time for Alameda Research to shut down. Honestly, it was probably time to do that a year ago.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried went on to lay out a number of reasons for the suggestion to shut down Alameda, including “[t]he fact that we didn’t hedge as much as we should have alone cost more in EV [expected value] than all the money Alameda has ever made or ever will make”; “[i]n the current environment, capital is really expensive, and Alameda doesn’t justify it”; and “Alameda is making some money trading, but not enough to justify its existence[.]” These admissions were directly contrary to contemporaneous public statements that Bankman-Fried and Alameda were making regarding Alameda’s profitability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried also laid out a number of “large downsides” to shutting down Alameda, including those that reflected the interconnectedness between Alameda and FTX’s operations such as “[l]ess liquidity on FTX” and the observation that “given the amount that Alameda is doing, we can’t really shut it down.” (emphasis in original).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried also drafted a contemplated Twitter thread to announce the shutdown of Alameda, and concluded: “I feel really uncertain what’s right! So I guess my plan is that, this coming weekend, we should just make a call, and enact it before next Monday, one way or another. Thoughts?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda was not shut down at this time or at any point during the Relevant Period.</p>

<div class="olist numeric text-justify">
<ol class="numeric" start="87">
<li>
<p>On November 2, 2022, the online digital asset news publication Coindesk.com published an article titled “Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried’s Crypto Empire Blur on His Trading Titan Alameda’s Balance Sheet,” and subtitled: “Alameda had $14.6 billion of assets as of June 30, according to a private document CoinDesk reviewed. Much of it is the FTT token issued by FTX, another Bankman-Fried company.” This article reported on a purported leaked Alameda balance sheet that showed that, at least as of June 30, 2022, an extremely high portion of Alameda’s $14.6 billion in assets consisted of the FTT token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On November 6, 2022, in response to this article, the CEO of Binance tweeted that, “[d]ue to recent revelations that have came [sic.] to light,” he would be selling the remainder of his significant FTT holdings, which he had acquired during the buyout from FTX seed investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In consultation with Bankman-Fried and others, Ellison responded on Twitter that Alameda would be willing to buy back all of Binance and Zhao’s FTT holdings at $22 per token. At the direction of Bankman-Fried and Ellison, FTX personnel began liquidating Alameda’s investments and trade positions to rapidly free up capital for FTT buybacks. Nevertheless, the market value of FTT steadily declined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the evening of November 6, as they monitored and reacted to the movements in FTT prices and the contagion effects on the digital asset market more broadly, Bankman-Fried, Ellison and another Alameda executive expressed surprise that these events had not had a larger negative impact on the prices of bitcoin, saying in a chat message:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock">[Alameda executive 1]: “I&#8217;m surprised BTC isnt down more”<br/>
Ellison: “me too”<br/>
Bankman-Fried: “yea me 3”</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this time, bitcoin market prices, including on U.S. exchanges, had indeed begun to decline, likely as a direct or indirect result of the events described herein.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, an increasing number of FTX customers began requesting to withdraw their assets from the exchange. FTX personnel initially managed to keep FTX’s systems operating quickly enough to keep up with withdrawals, but soon fell behind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By late in the day on November 7, it was apparent to Defendants that FTX did not have sufficient assets to cover all customer withdrawals, and that there were not sufficient assets held in various FTX accounts to cover all customer deposit obligations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried, Ellison and other key personnel of FTX and Alameda acknowledged internally that this shortfall was not merely a matter of having sufficient liquid assets on hand to cover customer withdrawals in the short term; rather, FTX customer assets were irrevocably lost because Alameda had misappropriated them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That same day, the Alameda traders who had been liquidating Alameda’s open positions to free up capital for FTT buybacks were directed by Bankman-Fried and Ellison to instead sell everything that could be sold quickly from Alameda’s holdings, to maximize open lines of credit or any other available sources of capital, and generally do anything possible to quickly obtain billions of dollars in capital to send to FTX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried, reinforcing this instruction, confirmed a trader’s summation of the directive as “close everything down to generate capital, maximally aggressive” to “liquidate all positions.” Bankman-Fried responded that “there is definitely a fair bit of urgency” and asked for the “ETA on getting at least $2b of USD.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On or about November 7, FTX US executives asked Wang and another FTX executive to evaluate the solvency of FTX US. They were readily able to carry out this request because numerous FTX personnel, including Wang, had access to and oversight of the FTX US (but not FTX US Derivatives) code, database and ledgers in the ordinary course of their duties. Wang and/or other FTX executives ultimately identified a shortfall they did not understand and were unable to quantify on FTX US.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried quickly indicated that he would fill the hole at FTX US from liquidation of Alameda assets. On November 8, Bankman-Fried directed Alameda traders to prioritize meeting FTX US capital requirements and to send excess capital to FTX US. On information and belief, Alameda sent in excess of $185 million to FTX US to fill its shortfall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later that same day on November 8, Ellison stated in a chat message that “apparently part of what’s going on is that alameda actually has a long USDT/short USD margin position on FTX US that we aren’t tracking?” and said “which is why FTX US has less USD than we thought it should.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In direct contradiction of this internal series of events, on November 7, in public statements and various Twitter messages, Bankman-Fried and others acting on behalf of FTX continued to portray the shortfall that was causing customers to be unable to withdraw their assets as merely a liquidity problem. They affirmatively (and falsely) stated that FTX continued to be solvent and that all customer deposits were safe. For example, Bankman Fried tweeted:</p>
</li>

</div>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric text-justify">
<ol class="numeric" start="101">
<li>
<p>On information and belief, this and other tweets posted by Bankman-Fried on November 7-8, 2022 were intended to dissuade FTX customers from requesting to withdraw their assets from Defendants’ exchanges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This and other iterations of proposed tweets by Bankman-Fried were debated and rewritten among a small group of Defendants’ key employees and other of Bankman-Fried’s confidants. On information and belief, several individuals expressed concerns that Bankman-Fried’s tweet was inaccurate and/or misleading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time as Bankman-Fried was making these public assurances, he and numerous others acting on behalf of FTX were also reaching out to as many sources of funding as possible in an attempt to quickly raise several billion dollars to cover the shortfall in customer assets. As their calculation of the amount of the shortfall grew from $1-2 billion, to $2-4 billion, to as much as $8 billion, the number of viable potential rescue options diminished. Numerous parties declined to bail out FTX regardless of the favorable terms being offered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At approximately this same time, Bankman-Fried prepared or caused to be prepared a balance sheet to be shared with prospective investors showing the assets and liabilities of the companies. That balance sheet was unorthodox in a number of respects. Most notably, the balance sheet included an $8 billion negative balance from a “hidden, poorly internally labeled ‘fiat@’ account.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon information and belief, the “fiat@” account was in fact well-known to and understood by Bankman-Fried, who had previously directly managed and directed its use and characterization on the FTX systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On November 8, Bankman-Fried called the CEO of Binance to offer to sell FTX in its entirety to Binance. Binance initially accepted the offer and announced the news on Twitter, saying: “[t]his afternoon, FTX asked for our help. There is a significant liquidity crunch. To protect users, we signed a non-binding LOI [Letter of Intent], intending to fully acquire FTX and help cover the liquidity crunch. We will be conducting a full DD in the coming days.” Defendants thereafter provided Binance with various information in response to their due diligence inquiries in furtherance of the LOI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the morning of November 9 at approximately 10 AM ET, after the announcement of the then-contemplated Binance acquisition, Ellison held an “all-hands” meeting with Alameda staff. In that meeting, Ellison acknowledged that earlier that year, she, Bankman-Fried and other individuals had decided to use FTX customer assets to pay Alameda’s debts, and that Wang and another FTX executive were aware of this. Specifically, in that meeting, Ellison stated that, “starting last year” Alameda was “borrowing a bunch of money by open term loans” and used those assets to “make very illiquid investments.” Ellison further explained that following the widespread decline of digital asset prices most of Alameda’s loans had been recalled and, in order to meet those recalls, Alameda borrowed “a bunch of funds” from FTX, which in turn “led to FTX having a shortfall in user funds.” Ellison informed Alameda staff that FTX had “always allowed” Alameda to borrow customer assets, and did not require collateral for those loans. She also explained that Alameda could access user assets without requiring FTX’s approval as the “structure” allowed Alameda to “go negative in coins.” In response to an employee question, Ellison also acknowledged that her November 6 tweet to the Binance CEO offering to buy his FTT holdings at $22 per token was “kind of a misleading thing to tweet” and expressed remorse. Shortly after this meeting, most of Alameda’s staff resigned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On November 9, just one day after announcing the deal, Binance announced it would not be able to move forward with the deal to acquire FTX, saying: “[a]s a result of corporate due diligence, as well as the latest news reports regarding mishandled customer assets and alleged US agency investigations, we have decided that we will not pursue the potential acquisition of FTX.com.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the prospects of acquisition or bailout investment being unlikely, executives of Defendant entities and FTX US began advocating strongly for Bankman-Fried to move the FTX Enterprise towards bankruptcy and halt all remaining customer withdrawals from the platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On November 10, FTX and FTX US halted all trading and withdrawals, and Bankman-Fried announced that Alameda was being wound down. Bankman-Fried also posted a lengthy Twitter thread purporting to explain how he “f[<strong>*</strong>]ed up.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On November 10, at approximately 4:00 am ET, Bankman-Fried signed a document resigning his position as CEO of FTX and, as majority owner of all the FTX and Alameda companies, authorizing the appointment of an independent CEO and the filing of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next day, on November 11, 134 separate companies simultaneously filed for Bankruptcy as part of those proceedings, which are ongoing and being jointly administered in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In his initial declaration submitted shortly after the filing of the Bankruptcy petition, the FTX Enterprise’s newly-appointed CEO said the following of the situation he encountered at the FTX Enterprise:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">I have over 40 years of legal and restructuring experience. I have been the Chief Restructuring Officer or Chief Executive Officer in several of the largest corporate failures in history. I have supervised situations involving allegations of criminal activity and malfeasance (Enron). I have supervised situations involving novel financial structures (Enron and Residential Capital) and cross-border asset recovery and maximization (Nortel and Overseas Shipholding). Nearly every situation in which I have been involved has been characterized by defects of some sort in internal controls, regulatory compliance, human resources and systems integrity.<br/>
Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here. From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the days and weeks since Bankman-Fried resigned from the companies, he has continued to make widespread public statements, provide explanations and make admissions, including in live interviews. Several of his statements admit key facts pled herein. For example, in a November 15 chat message interview with a Vox publication reporter, which Bankman-Fried has confirmed he participated in, he characterized the course of relevant events as follows:
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">like, ‘oh FTX doesn’t have a bank account, I guess people can wire to Alameda’s to get money on FTX’ … 3 years later … ‘oh f*<strong>*</strong> it looks like people wired $8b to Alameda and oh god we basically forgot about the stub account that corresponded to that and so it was never delivered to FTX’</span></p>

CHIEF UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY JUDGE</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Who owns the cryptocurrency assets deposited in Earn Accounts (defined below) by Celsius’s account holders before the July 15, 2022 petition date (the “Petition Date”)? This is a gating issue at the center of many disputes in this case. As explained below, the Court concludes, based on Celsius’s unambiguous Terms of Use, and subject to any reserved defenses, that when the cryptocurrency assets (including stablecoins, discussed in detail below) were deposited in Earn Accounts, the cryptocurrency assets became Celsius’s property; and the cryptocurrency assets remaining in the Earn Accounts on the Petition Date became property of the Debtors’ bankruptcy estates (the “Estates”).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>At the Petition Date, Celsius had approximately 600,000 accounts in its Earn program (“Earn Program,” and such assets, including any proceeds thereof, the “Earn Assets” and such accounts, the “Earn Accounts”). These Earn Accounts held cryptocurrency assets with a market value of approximately $4.2 billion as of July 10, 2022. (Declaration of Alex Mashinsky, Chief Executive Officer of Celsius Network LLC, In Support of Chapter 11 Petitions and First Day Motions, “Mashinsky Declaration,” ECF Doc. 23, ¶ 49.) Included in the Earn Accounts at the Petition Date were a type of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, valued at $23 million as of September 2022. (Debtors’ Motion Seeking Entry of an Order (I) Permitting the Sale of Stablecoin in the Ordinary Course and (II) Granting Related Relief, “Original Motion,” ECF Doc. # 832, ¶ 9.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The issue of ownership of the assets in the Earn Accounts is a contract law issue. The Debtors and Committee argue that the cryptocurrency assets deposited in Earn Accounts were owned by the Debtors and are now property of the Estates. Many Earn account holders (“Account Holders”) argue that the Account Holders, rather than Celsius, own the cryptocurrency assets in the Earn Accounts and that cryptocurrency assets should promptly be returned to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Celsius adopted eight versions of the Terms of Use (collectively, the “Terms of Use” and each a version (e.g., “Terms Version 8”), which are detailed as exhibits A-1 through A-8 to the Declaration of Alexander Mashinsky, Chief Executive Officer of Celsius Network LLC, Providing Terms Dating Back to February 18, 2018 (“Terms Affidavit,” ECF Doc. # 393). For the avoidance of doubt this opinion refers to the “Terms of Use” identified in the Amended Motion as “Terms Version 8,” and Terms Version 8 (effective April 15, 2022) is the controlling document for this memorandum opinion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Debtors and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (“Committee”) contend that under unambiguous provisions in Terms Version 8, a clickwrap contract governed by New York law, Celsius held “<strong>all right and title to such Eligible Digital Assets, including ownership rights</strong>” in the cryptocurrency assets (including stablecoins) in the Earn Accounts. (See ECF Doc. # 1325 ¶ 39 (citing Terms Version 8 § 13) (emphasis added)). The Debtors’ uncontroverted evidence shows that 99.86% of the Earn Account holders accepted Terms Version 6 or a later version. (“Original Blonstein Declaration,” ECF Doc. # 1327, ¶ 20.) Earlier Terms Versions 1–5 of the Terms of Use, in effect beginning on February 1, 2018, and updated at various dates by new versions, were also clickwrap contracts accepted by the overwhelming percentage of Earn Account holders.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>If the cryptocurrency assets in the Earn Accounts are owned by the Debtors, the Account Holders are unsecured creditors and their recovery depends on the distributions to unsecured creditors under a confirmed chapter 11 plan, or under the Bankruptcy Code’s priority rules in the event of liquidation. A fundamental principle of the Bankruptcy Code is equality of distribution. There simply will not be enough value available to repay all Account Holders in full. If only some Account Holders prevail with their arguments that they own the cryptocurrency assets in their accounts, they hope to recover 100% of their claims, while most of the Account Holders are left as unsecured creditors and may recover only a small percentage of their claims.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Debtors and the Committee argue that under settled legal precedent the unambiguous language of the Terms of Use controls the ownership issue, making extrinsic evidence inadmissible, and, therefore, the cryptocurrency assets in the Earn Accounts are property of the estate. The objecting Account Holders argue that the Terms of Use are either clear that the Account Holders own the assets in the Earn Accounts, or the Terms of Use are ambiguous,preventing the Court from resolving the issue of ownership without considering extrinsic evidence. The objectors say that numerous statements by Celsius’s former Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Alex Mashinsky, and possibly other extrinsic evidence, demonstrate that the Account Holders have always owned the assets in the Earn Accounts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Debtors filed an amended motion<a href="#celsius_footnote_2"><strong><sup>(2)</sup></strong></a> that “only seeks two broadly applicable rulings: (i) that the plain language of the Terms of Use unambiguously provides that the cryptocurrency assets in the Earn Program are the property of the Debtors’ estates and (ii) that the Terms of Use are an enforceable contract (subject to certain individualized contract formation defenses). In other words, the Amended Motion seeks a presumption that each Account Holder is party to a binding contract with the Debtors, which presumption is rebuttable to the extent an Account Holder succeeds on an individual contract formation defense in the future.” (Debtors’ Reply in Support of Debtors’ Amended Motion for Entry of an Order (I) Establishing Ownership of Assets in the Debtors’ Earn Program, (II) Permitting the Sale of Stablecoin in the Ordinary Course and (III) Granting Related Relief (“Debtors’ Reply,” ECF Doc. # 1578, ¶ 3.))</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Amended Motion also seeks authority for the Debtors to sell approximately $18 million (in value) of stablecoins in the Earn Accounts, arguing that such stablecoins are property of the Estates and that a sale by the Debtors is permissible under section 363(c)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code in the ordinary course of business, or alternatively, under section 363(b)(1) other than in the ordinary course of business. The United States Trustee (“U.S. Trustee”) and multiple state securities regulators argue that a sale of stablecoins should not be approved at the present time because the Debtors have sufficient liquidity at least over the next few months. The Committee argues that the proposed sale would not be in the ordinary course of business (under section 363(c)(1)) but should be approved under section 363(b)(1) because the Debtors have shown a good business reason for the sale (to pay ongoing administrative expenses). The Court concludes it is unnecessary to resolve whether the proposed sale of stablecoins would be in the ordinary course of business because the sale should be approved outside the ordinary course of business. In the exercise of its business judgment, the Debtors have established a good business reason to permit the sale.</p>

<p><strong>The Original Motion</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>On September 15, 2022, the Debtors filed the Original Motion seeking authority to sell certain stablecoins in their possession in the ordinary course of business to fund operating expenses, including the costs of administering these chapter 11 cases. (See generally Original Motion.) The Debtors received numerous responses to the Original Motion, most of which raised concerns regarding the title and ownership status of the stablecoins the Debtors proposed to sell. The Original Motion did not explicitly seek a determination on the ownership of Earn Assets.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist upperalpha text-center">
<ol class="upperalpha" type="A" start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>The Amended Motion</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Subsequently, on November 11, 2022, the Debtors submitted the Amended Motion with a broader scope, seeking entry of an order (i) establishing ownership of assets in the Debtors’ Earn Program (as defined below) (ii) permitting the sale of stablecoins in the ordinary course and (iii) granting related relief. In support of the Amended Motion the Debtors submitted declarations of Chris Ferraro, Interim Chief Executive Officer, Chief Restructuring Officer, and Chief Financial Officer (“Ferraro Declaration,” ECF Doc. # 1326); Oren Blonstein, Head of Innovation and Chief Compliance Officer (“Original Blonstein Declaration,” ECF Doc. # 1327 and the “Supplemental Blonstein Declaration, ECF Doc. # 1584); and Robert Campagna, Managing Director of Alvarez &amp; Marsal North America, LLC, a restructuring advisory firm (“Campagna Declaration,” ECF Doc. # 1328).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Prior to the filing of the Amended Motion, on October 21, 2022, the Court entered the Final Order (I) Authorizing the Debtors to (A) Continue to Operate Their Cash Management System, (B) Honor Certain Prepetition Obligations Related Thereto, &#169; Maintain Existing Business Forms, and (D) Continue to Perform Intercompany Transactions, (II) Granting Related Superpriority Administrative Expense Status to Postpetition Intercompany Balances, and (III) Granting Related Relief (“Final Cash Management Order,” ECF Doc. # 1152). Pursuant to paragraph 5 of the Final Cash Management Order, the Debtors cannot liquidate or convert any cryptocurrency into cash absent an order of the Court. The Court observed that the Debtors’ liquidity is anticipated to tighten significantly in the new year. (See generally Campagna Declaration; Memorandum Opinion and Order Granting Motion to Approve Bidding Procedures in Connection with the Sale of Substantially All the Debtors’ Assets, ECF Doc. # 1167, at 19) (“[T]he reality is that the Debtors will have significant liquidity issues to continue operating in 2023.”).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Amended Motion garnered a significant response from individual creditors, state regulatory agencies, the U.S. Trustee, and the Committee. In total, the Court received over thirty fives responses to the Amended Motion.
The Amended Motion seeks two categories of relief. First, the Amended Motion seeks to establish the Debtors’ title and ownership rights over the cryptocurrency assets placed into the Earn Program and any proceeds thereof. If the Debtors own the Earn Assets, the Earn Assets became property of the Debtors’ bankruptcy estates (“Estates”) when the Debtors filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on the Petition Date. Second, the Amended Motion also seeks authority to sell multiple variations of a cryptocurrency called “stablecoin” in the ordinary course of business to create liquidity to fund the Debtors’ business. Each issue is discussed in turn.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric">
<ol class="numeric">
<li>
<p><span class="underline">Ownership of Earn Assets</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Debtors’ Amended Motion seeks a determination that under the Terms of Use, accepted by Celsius Account Holders when they opened their accounts (and, accepted modifications thereof), the cryptocurrency assets in the Earn Accounts presumptively are property of the estate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Debtors assert that ownership of the Earn Assets is an issue of contract interpretation and that the Terms of Use constituted a valid and enforceable contract between Celsius and its Account Holders. (Amended Motion, ¶ 3.) The Amended Motion relies on the elements of contract formation (mutual assent, consideration, and an intent to be bound by the contract) and submits that each amendment to the Terms of Use was binding on Account Holders who transferred their assets to the platform before the effectiveness of the subsequently amended Terms of Use (e.g., an Account Holder who deposited coins in July 2020 is bound by the Terms of Use version currently in effect). (See generally id. ¶¶ 18–37.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Debtors contend that the Terms Version 8 are explicit and unambiguous with respect to the ownership of Earn Assets. (Amended Motion ¶ 3.) Terms Version 8 states the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist none text-justify">
<ul class="none">
<li>
<p>In consideration for the Rewards payable to you on the Eligible Digital Assets using the Earn Service . . . and the use of our Services, <strong>you grant Celsius . . . all right and title to such Eligible Digital Assets, including ownership rights, and the right, without further notice to you, to hold such Digital Assets in Celsius’ own Virtual Wallet or elsewhere, and to pledge, re-pledge, hypothecate, rehypothecate, sell, lend, or otherwise transfer or use any amount of such Digital Assets, separately or together with other property, with all attendant rights of ownership, and for any period of time, and without retaining in Celsius’ possession and/or control a like amount of Digital Assets or any other monies or assets, and to use or invest such Digital Assets in Celsius’ full discretion.</strong> You acknowledge that with respect to Digital Assets used by Celsius pursuant to this paragraph:</p>
<div class="olist numeric text-justify">
<ol class="numeric">
<li>
<p>You will not be able to exercise rights of ownership;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Celsius may receive compensation in connection with lending or otherwise using Digital Assets in its business to which you have no claim or entitlement; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In the event that Celsius becomes bankrupt, enters liquidation or is otherwise unable to repay its obligations, any Eligible Digital Assets used in the Earn Service or as collateral under the Borrow Service may not be recoverable, and you may not have any legal remedies or rights in connection with Celsius’ obligations to you other than your rights as a creditor of Celsius under any applicable laws.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Id. (quoting Terms Version 8) (emphasis added).)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Debtors state that the above excerpt is in addition to at least four other references (express or implied) to Earn Assets (including income thereon) being the Debtors’ property. (Amended Motion ¶ 40 (citing Terms Version 8 §§ 2, 4, 10, 12).)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Moreover, the Debtors assert that, to the extent prior versions of the Terms of Use are relevant, they also support the Debtors’ position. (Id. ¶ 41.) The Debtors represent that every version of the Terms of Use has (i) allowed the Debtors to make unilateral updates to the Terms of Use and (ii) been clear that the Debtors had the right to “pledge and repledge from time to time” assets transferred to the Debtors. (Id. ¶ 43.) Celsius states that, starting with Terms Version 2, each iteration explicitly stated that the Debtors had “all attendant rights of ownership” to such assets. (Id.)</p>

<div class="olist numeric">
<ol class="numeric" start="2">
<li>
<p><span class="underline">Sale of Stablecoins</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Debtors contend that because the Earn Assets, including stablecoins, are property of the Estates, the Debtors can sell stablecoins to create liquidity to fund administrative expenses associated with these bankruptcy cases. (Id.) The Ferraro Declaration asserts that, before the Petition Date, the Debtors monetized stablecoin assets as needed to fund operations in the ordinary course of business. (Ferraro Declaration ¶ 25.) As of the filing of the Amended Motion, the Debtors or their affiliates held eleven different forms of stablecoins totaling approximately $23 million in their “Fireblocks account.” (Campagna Declaration ¶ 10.) The Amended Motion seeks Court authority to sell approximately $18 million worth of stablecoins free and clear of another party’s interests and maintains that the stablecoins are not subject to any encumbrances defined under section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code (discussed in further detail below). (Amended Motion ¶¶ 49, 54.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Debtors assert that although cryptocurrency presents a novel issue, the relief it requests—to sell assets akin to unencumbered inventory—is not. (Id. ¶ 50.) The Amended Motion submits that the sale of stablecoins is a reasonable exercise of the Debtors’ business judgment to fund the significant cost of administering the Estates while the Debtors’ income has been substantially reduced. (Id. ¶ 53.) The Debtors assert that selling stablecoins would meaningfully extend its liquidity runway. (Campagna Declaration ¶ 9.) Furthermore, the Debtors note that they have reserved sufficient stablecoins to avoid prejudice to any creditors of the Custody Program, Withhold Program, or Borrow Program whose rights are reserved pending a ruling on ownership of these assets. (Id. ¶ 10.)</p>

<p><strong>Summary of Responses</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Amended Motion garnered responses from nearly thirty creditors, fourteen states, the Committee, the U.S. Trustee, and other parties. The creditors’ responses share common features and arguments, as do the responses from states. Those filings are each discussed as a group.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric">
<ol class="numeric">
<li>
<p><span class="underline">Objection of the U.S. Trustee</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The U.S. Trustee filed a limited objection to the Amended Motion. Most significantly, the U.S. Trustee takes no position on whether the cryptocurrency assets in the Earn Accounts are property of the Estates. The U.S. Trustee’s limited objection argues only that the Court should not permit the Debtors to sell stablecoins at the present time. (“U.S. Trustee Objection,” ECF Doc. # 1489, at 2–3.) The U.S. Trustee contends that the Original and Amended Motions lack the required evidentiary basis showing that (1) the Debtors own and therefore have the authority to sell the stablecoins and, if they do, (2) what the proceeds of the sale of stablecoins will fund. (U.S. Trustee Objection at 2.)
First, the U.S. Trustee asserts, the Debtors commingled assets of their customers in such a way that it is unclear how the Debtors can accurately identify the owners of the stablecoins. (Id.) Even if the Debtors can establish ownership, the U.S. Trustee also questions how a stablecoins sale may impact the Debtors’ ability to make distributions “in kind” to customers. (Id.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, the U.S. Trustee states that the Original and Amended Motions fail to explain how the proceeds of the sale of $18 million worth of stablecoins will be used. (Id.) The U.S. Trustee submits that the sale will provide one month of additional liquidity beginning in March 2023 based on the Ferraro and Campagna declarations. (Id. at 2–3.) The U.S. Trustee contends that the Debtors must explain how this future liquidity justifies a current sale, and further claims that the Amended Motion should state that it intends to use the proceeds solely for administrative expenses, if that is indeed the case. (Id. at 3.) Finally, the U.S. Trustee asserts that the Debtors fail to explain the extent to which the proceeds of any stablecoins will be used to fund the mining business or GK8, an affiliate.

<p>The Committee filed a Limited Objection to the Amended Motion (“Committee Objection,” ECF Doc. # 1502). The Committee noted that 55% of the Debtors’ currently existing customers were already customers prior to July 22, 2022. (Id. ¶ 3.) The Committee contended that the unambiguous Terms of Use are binding on these customers considering the Debtors’ screen shots and testimony demonstrating how these customers accepted Terms Version 6. (Id.) However, the Committee asserted that the Debtors had not provided any evidence or testimony showing how the 44% of account holders who created accounts after July 22, 2021 accepted the Terms of Use, notwithstanding the Committee requests that the Debtors do so. (Id.) The Committee stated the Court cannot determine whether the Terms of Use is binding on this latter 44% of customers until the Debtors cure this evidentiary gap. (Id.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Notably, the Committee asserted that the Terms Version 8 unambiguously provides that Account Holders who elected to participate in the Earn Program transferred title to their relevant digital assets to Celsius and authorized Celsius to sell or otherwise use such digital assets in its sole discretion without further permission from the Account Holders. (Committee Objection ¶ 4.) Furthermore, each version of the Terms of Use since September 2020 contained a similar, unambiguous statement. (Id.) Therefore, the Committee argued that to the extent that the Court determines that a customer entered an enforceable contract through any version of the Terms of Use after September 2020, that customer agreed to transfer ownership of digital assets to Celsius. (Id. ¶ 5.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In evaluating the Debtors’ Terms of Use and various arguments relating to the use of the word “loan,” the Committee contended that the transfer of title and the creation of a loan are not mutually exclusive concepts. (Id.) More importantly, the Committee asserted, reading the reference to a “loan” in the Terms of Use to mean that title did not transfer would require the reader to ignore several provisions from the Terms of Use, including provisions regarding the transfer of title and Celsius’s ability to sell or otherwise transfer digital assets (including rights of ownership). (Id.) The Committee stated that it is a bedrock principle of contract interpretation that courts should not adopt an interpretation of a contract that has the effect of rendering at least one clause superfluous or meaningless, but rather, to the extent possible, should seek to read contractual provisions in harmony. (Id. ¶ 6.)
The Committee’s primary objection was to the disposal of proceeds from a sale of stablecoins for purposes other than to fund the Estates. Although the Committee argued that a sale would not be in the ordinary course of business, it believes the Debtors have established cause to sell stablecoins outside of the ordinary course of business to fund these cases provided that they are being operated for the benefit of the Estates. (Id. ¶ 7.)</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The State of Vermont filed a limited objection to the extent that the Amended Motion seeks to spend proceeds from a sale of stablecoin because (i) ownership of Earn Assets has not been determined; (ii) as demonstrated by the Examiner’s<a href="#celsius_footnote_3"><strong><sup>(3)</sup></strong></a> Interim Report (ECF Doc. # 1411), the Debtors did not segregate Earn Assets from Custody and Withhold Assets; and (iii) the Debtors should not spend funds unnecessarily while the future of these Chapter 11 proceedings remains unclear. (“Vermont Objection,” ECF Doc. # 1484, ¶ 8.) Should the Court permit the Debtors to sell stablecoins, Vermont requests that any proceeds be placed in escrow. (Id. at 3.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>As a practical matter, Vermont is concerned that the Debtors’ commingling of Earn Assets with Custody and Withhold Assets will make it difficult to determine who owns which assets. (Id. ¶ 12.) Vermont states that it does not take a position on the ownership of Earn Assets, but notes that it is not clear, based on the Terms of Use provided by the Debtors, how ownership could be conveyed from Account Holders to Celsius in a temporary fashion.

It contends that any determination on the ownership of Earn Assets is premature while the Examiner completes her investigation, and that any determination of ownership should be made with the procedural safeguards present in an adversary proceeding. (New Jersey Objection at 2.) New Jersey takes the position that the Earn Assets are owned by Celsius’s customers. (Id.) To the extent the Court permits the sale of stablecoins, New Jersey requests that the proceeds be held in escrow subject to a determination of ownership and until after the Examiner providers her final report.

<p>The Texas State Securities Board and Department of Banking (collectively, “Texas”) objects to the Amended Motion because it asserts that the Debtors’ process for the Amended Motion is expedited, premature, and should be done through an adversary proceeding with the appropriate safeguards provided by the Bankruptcy Rules. (“Texas Objection,” ECF Doc. # 1496, ¶ 1.) Texas contends that a contract may not have been formed between the Debtors and its customers because the Debtors have not offered sufficient documentation to show that Account Holders actually agreed to the Terms of Use. (Id. ¶¶ 16–17.) Should the Court find that the stablecoins are property of the Estates, Texas objects to the use of any proceeds from a sale to pay administrative costs, and instead contends that proceeds should be held for the benefit of creditors and addressed through a confirmable reorganization plan or liquidation.

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The States of Alabama, Arkansas, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and South Carolina, and the District of Columbia (collectively, the “Coordinating States”) object to the Amended Motion (“Coordinating States Objection,” ECF Doc. # 1492). The Coordinating States assert that the Terms of Use have evolved over time, and it is not clear that customers really understood the nature of these changes. (Coordinating States Objection at 3.) The Coordinating States note that the Debtors are under investigation in several states for marketing securities without necessary registrations and without complying with state regulatory frameworks and federal law, and therefore the Debtors cannot rely on the arguably unlawful Terms of Use to determine the purported ownership of these assets and what rights they have in them. (Id.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>With respect to the language in the Terms of Use, the Coordinating States note that “loan” was used ubiquitously, and that the Terms of Use states that “you grant Celsius, . . . for the duration of the period during which the Eligible Digital Assets are loaned to us through your Celsius Account, all right and title to such Digital Assets, including ownership rights.” (Id. at 4 (emphasis added in the Coordinating States Objection).) The Coordinating States contend that Account Holders would not meaningfully understand the Terms of Use to be a transfer of ownership because customers could withdraw their assets without notice or conditions whenever and in the same form as the initial deposit. (Id. at 4–5.)
Finally, the Coordinating States submit that an actual transfer of ownership would have constituted a taxable event, yet the Debtors paid no taxes on these transactions. (Id. at 4.) Washington joins in the Coordinating States Objection. (See Washington Joinder.)</p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Court received over twenty responses from creditors, some pro se and some represented by counsel, objecting to the Amended Motion (collectively, “Creditor Responses”). A common objection is that the Terms of Use are ambiguous within the four corners of the document because the Terms of Use, despite the key transfer of title and ownership clause that the Debtors rely on, ubiquitously use the terms “loan” and “lending” to describe the transaction whereby Account Holders deposit assets into Earn Accounts.<a href="#celsius_footnote_4"><strong><sup>(4)</sup></strong></a> Therefore, a layperson would understand the Terms of Use to leave title and ownership of Earn Assets to Account Holders while temporarily providing use of the assets to Celsius. (Id.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Creditors also assert that Celsius’s statements on its website, social media, and particularly the statements of former Chief Executive Officer Alexander Mashinsky in his “Ask Mashinsky Anything” videos constituted an oral modification of the contract such that, notwithstanding the written Terms of Use, the transactions between the Account Holders and Debtors did not transfer title and ownership to the Earn Assets.<a href="#celsius_footnote_5"><strong><sup>(5)</sup></strong></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Several creditors, in addition to the Coordinating States and Washington, contend that if Account Holders transferred title to their assets to Celsius then the transaction would have created a taxable event, yet Celsius did not pay taxes on these transactions or issue tax documents to Account Holders.<a href="#celsius_footnote_6"><strong><sup>(6)</sup></strong></a> As a procedural matter, several creditors believe this issue should be handled via an adversary proceeding, rather than by motion practice.<a href="#celsius_footnote_7"><strong><sup>(7)</sup></strong></a> Others submit that a decision determining Earn Asset ownership is premature at this stage of the Debtors’ bankruptcy proceedings because the Debtors’ business was a Ponzi scheme, which the Examiner’s forthcoming final report may demonstrate.<a href="#celsius_footnote_8"><strong><sup>(8)</sup></strong></a> If so, they assert that the underlying contract formed by the Terms of Use is void as a matter of public policy. <a href="#celsius_footnote_9"><strong><sup>(9)</sup></strong></a> Creditors state that a decision is also premature because the Debtors’ liquidity will not run out until March 2023.<a href="#celsius_footnote_10"><strong><sup>(10)</sup></strong></a> Finally, some creditors believe that a decision at this stage is premature because the expedited schedule to determine ownership of the Earn Assets violated the creditors’ individual due process rights. <a href="#celsius_footnote_11"><strong><sup>(11)</sup></strong></a>
The Creditor Responses contend that they have several defenses to contract formation and modification that apply to creditors as a class, which render the contract void and unenforceable, including that (i) the contract lacked consideration<a href="#celsius_footnote_12"><strong><sup>(12)</sup></strong></a>; (ii) the contract was unconscionable, because Celsius, a company with access to sophisticated legal advice, obtained title and ownership to significant assets of laypersons via a complex Terms of Use document and modifications thereto<a href="#celsius_footnote_13"><strong><sup>(13)</sup></strong></a>; (iii) Celsius failed to uphold its fiduciary duties under the contract established by the Terms of Use<a href="#celsius_footnote_14"><strong><sup>(14)</sup></strong></a>; (iv) Account Holders lacked the requisite intent to transfer ownership<a href="#celsius_footnote_15"><strong><sup>(15)</sup></strong></a>; (v) when Account Holders agreed to updated Terms of Use they may not have understood that they were agreeing to a contract and instead may have wanted to see the balance of their account(s)<a href="#celsius_footnote_16"><strong><sup>(16)</sup></strong></a>; (vi) Celsius fraudulently misrepresented its product and finances, therefore the Account Holders should not be bound by the Terms of Use<a href="#celsius_footnote_17"><strong><sup>(17)</sup></strong></a>; and (vii) Celsius operated illegally by violating the securities laws of several states.<a href="#celsius_footnote_18"><strong><sup>(18)</sup></strong></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Finally, several responses raise breach of contract claims<a href="#celsius_footnote_19"><strong><sup>(19)</sup></strong></a>, some of which raise individual contract claims regarding the creditor’s specific account circumstances.<a href="#celsius_footnote_20"><strong><sup>(20)</sup></strong></a> Additional responses assert that Celsius commingled assets, therefore, there is no factual difference between Earn, Custody, and Withhold Accounts and this Amended Motion relies on a factually inaccurate premise (i.e., that the Earn Assets are legally different from the Custody and Withhold Assets).<a href="#celsius_footnote_21"><strong><sup>(21)</sup></strong></a> At least one creditor argues that to the extent that Celsius issued withdrawals while it was insolvent, those transactions were funded by incoming deposits and were therefore fraudulent conveyances, which should be returned to the depositing Account Holder.<a href="#celsius_footnote_22"><strong><sup>(22)</sup></strong></a>
In addition to Creditor Responses, creditor Immanuel Herrmann submitted three letters signed by creditors. Four hundred fifty-two (452) creditors join the objections of creditors Eric Wohlwend and Rebecca Gallagher. (See “452 Creditor Joinder,” ECF Doc. # 1599, joining the Wohlwend Objection and Gallagher Objection.) Three hundred forty (340) creditors join the objection of Keith and Jennifer Ryals. (See “340 Creditor Joinder, ECF Doc. # 1602, joining Ryals Objection.) Three hundred ninety-seven (397) creditors signed a statement of dissatisfaction with the Committee Objection, asserting that the Committee, through its objection, abdicated its responsibility to represent creditors interests. (See “397 Creditor Statement,” ECF Doc. # 1559.) The 397 Creditor Statement also calls for the Court to add creditors to the Committee to better represent the interests of unsecured creditors.

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>On December 2, 2022 the Debtors filed the Debtors’ Reply and the Supplemental Blonstein Declaration, which substantially responded to the Committee Objection. The Debtors’ Reply maintains that a valid, enforceable contract was formed by the Terms of Use between Celsius and each Account Holder who accepted the Terms of Use (Debtors’ Reply ¶¶ 15–17), and that the Terms of Use unambiguously state that Earn Assets are the Debtors’ property and therefore became property of the Estates when the Debtors filed for bankruptcy (id. ¶¶ 18–19). Finally, the Debtors reassert that they may sell stablecoins in the ordinary course of business and, if the Court disagrees, that the Court should nonetheless approve the sale as an exercise of the Debtors’ sound business judgment. (Id. ¶¶ 21–23.)
The Debtors rebut explicit and implicit statements by creditors regarding the Debtors’ motives (see, e.g., Debtors’ Reply ¶ 5) and reject certain creditors’ arguments that the Amended Motion is procedurally improper and should be addressed in an adversary proceeding. (Id. ¶ 24.) The Debtors reiterate that they seek a declaratory judgment establishing a presumption that each Account Holder is party to a binding contract with the Debtors, which presumption is rebuttable to the extent an Account Holder succeeds on an individual contract formation defense in the future.

<p><strong>Elements of a Valid, Enforceable Contract</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Terms of Use expressly provide that they are governed by New York law. (Terms Version 8 § 33.) No one argues to the contrary. The governing legal principles do not appear to vary substantially even if the law of other states applied. In the absence of any asserted conflict in legal rules, the Court can, in any event, apply New York law as the forum state law. See Paypolitan OU v. Marchesoni, 21-CV-5397 (RA) (RWL), at *8 n.6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2022); see also Aviles v. S&amp;P Glob., Inc., 380 F. Supp. 3d 221, 307 (S.D.N.Y. 2019).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Debtors assert that the Earn Assets are property of the Estates because the Terms of Use that Account Holders accepted constituted a valid, enforceable contract which accorded title to and ownership of the Earn Assets to the Debtors. A contract requires an offer and acceptance thereof (mutual assent), consideration, and an intent to be bound. See Register.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc., 356 F.3d 393, 427 (2d Cir. 2004) (reciting the requirements for formation of a contract).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>These requirements are not different for electronic contracts, and courts have adapted traditional principles of contract formation to fit the digital era. See id. at 403 (“While new commerce on the Internet has exposed courts to many new situations, it has not fundamentally changed the principles of contract.”); see, e.g., Berkson v. Gogo LLC, 97 F. Supp. 3d 359, 384–85 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (“Most Americans now do some business over the Internet—whether making purchases or participating in a community at the pleasure of a forum host. When we do, we are almost always presented (clearly or opaquely) with contractual terms governing our use of the site. The studies conducted to date and their implications reinforce the need to reconsider principles underlying contract law, developed in an age of paper and orality.”) (internal citations omitted).</p>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric">
<ol class="numeric" start="1">
<li>
<p><span class="underline">Mutual Assent (Offer and Acceptance)</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Traditionally, mutual assent was conceptualized as the culmination of a bargaining process, with an emphasis on both parties’ intent to be bound following an active negotiation of terms. Donald P. Harris, Trips and Treaties of Adhesion Part II: Back to the Past or a Small Step Forward?, 2007 Mich. St. L. Rev. 185, 191 (“Adhesion Contracts”) (“The exemplary contract is one between parties of relatively equal bargaining power, and achieved through a negotiation process that reflects this power balance.”) (citing E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts § 4.26 (4th ed. 2004)).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Digital contracts between companies and consumers—here, Account Holders—often involve a fundamentally different process, where consumers’ participation is limited to deciding if they will participate. See Register.com, 356 F.3d at 403 (“It is standard contract doctrine that when a benefit is offered subject to stated conditions, and the offeree makes a decision to take the benefit with knowledge of the terms of the offer, the taking constitutes an acceptance of the terms, which accordingly become binding on the offeree.”); see also Adhesion Contracts at 192 (“The only alternative to complete adherence is outright rejection.”).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Given consumers’ passive role in negotiating many electronic contracts, the issue of mutual assent often turns on whether a consumer should have been aware that they were being bound by the relevant terms. See Meyer v. Uber Techs., Inc., 868 F.3d 66, 74–75 (2d Cir. 2017) (“Where there is no evidence that the offeree had actual notice of the terms of the agreement, the offeree will still be bound by the agreement if a reasonably prudent Account Holder would be on inquiry notice of the terms.”). To determine what a “reasonably prudent Account Holder” would have been aware of, courts generally evaluate the method of manifesting acceptance and the conspicuousness of the terms that were purportedly accepted. See Valelly v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc., 464 F. Supp. 3d 634, 640 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (discussing the means for manifesting acceptance); Uber Techs., 868 F.3d at 75–78 (evaluating the conspicuousness of a Terms of Service hyperlink).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>With respect to the first inquiry, courts have categorized electronic contracts based on the process for accepting their terms. The primary categories are (i) “scrollwrap” agreements, (ii) “clickwrap” agreements, and (iii) “browsewrap” agreements.<a href="#celsius_footnote_24"><sup><strong>(24)</strong></sup></a> Under this framework, the Debtors’ Terms of Use are a “clickwrap” agreement, which require an Account Holder to manifest assent by clicking a button confirming that they accept the terms or a button that implies that they have accepted the terms, but do not necessarily require the Account Holder to actually view the terms. (Original Blonstein Declaration ¶ 18.) Clickwrap contracts are routinely enforced under New York law. Whit v. Prosper Funding LLC, No. 15-00136 (GHW), 2015 WL 4254062, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. July 14, 2015) (“In New York, clickwrap agreements are valid and enforceable contracts.”) (quoting Centrifugal Force, Inc. v. Softnet Commc’n, Inc., No. 08-05463 (CM), 2011 WL 744732, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 1, 2011)).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The second, and closely related, aspect courts evaluate is how apparent it was that the contract’s terms would apply to the assenting party. The ultimate inquiry is “whether [a reasonable person] . . . would have known about the terms and the conduct that would be required to assent to them.” Uber Techs., 868 F.3d at 74–75. In making this determination, courts look to see if the terms were “reasonably conspicuous,” with an emphasis on considerations like the clutter on the page that contained the terms (or a link thereto), whether hyperlinks were in a different color or style of font, and the presence (or absence) of spatial and temporal coupling with acceptance. See, e.g., Uber Techs., 868 F.3d at 74–75 (“[T]he presentation of these terms at a place and time that the consumer will associate with the initial purchase or enrollment, or the use of, the goods or services from which the recipient benefits at least indicates to the consumer that he or she is taking such goods or employing such services subject to additional terms and conditions that may one day affect him or her.”)</p>

<li>
<p><span class="underline">Consideration</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>A contract must also be supported by “consideration.” This requirement is not exacting—each party must simply receive “something of value.” Apfel v. Prudential-Bache Secs. Inc., 616 N.E.2d 1095, 1097 (N.Y. 1993) (observing that anything with “real value in the eye of the law” can serve as consideration) (quoting Mencher v. Weiss, 114 N.E.2d 177, 181 (N.Y. 1953)).

Supp. 695, 700 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (“[T]here is no question that a contract may be modified if the contract provides for its modification.”); Ward v. TheLadders.com, Inc., 3 F.

Cadillac Ins. Co., 894 F.2d 516, 522 (2d Cir. 1990) (applying New York state law). The party seeking to enforce an alleged contract bears the burden of establishing the contract to be enforced.

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>With respect to consideration in the context of a contract modification, a service provider’s notice of a change to the terms of service and a customer’s choice to continue using the service is valid consideration.

S.D.N.Y. 2003) (“If the contract language is ‘unambiguous,’ this Court must enforce the plain, ordinary, and common meaning of those terms as a matter of law without reference to extrinsic evidence.”).

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The issues before the Court are (a) whether the Terms of Use are a contract by which complete title and ownership of Earn Assets transferred from Account Holders to Celsius when the Account Holders deposited cryptocurrency in their Earn Accounts; and (b) if so, whether the Debtors may sell stablecoins in the ordinary course of business or outside the ordinary course of business.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>For the reasons detailed below, the Court finds, on the evidence before it, that the Terms of Use formed a valid, enforceable contract between the Debtors and Account Holders, and that the Terms unambiguously transfer title and ownership of Earn Assets deposited into Earn Accounts from Accounts Holders to the Debtors. The Court also finds that stablecoins, like other Earn Assets, are property of the Estates and the Debtors may sell the stablecoins outside of the ordinary course of business to provide liquidity for these Chapter 11 proceedings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>To be clear, this finding does not mean holders of Earn Assets will get nothing from the Debtors.<a href="#celsius_footnote_26"><strong><sup>(26)</sup></strong></a> Account Holders have unsecured claims against the Debtors in dollars or in kind (depending on the terms of any confirmed plan). The amount of allowed unsecured claims is subject to later determination in this case (through the claims allowance process) and may potentially include damages asserted by Account Holders, including breach of contract, fraud or other theories of liability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Court has read every submission filed in connection with the Amended Motion and appreciates the significant time and effort that creditors, regulators and other parties in interest have undertaken on these very important issues. But based on the unambiguous contract terms, subject to any reserved defenses, the Court finds and concludes that the cryptocurrency assets deposited in Earn Accounts are presumptively property of the estate and not property of the Account Holders.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Based on the limited scope of findings sought by the Amended Motion,<a href="#celsius_footnote_27"><strong><sup>(27)</sup></strong></a> the Court’s decision does not determine the ownership of assets in the Debtors’ Custody Program, Withhold Accounts, or Borrow Program or whether any individual Account Holder has valid defenses to the contract between Account Holders and the Debtors. The Court’s findings also do not decide the rights of any state or state agencies regarding whether Celsius violated state securities laws by marketing unregistered securities.<a href="#celsius_footnote_28"><strong><sup>(28)</sup></strong></a></p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Determining ownership of the Earn Assets requires a two-step inquiry regarding (i) whether the Terms of Use formed a valid, enforceable contract between the Debtors and each Account Holder who accepted the Terms of Use, including whether subsequent versions of the Terms of Use constitute a valid, enforceable modification of a contract; and (ii) if the answer to the former questions is in the affirmative, whether the Terms of Use unambiguously transferred title and ownership of Earn Assets from Account Holders to the Debtors when Account Holders deposited their assets into the Earn Program.</p>

<li>
<p><span class="underline">The Terms of Use Formed a Valid, Enforceable Contract</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>A valid, enforceable contract requires mutual assent (i.e., one party makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer), consideration (i.e., each party exchanges a service or good), and intent to be bound (i.e., both parties intended to enter into the contract). See Register.com, Inc., 356 F.3d at 427. Accounts Holders entered a contract with the Debtors governed by the Terms of Use through a “clickwrap” agreement (see, e.g., Original Blonstein Declaration ¶ 18), which requires a user to manifest assent by clicking a button confirming that they accept the terms, or a button that implies that they have accepted the terms, but do not necessarily require the user to view the terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Exhibits to the Supplemental Blonstein Declaration provide screen captures of the sign-up process for users who signed up via the website, for all Terms of Use versions, and the mobile app for the effective period of Terms Versions 5 through 8. (Supplemental Blonstein Declaration, Exhibits A–E.) The Supplemental Blonstein Declaration explains that applicants could not advance to the next page and complete sign up unless they agreed to the Terms of Use. (Id. ¶ 6.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>New York Courts overwhelmingly accept “clickwrap” agreements as sufficient to constitute mutual assent. Uber Techs., 868 F.3d at 75 (“Courts routinely uphold clickwrap agreements for the principal reason that the Account Holder has affirmatively assented to the terms of agreement by clicking ‘I agree.’”). The Restatement (Second) of Contracts further supports the validity and enforceability of a clickwrap contract in Comment B, “Assent to known terms,” where it recognizes the common knowledge that many users never read the full terms of a clickwrap agreement before checking an “agree” box. Restatement (Second) of Contracts, § 211 cmt. b. It explains, in relevant part:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">Customers do not in fact ordinarily understand or even read the standard terms. They trust to the good faith of the party using the form and to the tacit representation that like terms are being accepted regularly by others similarly situated. But they understand that they are assenting to the terms not read or not understood, subject to such limitations as the law may impose.</span><br/>
(Id. (emphasis added).)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Here, the Original Blonstein Declaration provides testimony demonstrating that 99% of Account Holders completed this sign-up process and affirmatively assented to the contract terms contained in the Terms of Use effective at the time of sign-up. (Original Blonstein Declaration ¶ 14.)<a href="#celsius_footnote_29"><strong><sup>(29)</sup></strong></a> The Court finds that Account Holders understood that they were assenting to a contract governed by the Terms of Use even if the Account Holders chose to read some or none of the provisions. The Court empathizes with the frustrations Account Holders may feel if they did not read or understand the specific terms of the Terms of Use. Frankly, though, the rules provide needed certainty and predictability required for modern commerce in the digital era. The law in the Second Circuit is clear that clickwrap contracts such as the Terms of Use are valid and binding. The Debtors have sufficiently shown the mutual assent element of contract formation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>With respect to consideration, the Terms of Use clearly spell out the “benefit of the bargain”: “Our Earn Service allows you to earn a financing fee from Celsius, referred to as ‘Rewards,’ in the form of Digital Assets . . . in exchange for entering into open-ended loans of your Eligible Digital Assets to Celsius under the terms hereof.” (Terms Version 8 § 4.D.) The Ryals Objection argues that the Debtors’ consideration is illusory because the Terms of Use allow the Debtors to opt-out of fulfilling their end of the bargain.<a href="#celsius_footnote_30"><strong><sup>(30)</sup></strong></a> However, the Debtors put forth evidence that the Debtors’ consideration was the payment of proceeds from Earn Assets to Account Holders as “rewards.”<a href="#celsius_footnote_31"><strong><sup>(31)</sup></strong></a> The Ryals Objection concedes that the Debtors fulfilled this promise (Ryals Objection ¶ 15), and no party submits evidence that the Debtors did not do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Nor does any party provide evidence that Celsius and its Account Holders, as a class or as an individual, lacked intent to be bound by the contract terms. Certain Creditor Responses argue that the Account Holders did not intend certain effects of the contract,<a href="#celsius_footnote_32"><strong><sup>(32)</sup></strong></a> but no objection argues that all Account Holders lacked intent to enter a contract governed by the Terms of Use. Moreover, many responses to the Amended Motion attempt to hold Celsius to a different reading of the contract terms, i.e., that Account Holders retained title of Earn Assets under the Terms of Use. That certain Account Holders disagree with the Debtors’ reading of the Terms of Use is a contract interpretation issue discussed infra at III.A.3.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>For the foregoing reasons, the Debtors have convincingly argued that the three elements required to form a valid, enforceable contract were satisfied by the Account Holders’ acceptance of the Terms of Use via the clickwrap agreement.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric">
<ol class="numeric" start="2">
<li>
<p><span class="underline">Updated Terms of Use Constituted Valid, Enforceable Contract Modifications</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Modification to a contract requires the same elements—mutual assent, consideration, and intent to be bound—that are required to form an original contract. Each version of the Terms of Use allowed the Debtors’ modification of the contract terms and provided that the Account Holders’ continued use of the platform following an update constituted consent to the updated Terms of Use.<a href="#celsius_footnote_33"><strong><sup>(33)</sup></strong></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Terms of Use, beginning with Terms Version 1, provide that (i) the Debtors can unilaterally modify the Terms of Use without notice and (ii) the Account Holders’ continued use of the platform following an update constitutes consent to the amended Terms of Use. (See “Terms Affidavit Modification Provisions,” Terms Affidavit Ex. A-1 at “Changes to Terms,” Ex. A-2 § 31, Ex. A-3 § 32, Ex. A-4 § 32, Ex. A-5 § 32, Ex. A-6 § 31, Ex. A-7 § 31, and Ex. A-8 § 31.) The Terms Affidavit and Original Blonstein Declaration provide evidence that the Debtors could modify the contract and that Account Holders’ continued use of the platform constituted acceptance of the updated Terms of Use, even if the Account Holders did not affirmatively accept the updated terms. (See id.; Original Blonstein Declaration ¶ 15.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Notwithstanding the language in the Terms of Use permitting modification by the Debtors, the Debtors specifically required all Account Holders to affirmatively accept Terms Version 6, thus replacing the existing contract for any Account Holders who opened an account before Terms Version 6 became effective. (See Original Blonstein Declaration ¶ 16). The Supplemental Blonstein Declaration provides evidence showing the affirmative consent that Celsius required Account Holders to give to continue using the platform when Terms Version 6 became effective, as well as the communications distributed for the updates to Terms Versions 7 and 8. (Supplemental Blonstein Declaration ¶¶ 4–15, Ex. F, G.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Acceptance of Terms Version 6 occurred on the Debtors’ platform. (See Original Blonstein Declaration ¶ 18.) Regardless of whether an Account Holder accessed the platform from a mobile device or a computer, an in-application pop-up window appeared, stating in large letters: “We have updated our Terms.” (See Id. ¶ 18, Exhibit C.) The pop-up then noted that “[i]t’s tempting to skip reading Terms, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from continuing using our product. These are not all of the changes, please read the updated Terms in full.” (See id.) This text was followed by a few bullets highlighting key changes and a hyperlink reading “Read the full Terms,” which linked to the full Terms of Use. (Id.) Below the hyperlink, the pop-up contained three check boxes adjacent to statements, one of which was “I have read and agree to the new Terms.” (Id.) In addition, the acceptance button itself included the word “Agree.” (Id.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>This process requires an Account Holder to view a pop-up stressing the importance of reading the updated Terms of Use and required two clicks (one check box, one “Accept”). The pop-ups contained hyperlinks to read the updated Terms of Use, and Account Holders were informed of the impact of declining the updated Terms of Use. The pop-ups appear clean and compact, and contained pertinent information in close proximity with a clearly-bounded or full-screen window. Together, these characteristics meet the standard for “clear and conspicuous.” See, e.g., Uber Techs., 868 F.3d at 74–75 (“[T]he presentation of these terms at a place and time that the consumer will associate with the initial purchase or enrollment, or the use of, the goods or services from which the recipient benefits at least indicates to the consumer that he or she is taking such goods or employing such services subject to additional terms and conditions that may one day affect him or her.” (internal citations omitted)).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>If an Account Holder did not affirmatively accept the updated Terms Version 6 within two weeks, the Account Holder’s account was suspended until such time as the Account Holder affirmatively accepted the latest version of the Terms of Use. (Id. ¶ 18.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>It is not until Terms Version 8 that the Terms of Use provide for modification in writing. (Id., Ex. A-8, “Introduction.”) Therefore, as certain of the Creditor Responses correctly point out, the evidence does not support Debtors’ argument that the Terms of Use provided for modification in writing, therefore prohibiting oral modification as a matter of law. (See Amended Motion ¶ 47 “Under New York law, ‘[i]n general . . . a written agreement that expressly states it can be modified in writing cannot be modified orally.’” Towers Charter &amp; Marine Corp. v. Cadillac Ins. Co., 894 F.2d 516, 522 (2d Cir. 1990).) Nonetheless, because modifications to a contract require the same three elements as an original contract, the modifications alleged by the Creditor Responses lack evidence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Multiple Creditor Responses argue that the Debtors modified the Terms of Use through advertisements, media uploaded to Celsius’s social media channels, and the oral statements of Alex Mashinsky. (See, e.g. Gallagher Objection at 6.) As a threshold matter, this media was not submitted to the Court as evidence and the Court may consider only evidence admitted into the record. The Court provided a chance for objectors to submit evidence. None did.<a href="#celsius_footnote_34"><strong><sup>(34)</sup></strong></a> Even if this media was submitted as evidence, advertisements and other statements like those identified by certain creditors generally do not constitute offers, and an offer is a necessary predicate for any “amendment” to the Terms of Use.<a href="#celsius_footnote_35"><strong><sup>(35)</sup></strong></a> See Leonard v. Pepsico, Inc., 88 F. Supp. 2d 116, 122–24 (S.D.N.Y. 1999), aff’d, 210 F.3d 88 (2d Cir. 2000) (“The general rule is that an advertisement does not constitute an offer.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). No Creditor Response asserts that this media satisfied the three elements of contract formation or modification—these responses hew closer to contract interpretation, rather than modification, arguments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Court concludes that updates to the Terms of Use constituted valid modifications of the contract that an Account Holder entered when they created an account with Celsius.</p>

<p><span class="underline">The Terms of Use Unambiguously Transfer Ownership of Earn Assets to the Debtors</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Having established that a valid contract was formed between the Debtors and its Account Holders, the Court’s next inquiry is if the Terms of Use are unambiguous with respect to whether Account Holders retained ownership or transferred ownership of cryptocurrency assets by depositing the assets into Earn Accounts. A contract is unambiguous if “on its face [it] is reasonably susceptible of only one meaning.” Greenfield v. Philles Records, 98 N.Y.2d 562, 570 (2002). Under New York Law, contracts are interpreted and enforced in accordance with their plain meaning and their clear and unambiguous terms. In re Condado Plaza Acquisition LLC, 620 B.R. 820, 831 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2020); In re Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., 439 B.R. 811, 825 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2010) (“[T]he ultimate objective in interpreting an agreement is to determine “the intention of the parties as derived from the language employed.”) (quoting Tom Doherty Assocs. Inc. v. Saban Entm’t Inc., 869 F. Supp. 1130, 1137 (S.D.N.Y. 1994)).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Terms Version 1 does not contain any clauses regarding Celsius taking rights of ownership upon deposit of Earn Assets. (See generally Terms Affidavit, Ex. A-1.) Terms Versions 2–4 contains the following text that discusses ownership, but not transfer of title:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">In consideration for the rewards earned on your Account and the use of our Services, you grant Celsius the right, subject to applicable law, without further notice to you, to hold the Digital Assets available in your account in Celsius’ name or in another name, and to pledge, re-pledge, hypothecate, rehypothecate, sell, lend, or otherwise transfer or use any amount of such Digital Assets, separately or together with other property, with all attendant rights of ownership . . . . You acknowledge that with respect to assets used by Celsius pursuant to this paragraph.<br/>
(i) You may not be able to exercise certain rights of ownership.</span><br/>
(Terms Affidavit, Ex. A-4 § 14.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Terms Version 5 introduced the transfer of title clause that has been the subject of scrutiny in this matter. Every version of the Terms of Use beginning with Terms Version 5 includes a clause that Account Holders “grant Celsius . . . all right and title to such Digital Assets, including ownership rights” (the “Transfer of Title Clause”). (Terms Affidavit, Ex. A-5 § 14, A-6 § 13, A-7 § 13, A-8 § 13.) Account Holders who agreed to Terms of Use Version 5 or later, whether by signing up for the first time or by continuing to use the platform with an existing account, entered a contract which contained unambiguous and clear language regarding transfer of title and ownership of assets in Earn Accounts. At the hearing on this matter, Blonstein testified that 90% of Account Holders representing 99% of Earn Assets had assented to Terms Version 6 or later. (December 5, 2022 H’rg Tr. 103:3–7.) Thus, the Court finds that title to and ownership of all Earn Assets unequivocally transferred to the Debtors and became property of the Estates on the Petition Date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The crux of many objections to the Amended Motion is that Celsius’s ubiquitous use of the word “loan,” “lending,” and other variations sits in direct conflict with the singular clause transferring all title and rights of ownership to the Debtors. These responses argue that this creates an ambiguity within the four corners of the contract. But the use of the term “loan,” or variations of that term, do not contradict transfer of ownership of cryptocurrency assets to Celsius. The Account Holders argue that a layperson’s understanding of the term “loan” means the Account Holder retains ownership of their Earn Assets but temporarily allows the use of the assets by the Debtors
<a href="#celsius_footnote_36"><strong><sup>(36)</sup></strong></a> — but the Court cannot ignore the plain and clear language in the Transfer of Title Clause.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Further, even if the Court found that Account Holders loaned digital assets to Celsius, Account Holders would still be unsecured creditors. It is blackletter law that a loan of money or property to another creates a debtor-creditor relationship. In re Masterwear Corp., 229 B.R. 301, 310 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1999) (“Under New York law, a bank and its depositor stand in a debtor-creditor relationship that is contractual in nature. The bank owns the deposit, the depositor has a claim to payment against the bank, and the bank has a corresponding obligation to pay its depositor. Accordingly, a bank’s temporary freeze of an account, without more, is ‘neither a taking of possession of [the depositor’s] property nor an exercising of control over it, but merely a refusal to perform its promise.’”) (internal citations omitted). And absent a perfected security interest in tangible or intangible property, in the event of the debtor’s bankruptcy, the creditor holds only an unsecured claim. See In re Motors Liquidation Company, 430 B.R. 65, 96 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (“Indeed, by definition, an unsecured creditor has no particularized property interest in the Debtors’ estates.”); see also 4 COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY ¶ 506.03[1] (16th ed. 2022) (“As a threshold matter, a claim cannot be a “secured claim” for purposes of section 506(a) unless it is secured by a “lien” on some specific item of property in which the estate has an interest, or, alternatively, is a claim that is subject to a right of setoff.”).<br/>
&emsp; But, more importantly:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify"> By current definition, cryptocurrency is not money because it is not a medium of exchange created, authorized, or adopted by a domestic or foreign government, or by an intergovernmental organization or by agreement between two or more countries. Moreover, since cryptocurrency, NFTs and other digital assets are intangible and therefore not capable of possession, a security interest currently can be perfected only by the filing of a financing statement in the digital asset as a general intangible.</span><br/>

<p>UNDER PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE, The Quarterly Journal of INSOL International, 4TH Quarter 2022, at 16 (discussing proposed amendments to the Uniform Commercial Code, creating a new Chapter 12 to govern the transfer (whether as a sale or as a financing) of digital assets, including cryptocurrency, digital tokens and non-fungible tokens).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Thus, even if the parties’ contract purports to provide the creditor with a security interest in property, unless the security interest is perfected under applicable non-bankruptcy law, a trustee can assert strong-arm power under section 544(a) of the Bankruptcy Code to avoid the lien. 11 U.S.C. § 544(a). See also In re Castle Ventures, Ltd., 167 B.R. 758, 765 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 1994) (“However, section 544(a) of the Code, also referred to as the ‘strong arm’ clause, allows a trustee in bankruptcy to avoid liens and security interests against the debtor’s estate which were not properly perfected under state law prior to the debtor’s bankruptcy filing.”).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Here, the language in the Terms of Use transferring all ownership interest to Celsius in the cryptocurrency assets deposited in the Earn Accounts makes it very clear that no ownership interest or lien in favor of the Account Holders was intended. <a href="#celsius_footnote_37"><strong><sup>(37)</sup></strong></a> And certainly no lien in favor of the Account Holders was perfected. U.S. v. Joyeros, 410 F. Supp. 2d 121, 125 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (“General, unsecured creditors lack a particularized interest in specific assets. [A]lthough general creditors can claim an interest in their debtors’ estates, they cannot claim an interest in any particular asset that makes up that estate.” (internal citation omitted) (emphasis added)); see also In re Castle Ventures, Ltd., 167 B.R. at 765 (“If an unperfected security interest is avoided by the trustee, the secured creditor loses the lien and is reduced to the status of a general unsecured creditor.”).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>To read the Terms of Use such that “loan” overrides the unequivocal language transferring title and ownership of assets deposited into Earn Accounts to Celsius would be to read the Transfer of Title Clause out of the contract entirely. As the Committee notes, “it is a bedrock principle of contract interpretation that courts should not adopt an interpretation of a contract that has the effect of rendering at least one clause superfluous or meaningless, but rather, to the extent possible, should seek to read contractual provisions in harmony.” (Committee Objection ¶ 6.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Court can read “lend” in harmony with the Transfer of Title Clause, and the transfer of title and the creation of a loan are not mutually exclusive concepts. As an example, the Committee notes that, in the securities context, it is common for a loan of securities to a broker to also constitute a transfer of title thereto (or the incidents of ownership thereof) so that the broker can sell, lend, hypothecate, or rehypothecate the securities. (Committee Objection ¶ 6.) In that instance, title to the securities is transferred to the securities broker, and the securities broker has a contractual obligation to return equivalent securities (but not the exact same securities) to the initial transferor. (Id.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Therefore, notwithstanding the frequent use of the word “loan” in the Terms of Use and the colloquial interpretation of a “loan” as a transaction in which the entity making the loan (here, the Account Holder) retains ownership over the asset being loaned (here, the cryptocurrency), the Terms Versions 5 and later are consistent and clear: Account Holders granted Celsius “all right and title to such Eligible Digital Assets, including ownership rights.” (Terms § 13.)</p>

<p><strong>Creditors’ Rights with Respect to Defenses to Contract Formation and Breach of Contract Claims are Reserved for the Claims Resolution Process</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Many of the Creditors’ Responses consist of (i) contract interpretation arguments that rely on extrinsic evidence,<a href="#celsius_footnote_38"><sup><strong>(38)</strong></sup></a> which, as discussed supra at II.C., the Court may not consider; or (ii) individual circumstances that present colorable contract defense claims that may have merit in the claims resolution process, but do not bear on the question of title and ownership presented in the Amended Motion. Even valid contract defenses would not necessarily give rise to Account Holders claims to ownership of the cryptocurrency assets they deposited.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>A common concern raised by Creditor Responses is that statements by former Celsius CEO, Alex Mashinsky, influenced Account Holder decisions to join Celsius, keep coins on Celsius’s platform, and deposit additional assets. State responses further note that Celsius may have violated state securities laws, rendering the entire contract void for all Account Holders. These parties could have colorable defenses to contract formation as individuals and as a group.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Court takes seriously potential violations of state law and non-bankruptcy federal law, as well as the litany of allegations including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement into the contract, fraudulent conveyance, breach of contract, and that the contract was unconscionable. These allegations may (or may not) have merit, and the creditors’ rights with respect to such claims are explicitly reserved for the claims resolution process. But importantly, as a prerequisite to those claims, the Court first must establish that a contract was formed and must interpret the contract terms. In other words, a hypothetical determination that the Debtors breached the contract with an account holder or that Alex Mashinsky’s statements fraudulently induced a creditor to open an account requires a preliminary finding that there was a contract between Celsius and the Account Holders and a determination of each party’s rights and obligations under this contract. The Court makes that finding here. Specifically, the Court finds that there was a valid contract between Celsius Account Holders and Celsius and that the contract terms unambiguously transferred all right and title of digital assets to Celsius.</p>

<p><strong>Stablecoins May Be Sold as an Approved Transaction Outside of the Ordinary Course of Business</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Because the Court finds that Earn Assets are property of the Estates, it follows that stablecoins, as a type of cryptocurrency among Earn Assets, also belong to the Estates. The Debtors seek to sell stablecoins in the ordinary course of business. The “ordinary course of business” standard was intended to allow a debtor in possession the flexibility required to run its business. See In re Roth Am., Inc., 975 F.2d 949, 952 (3d Cir. 1992) (“The framework of section 363 is designed to allow a trustee (or debtor-in- possession) the flexibility to engage in ordinary transactions without unnecessary creditor and bankruptcy court oversight.”). “Ordinary course of business” is not defined within the Bankruptcy Code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In contrast, the Court may approve transactions which are not in the ordinary course of business if the debtor demonstrates a “sound business purpose” for the transaction. See 11 U.S.C. § 363(b)(1). It is unnecessary here to determine whether the sale of stablecoins will be in the ordinary course of business—particularly, now, that Celsius may not have any ordinary course of business. The Court finds that the Debtors have shown sufficient cause to permit the sale of stablecoins outside of the ordinary course of business and need not reach the question of whether the Debtors have shown that such a transaction is within the ordinary course of business.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>A rare point of agreement among all parties is that the Debtors’ liquidity is precipitously running out.<a href="#celsius_footnote_39"><sup><strong>(39)</strong></sup></a> The Debtors need to generate liquidity to fund these Chapter 11 cases and continue down the path either of a standalone plan reorganization, a section 363(b) sale, or even a liquidation plan. The Debtors project that additional liquidity will be needed in early 2023. The Debtors demonstrate a sound business justification for selling stablecoins, and the Court agrees that it is appropriate to grants authority to do so.</p>

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Earn Assets in Earn Accounts constitute property of the Estates, and that the Debtors may sell stablecoins outside of the ordinary course of business. The Court does not take lightly the consequences of this decision on ordinary individuals, many of whom deposited significant savings into the Celsius platform. As has been said repeatedly in this opinion, creditor’s rights with respect to various defense to and breach of contract claims are reserved. Creditors will have every opportunity to have a full hearing on the merits of these arguments during the claims resolution process.</p>

<p>[26] The Court notes that even if the Terms of Use indicated that coins were property of the customers, which they do not, as Debtors’ counsel pointed out at the December 5, 2022 hearing “we do not have enough coin to give everybody their coin back in kind.” (December 5, 2022 H’rg Tr. 109:21–24). Thus, even if the contract’s terms conferred title on customers, customers would still not get back 100% of their coins.

<p>[28] The Court makes no determination as to these security issues but notes that if Earn Assets are determined to be securities, it is likely that Earn Account holders would still be unsecured creditors. Section 510(b) of the Bankruptcy Code subordinates claims “arising from” the purchase or sale of a security to the claims of general unsecured creditors. 11 U.S.C. § 510(b). Thus, here to the extent that creditors argue that they have recission claims for the unlawful sale of security, these claims would likely squarely fall within the broad reach of section 510(b)’s claim “arising from” the purchase or sale of a security. 11 U.S.C. § 510(b); see In re Worldcom, Inc., 329 B.R. 10, 14 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2005) (“So long as the nature of the damage or harm complained of by a shareholder can be said to result as a consequence of his having purchased or sold share of stock or other securities of the debtor, the claimant falls within the scope of Section 510(b).”)</p>

<p><strong>Scope Of The Report.</strong>

<p><strong>Executive Summary.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The business model Celsius advertised and sold to its customers was not the business that Celsius actually operated. Through its website, marketing emails, Twitter, livestream town hall meetings, and other messaging, Celsius sold its customers on the concept that it was better than traditional “big banks.” By investing with Celsius, its customers were told that they would be able to “unbank” themselves and enjoy “financial freedom” as part of the Celsius community. Celsius emphasized that it put “its community first” and that its business would be “built on trust” and “transparency” with its community members. Celsius promoted itself as an altruistic organization, bragging in one blog post: “Can we really bring unprecedented financial freedom, economic opportunity and income equality to everyone in the world? We are Celsius. We dream big.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Celsius boasted that its primary financial product—its “Earn” program—was the “safest place for your crypto.” Customers who participated in the Earn program transferred their crypto assets to Celsius in exchange for interest, or what Celsius called rewards. In turn, Celsius deployed its customers’ crypto assets—through further loans, investments, or on exchanges—to generate income, or what Celsius called yield. Celsius’s co-founder and majority owner, Alex Mashinsky, repeatedly told customers in his weekly livestream conversations (referred to as “Ask Mashinsky Anything” or “AMAs”) that customer-deposited coins “are your coins, not our coins . . . [i]t’s always your Bitcoin.” When asked what would happen in the event of a bankruptcy, Mr. Mashinsky told customers “coins are returned to their owners even in the case of bankruptcy.”
Celsius advertised that it knew how to generate high returns with low risk by doing “what Celsius does best”—carefully vetting its financial counterparties and ensuring that when those counterparties borrowed crypto assets from Celsius, they pledged “over 100% collateral” to secure their loans. Celsius sold its customers on the promise that Celsius would pay them “at least 5% annual interest” and that their rewards would equal each customer’s share of up to 80% of Celsius’s revenues.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Another cornerstone of Celsius’s marketing strategy was its promotion of its native CEL token. Celsius told its customers that CEL was its “backbone” with Mr. Mashinsky repeatedly equating the value of CEL with Celsius’s value. Celsius explained that it intended to raise the initial capital to fund its business by selling 325 million CEL through private pre-sales and an initial coin offering (“ICO”) and that these sales would raise $50 million. Celsius told customers that they would receive rewards in CEL that Celsius would obtain from its internal treasury (which would hold an additional 325 million CEL) or by buying CEL in the secondary market. According to Celsius, this process would create a self-sustaining “flywheel.” Celsius’s marketing efforts would start the wheel spinning by generating more users and thus more assets for Celsius to invest; Celsius in turn would earn more profits and buy more CEL in the market that it would use to pay rewards, and as result of the demand spurred by Celsius’s CEL purchases, CEL’s price would increase, generating more earnings for Celsius’s customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>From its inception, however, Celsius and the driving force behind its operations, Mr. Mashinsky, did not deliver on these promises. Behind the scenes, Celsius conducted its business in a starkly different manner than how it
marketed itself to its customers in every key respect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>CEL Trading.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Celsius abandoned its promise of transparency from its start. Celsius’s first significant transaction after it was formed was to launch its ICO, a transaction that Celsius expected would raise $50 million. That did not happen. Instead, Celsius sold 203 million of the 325 million CEL offered for sale, raising $32 million. But Celsius never told its “community” that it failed to sell all of the CEL. Despite its promises of transparency, Celsius debated internally whether to tell its community how the ICO actually turned out but decided not to do so because it feared its community would be upset. Celsius also did not reveal that while Mr. Mashinsky originally pledged to purchase any unsold tokens from the ICO, he failed to close on that purchase. Those unsold tokens amounted to 117 million CEL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Celsius also hijacked its flywheel, concealing from its customers the extent to which it was making the market for CEL. Initially, in 2018 and 2019, when the crypto markets were in decline, Celsius bought CEL, as it advertised it would, to pay rewards. During this time period, the price of CEL remained well below the ICO price of $0.20.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>But starting in 2020, Celsius decided to substantially expand its purchases of CEL for the purpose of increasing CEL’s price. Instead of buying CEL when it needed to pay rewards, Celsius began timing its purchases so that they would prop up CEL’s price by creating activity in the market. Celsius also began placing “resting” orders to buy CEL, which were triggered if the price of CEL dipped below a set amount. Celsius also began selling CEL in private over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, while making offsetting purchases of CEL in public markets where it believed its purchases would impact the trading price. Internally, Celsius referred to this new strategy as its “OTC Flywheel.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Celsius’s buying spree worked to push the price of CEL higher and higher. Although the crypto markets were up in 2020 and 2021, the percentage increase in CEL’s price was significantly greater than the overall market increase, due primarily to Celsius’s purchases of CEL. Between mid-March 2020 (just as Celsius was beginning its buying spree) and June 2021, CEL’s price increased by 14,751%.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Although Celsius told customers that it would purchase CEL to pay customer rewards, it did not tell its customers the extent to which it was making the market for CEL. Instead, in one of his AMAs, Mr. Mashinsky told customers that the “over 2,000 percent increase this last year” in CEL’s price was “a great validation of the utility of [CEL] as well as the flywheel running on its own instead of us having to crank it up once in a while.” But internally, Celsius’s Head of Trading Desk recognized that Celsius was in fact cranking up the flywheel. He wrote to other employees, including Celsius’s then-Chief Financial Officer: “Just to clarify between us three: The last 3-4 months we bought always more CEL than what we pay as interest per week but we did not buy it for the interest payments, that is just what we told the community.” After a round of CEL purchases in September 2020, the same Celsius employees congratulated themselves on “our good work” resulting in “people thinking [the price of CEL] is going to the moon haha.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The increasing price of CEL had three significant consequences for Celsius and its insiders. First, it significantly inflated Celsius’s balance sheet. Celsius accounted for CEL in two buckets: (i) Treasury CEL consisting of the CEL Celsius minted at the time of the ICO but did not offer for sale; and (ii) Non-Treasury CEL consisting of the CEL that Celsius bought on the market for itself and its customers. In February 2019, Celsius added its Treasury CEL to its balance sheet at then-market prices resulting in an increase in reported assets of $6.6 million. By December 30, 2021, Celsius reported that the market value of its Treasury CEL was $1.5 billion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The following chart illustrates how the increasing market price for CEL improved Celsius’s balance sheet and what happened as Celsius could no longer afford to prop up CEL’s price in the run-up to its bankruptcy filing.</p>

<p>Note: This chart summarizes the non-Treasury CEL values (excluding CEL held to meet customer obligations) reflected on Celsius’s books and records from the second quarter of 2021 until the second quarter of 2022.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Despite the values reflected on its balance sheet, CEL had limited utility, including because there was no market to deploy CEL outside of Celsius’s platform. In 2022, Celsius employees routinely discussed that CEL was “worthless,” stating that its price “should be 0,” and that Celsius should “assume CEL is $0 since we cannot liquidate our current CEL position,” and questioning whether any party (other than Celsius itself) was purchasing CEL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Second, the increasing price of CEL benefited Celsius’s insiders who held most of the CEL following the ICO and then made millions of dollars selling a substantial portion of their CEL tokens. Between 2018 and the Petition Date, Mr. Mashinsky sold at least 25 million CEL tokens, realizing at least $68.7 million on these sales. S. Daniel Leon, also a founder of Celsius, sold at least 2.6 million CEL tokens for at least $9.74 million.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>During the height of Celsius’s market making, Celsius often sought to protect CEL from price drops that it attributed to Mr. Mashinsky’s sales of large amounts of his personal CEL holdings. As a result of Mr. Mashinsky’s sales, Celsius often increased the size of its resting orders to buy all of the CEL that Mr. Mashinsky and his other companies were selling. These trades caused Celsius’s former Chief Financial Officer to write “[w]e are talking about becoming a regulated entity and we are doing something possibly illegal and definitely not compliant.” As one employee noted in an internal Slack communication: “if anyone ever found out our position and how much our founders took in USD could be a very very bad look . . . We are using users USDC to pay for employees worthless CEL . . . All because the company is the one inflating the price to get the valuations to be able to sell back to the company.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Finally, Celsius did not earn sufficient yield on its crypto asset deployments to fully fund its CEL buybacks. As a result, it began using customer-deposited Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to fund its CEL purchases. But because Celsius lacked adequate reporting systems to track and reconcile customer assets on a coin-by-coin basis, Celsius was unable to track when it was short the necessary coins to meet customer obligations. Celsius was therefore caught off guard in early 2021 when it discovered a shortfall in BTC and ETH (which it had been using to fund CEL buybacks). Because the prices of BTC and ETH were increasing at that time, the amount of dollars it cost Celsius to acquire the necessary number of BTC and ETH also increased. Celsius scrambled to correct the shortfall by using stablecoins to buy or borrow the number of BTC and ETH it needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Correcting the shortfall in BTC and ETH cost Celsius approximately $300 million, which it paid in stablecoins. Celsius used customer deposits to acquire those stablecoins. As a result, Celsius was left with a hole in its balance sheet of stablecoins rather than BTC and ETH. That hole continued to grow as a result of Celsius’s continued buybacks of CEL and the significant losses Celsius suffered on some of its deployments in 2021. Celsius’s stablecoin deficit between May 28, 2021 and Celsius’s bankruptcy filing is depicted in the below chart and amounted to a billion-dollar hole in Celsius’s assets. As the chart also demonstrates, as customers began withdrawing BTC and ETH from Celsius in May and June 2022, Celsius had to unwind its borrowings to recover the BTC and ETH it had pledged. As a result, its stablecoin eficit was replaced with a deficit in BTC and ETH.</p>

<p><strong>NET COIN SURPLUS/(DEFICIT) MAY 2021 TO PETITION DATE</strong></p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Note: This chart reflects the net surplus or deficit in all coins (total AUM) categorized by coin type, from May 2021 through the Petition Date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Celsius recognized that it should not use customer assets to purchase the coins necessary to cover liabilities to other customers. But it justified its use of customer deposits to fill this hole in its balance sheet on the basis that it was not selling customer deposits but instead posting them as collateral to borrow the necessary coins. Celsius also used the proceeds of these borrowings to continue to purchase CEL. In April 2022, Celsius’s Coin Deployment Specialist described Celsius’s practice of “using customer stable coins” and “growing short in customer coins” to buy CEL as “very ponzi like.” A few weeks later when Celsius made another push to prop up the price of CEL, Celsius’s former Vice President of Treasury asked where the cash was coming from to make the CEL purchases and Celsius’s Coin Deployment Specialist replied, “users like always.” This same employee explained that at the time he made this statement, Celsius had “negative equity” and therefore necessarily was using customer funds when it made these purchases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In addition to using customer deposits, Celsius also turned to the funds it was raising from outside investors to buy CEL. Internally, Celsius’s managers expressed concern that Celsius was using “equity money [to buy CEL] that should be strategically used to grow the company.” When the Examiner asked Celsius’s former Vice President of Treasury why Celsius bought CEL to pay rewards rather than using the CEL it held in Treasury, he acknowledged that the answer lies in who holds the most CEL. Another manager put it more bluntly: “we spent all our cash paying execs and trying to prop up alexs [sic] net worth in CEL token.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In total, Celsius spent at least $558 million buying its own token on the market. From 2018 through the Petition Date, Celsius transferred at least 223 million CEL from the secondary market to its own wallets, a greater number than the total amount of CEL (203 million) released to the public in the ICO. In effect, Celsius bought every CEL token in the market at least one time and in some instances, twice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>But once Celsius acquired this CEL, it had no ability to deploy its CEL outside of its own platform. In fact, Celsius never liquidated any of its CEL to address its liquidity needs, even as it scrambled to find liquid assets in the run up to June 12, 2022, the date on which it paused all customer withdrawals. Today, Celsius holds essentially the same amount of CEL as it did on January 1, 2022 (an amount which constitutes approximately 95% of all CEL in existence).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Reward Rates.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>What Celsius told its customers about its reward rates also did not match what Celsius actually did. Celsius did not distribute up to 80% of its revenues to its customers because it had little to no profits to distribute. Celsius also made no effort to set its reward rates based on its yield. When regulators asked Celsius how it set its reward rates, Celsius explained that there was no correlation between the interest rates it paid to customers and the yield it generated from investing customer assets. Despite leading customers to believe that it had a defined reward rate setting policy that allowed it to distribute up to 80% of its revenues to customers, Celsius had no reward policy until July 2021. And the policy it adopted at that time did not correlate reward rates to yield.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Importantly, if Celsius had set its reward rates based on its revenues or profits, those rates would have been substantially lower than what Celsius paid. Instead, Celsius consistently set its reward rates based on what it perceived was necessary to beat the competition and not based upon the yield it was earning from investing customer assets. While this strategy of offering high rates suggested to customers that Celsius was generating the high yield on investments that it advertised, the reality was that for most of Celsius’s existence, the rewards it paid exceeded by substantial amounts the revenues Celsius could earn.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Some in Celsius’s management sounded alarm bells over this practice and attempted to lower reward rates. Mr. Mashinsky, who prioritized growth in Celsius’s customer base over profitability, however, overrode their recommendations and refused to do so. The result was that between 2018 and June 30, 2022, Celsius accrued reward obligations to customers of $1.36 billion more than the net revenue it generated from customer deposits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The disparity between Celsius’s yield on customer assets and the rewards it paid to customers was a significant reason why Celsius’s net interest margin (referred to as “NIM”), a key indicator of a financial institution’s health, was generally negative. As it did with other financial metrics (such as its profit margin for its mining business) Celsius calculated its NIM aggressively, by comparing the yield on its assets to their cost, instead of using the conventional (and more conservative) method of comparing the yield on assets to liabilities. Internally Celsius’s managers understood this had the effect of overstating Celsius’s NIM, but even as overstated, Celsius’s NIM demonstrated that Celsius was never a profitable company. As one of Celsius’s former Chief Financial Officers put it: while NIM can vary (and even at points be negative), “over time it should be around 3% as otherwise there is no business.” For much of its existence, Celsius’s NIM was either negligible or negative and was never close to 3% .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Risky Investments.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Mr. Mashinsky’s insistence that Celsius maintain its high reward rates, often over the objection of other managers, led Celsius to turn to riskier investments to increase its yield. Initially, Celsius deployed its customer assets as it advertised it would—by loaning crypto assets to institutions in the form of fully collateralized loans or allowing customers to use their crypto assets as collateral for loans Celsius made to those customers. But as Celsius’s customer base grew exponentially in the crypto market boom of 2020 and 2021, the need to increase yield to close the gap between customer reward rates and revenue led Celsius to make riskier investments. Celsius made loans that were not fully secured or were unsecured so that it could charge higher interest rates; it placed crypto assets into DeFi and staking protocols; it purchased a DeFi company, KeyFi, Inc. (a purchase that failed within months and now is in litigation); it allocated crypto assets to exchanges; and it invested approximately $604 million in the form of an intercompany loan to start a BTC mining operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Despite these material changes to its investment strategies, Celsius continued to promote the idea that it was investing customer funds in low-risk and fully collateralized institutional and retail loans. In 2021, Mr. Mashinsky told the Financial Times that “[f]rom a risk standpoint, we are probably one of the least risky businesses that regulators worldwide have ever seen.” Mr. Mashinsky continued to tell customers that “we only do asset back lending so always have 200% collateral.” In another AMA, he told customers “Celsius is very, very strict who we lend to . . . We do not do unsecured lending.” After he made this statement, Celsius’s then Chief Financial Officer wrote to Celsius’s then Head of the Trading Desk: “I just told [Mr. Mashinsky] that the number [of unsecured loans] is increasing and the overall ratio of collateral with institutions is going down.” The Chief Investment Officer responded that Mr. Mashinsky’s statements were “dangerous” because the borrowers with unsecured loans could tell everyone Mr. Mashinsky is a “liar.” Celsius’s records demonstrate just how far off the mark Mr. Mashinsky’s representations were. In December 2020, approximately 14% of Celsius’s institutional loans were wholly unsecured. By June 2021, it was routine for one-third of Celsius’s institutional loan portfolio to be wholly unsecured and more than half of the portfolio to be under-collateralized, as demonstrated in the following chart:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="media/ch09-pillay-img04.png" alt="ch09 pillay img04"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Although the above chart appears to indicate that in the Fall of 2021, fully collateralized loans increased, that is misleading because the collateral Celsius accepted did not provide real security. During that time period, Celsius accepted FTX’s native token, FTT, as collateral from FTX, despite knowing that the price of FTT was largely dependent on FTX, and thus failed to provide meaningful security against a default by FTX (the same sort of correlated risk that led lenders not to accept CEL as collateral from Celsius).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The below chart breaks down by asset type the collateral Celsius held over time:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>ASSETS PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL (12/19 – 10/21)</strong></p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Note: This chart presented to Celsius’s Risk Committee describes Celsius’s deployment of coins as collateral for loans over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In addition to making riskier loans, in 2021, Celsius recognized losses of over $800 million primarily as a result of investments with Equities First Holdings, LLC, Grayscale, KeyFi, Inc., and Stakehound. Celsius did not report these losses to its customers at the time they were incurred. None of these investments were the fully collateralized institutional loans that Celsius told its customers it was making with their crypto assets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Risk Management.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Although Celsius sold its customers on its ability to manage risk—claiming that risk management was “what Celsius does best”—Celsius did not have a risk management function or written risk policies in place before 2021. In 2021, in response to the significant losses it had suffered, Celsius hired its first risk management team—four individuals who had previously held risk compliance positions with traditional financial institutions. This new team began to institute what were described as “stop-gap” measures to allow time to implement more robust procedures in 2022.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>A key priority for this new team was developing an internal audit procedure to ensure risk policies were being followed—a critical component of a robust risk management policy. Although Celsius hired an individual for this audit role in August 2021, Celsius’s executive team delayed his proposals to implement a formal internal audit process. As a result, Celsius never fully implemented a robust risk management policy before it filed for bankruptcy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Celsius also lacked the ability to accurately track and report on its assets and liabilities, a problem that became more acute as Celsius engaged in riskier deployments. To correct for these problems, Celsius developed two internal reports—the Freeze and Waterfall Reports. But Celsius did not devote the necessary resources to fully develop its Freeze Report, viewing it as a “band-aid” until a better reporting system could be devised. In addition, Celsius employees believed that the Waterfall Report overstated its profitability. An internal Celsius document listing Celsius’s challenges noted that Celsius had “[a]bsolutely pathetic systems of records” and as a result, Celsius did “not do a good job of knowing anything about how our assets are actually performing. Our systems are horrible, and . . . can cause us to take on excessive risk.” Further, Celsius managers knew that these reports incorrectly calculated NIM and therefore presented an inaccurate and overly optimistic view of Celsius’s financial
performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Both reports also did not precisely track Celsius’s assets and liabilities and were only “directional” estimates of Celsius’s assets and liabilities. As a result, when Celsius attempted to execute more sophisticated trading strategies in 2021 and 2022 to increase its yield, it lacked the real-time information about its positions necessary to successfully execute these trades and lost over $150 million. When Celsius’s new Chief Risk Officer reviewed these losses, he expressed concern over the fact that Celsius was engaged in this type of trading because Celsius “had conveyed to the public that we take coins and lend them out.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Key Contract Terms.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Celsius’s Terms of Use, which customers accepted by clicking their agreement when opening a Celsius account, also conflicted with what Celsius told its customers. In its marketing materials and AMAs, Celsius and its managers told customers that the crypto assets they deposited with Celsius were “your assets” and that the coins belonged to the customers. But Celsius’s Terms of Use stated from March 2020 forward that a customer transferred all “rights of ownership” in her crypto assets by depositing them in a Celsius account. Similarly, Mr. Mashinsky told customers that in the event of a bankruptcy they would get their coins back, while the Terms of Use told customers (starting in March 2020) that in the event of bankruptcy they may not be able “to recover or regain ownership” of their crypto assets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Celsius’s Efforts To Erase Its Misrepresentations.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Internally, Celsius managers recognized that many of the statements that Mr. Mashinsky made during AMAs and in his tweets, particularly about how Celsius was deploying customer assets, were not true. Starting in May 2021 Celsius’s Chief Risk Officer raised the prospect of editing the AMAs after the fact and before posting them to YouTube to eliminate any misleading statements. Mr. Mashinsky resisted that suggestion fearing that any delay would create “FUD” (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) in the community. The AMA that prompted this initial concern continues to be available on the internet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Throughout 2021 and up through the bankruptcy filing, Celsius continued to identify incorrect statements Mr. Mashinsky made during the AMAs. Lists containing these misstatements were circulated internally. In some instances, Celsius was able to edit the AMAs after posting; in other instances, it was not. But what Celsius and Mr. Mashinsky never did was correct the record after the fact for the thousands of live audience members who heard these misstatements or for those who watched the recorded videos on YouTube before they were edited. Instead, in some instances, internal documents suggest that Celsius employees hoped viewers would not notice the discrepancies that had been
edited from the videos.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In every key respect—from how Celsius described its contract with its customers to the risks it took with their crypto assets—how Celsius ran it business differed significantly from what Celsius told its customers. The Examiner interviewed and communicated with a number of Celsius’s customers, many of whom stated that Celsius’s misstatements about how it would handle their crypto assets led them to invest significant crypto assets with Celsius that they would not have invested if they had understood the level of risk Celsius was taking or that many of the things Celsius presented in its AMAs, tweets, and other marketing materials were not true.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Celsius’s Collapse.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In the run-up to the June 12, 2022 pause on customer withdrawals and Celsius’s July 12, 2022 bankruptcy filing, Celsius’s problems came to a head. During a bull market, in 2021, Celsius still recorded a pre-tax loss of $811 million. As the markets began to fall in 2022, Celsius continued to lose money, reporting a first quarter loss of $165 million. The bear market also made it more difficult to close the gap between Celsius’s reward rates and the yield it could earn on its customers’ assets and fill the hole in its balance sheet as a result of its CEL buybacks and other losses. In January 2022, for example, nearly every opportunity Celsius had to deploy its BTC was below its cost of funding, contributing to an overall continuing firmwide negative NIM. As a result, Celsius’s Treasury department began pushing Mr. Mashinsky to change the way Celsius set its reward rates so that those rates did not exceed Celsius’s yield. Mr. Mashinsky continued to resist because of his belief that “all of our customers will leave us” if rates were cut. In particular, Mr. Mashinsky refused to reduce the reward rates for CEL or to suspend the ability of customers to collateralize their loans with CEL. When Celsius’s new Chief Financial Officer pressed these issues, Mr. Mashinsky told him to “tell your team to stay in their lane” and that he did not need help with marketing, as he would “bring in a few billion just like I brought in the first 20B.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Instead of lowering the reward rate for CEL, Mr. Mashinsky did the opposite. He instituted a policy that allowed any user that held 1 CEL to earn a 10% bonus on their in-CEL earnings. Celsius’s customers quickly took advantage of this new offer. Because Celsius did not charge for swaps, customers began to arbitrage, taking their higher CEL rewards and then swapping that CEL for other coins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>As Celsius struggled with its reward rates, it also began experiencing a severe and rapid reduction in its liquidity. By early May 2022, Celsius’s capital was “near zero.” And Celsius’s employees were openly speculating about its ability to survive. Between May 7 and May 9, 2022, as the price of the Terra stablecoin (UST) dropped, Celsius scrambled to reduce its exposure, escaping with a $30 million loss. By May 11, 2022, Celsius had failed its own Modeled Liquidity Outflow (or “MLO”) test. Celsius developed the MLO test to determine how much of each type of coin it would need to hold to meet anticipated withdrawals if prices dropped significantly over one day or over one week. When he tests began to fail, however, Celsius relaxed the test instead of prohibiting further deployments as its Liquidity Risk Policy required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Between May 9 and May 24, 2022, Celsius began to experience significant customer withdrawals—a net loss of over $1.4 billion in assets:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="media/ch09-pillay-img06.png" alt="ch09 pillay img06"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>On May 12, 2022, the price of CEL had fallen to $0.57, causing one employee to comment CEL was “legit being wiped out.” Celsius propped up the market that day, leading to a temporary increase in the price to $0.90, which its former Vice President of Treasury took as “proof we are the only buyers.” Later on May 12, Mr. Mashinsky directed the purchase of $5 million of CEL, but Celsius only had $1.6 million of stablecoin and could not make the purchase, marking the end of Celsius’s sustained efforts to support CEL’s price. By June 12, 2022, the price of CEL had fallen to $0.28.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>By May 27, 2022, Celsius only had sufficient liquidity to meet 30% of its BTC obligations and 21% of its ETH obligations to customers. Celsius also had triggered the modified stress test introduced only three weeks earlier. The percentage of Celsius’s assets that constituted “Deployable Liquidity” (i.e., assets Celsius could access within seven days) went from approximately 49% in February to under 33% by the end of May and under 24% by the Pause. In other words, a substantial majority of Celsius’s assets were essentially unavailable to meet withdrawal requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Throughout May 2022, as Celsius’s employees openly expressed the view that Celsius was a “sinking ship” without a plan, Mr. Mashinsky continued to assure customers that all was well at Celsius. On May 11, 2022, both Celsius and Mr. Mashinsky posted on Twitter that “All user funds are safe.” That same day, Mr. Mashinsky posted that “Celsius has not experienced any significant losses and all funds are safe.” At the beginning of the May 13, 2022 AMA, he stated “Celsius is stronger than ever.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Celsius also continued to focus on growth, attempting to attract additional deposits by offering promo codes and reassurances about its liquidity. In a May 27, 2022 AMA, Celsius offered rewards for referring friends to Celsius. On May 29, 2022, Mr. Mashinsky offered to pay $1,000 to one new Celsius customer that week.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In early June 2022, Mr. Mashinsky continued to publicly represent that customers’ crypto assets were safe at Celsius. He pushed promo and referral codes to attract new customers. But on June 5, 2022, a report appeared that Stakehound lost the keys to 35,000 of Celsius’s ETH one year earlier in May 2021—a loss that Celsius had not previously made public. In response to those reports, between June 7 and 10, 2022, Celsius published a series of blog posts and continued to livestream AMAs in which it continued to emphasize its core themes of transparency and liquidity. Mr. Mashinsky told a June 10 AMA audience that Celsius had “billions” in liquidity. Behind the scenes, on June 9, 2022, the Risk Committee reported that additional withdrawals would deplete Celsius’s liquidity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>By June 12, 2022, Celsius was forced to pause all withdrawals. One month later, on July 12, 2022, Celsius filed its chapter 11 petition. Celsius’s former Vice President of Treasury summed up Celsius’s problems as follows: “Pay unsustainable yields so you can grow AUM [assets under management], forcing you to take on more risk, experience losses bc of those risks + bad controls / judgment and you are where you are.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Celsius’s Use Of New Customer Assets To Fund Withdrawals.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Court directed the Examiner to investigate “whether the Debtors used new deposits being made by customers to make payments or otherwise meet obligations to existing customers at a time when the Debtors had no other sources (whether liquid or which could have been monetized) from which to make such payments or meet such obligations.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>To address this question, the Examiner assessed Celsius’s liquidity in the time period leading up to the pause of customer withdrawals. Celsius ranked its assets based on their ability to be liquidated within certain time frames. Assets ranked in Tier 1 were capable of being liquidated immediately and assets ranked in Tiers 5 and 6 were considered illiquid because only a small percentage of deployments in these tiers could be unwound. Assets in Tiers 2, 3, and 4 were capable of being liquidated in one day, two to three days, and four to seven days respectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Examiner reviewed all coin types and then for each coin category, the percentage of assets within each tier, as categorized by Celsius, and included all assets under management. The charts below depict the liquidity shortfall in respective tiers over all coins between February 28 and June 20, 2022.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>As these charts demonstrate, due in part to the billion-dollar hole in its balance sheet, Celsius lacked liquidity to cover anticipated future withdrawals, and its remaining liquid assets were being quickly depleted. If Celsius had not instituted the Pause and the run on the bank continued, new customer deposits inevitably would have become the only liquid source of coins for Celsius to fund withdrawals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>But as of the Pause, Celsius appeared to satisfy the withdrawal requests from the commingled pool of crypto assets under management. In some instances, however, between June 9 and June 12, Celsius did directly use new customer deposits to fund customer withdrawal requests. The detail regarding these transactions is set forth in the Report. The Examiner’s identification of the instances where Celsius directly used new customer deposits to fund customer withdrawals is not a comprehensive or exhaustive list of all transactions for all time periods.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Celsius Mining’s Utility Obligations.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Examiner also was tasked with investigating the “current status of the utility obligations of Celsius’s Bitcoin mining business.” Celsius Mining LLC (“Celsius Mining”) conducts its Bitcoin mining at sites operated by third-party hosts and at sites it owns and operates. The fees it pays its third-party mining hosts include utility charges. Celsius Mining pays utilities directly for the sites it owns and operates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Celsius Mining’s unpaid utility-related bills total $13,982,152. Of this amount, $8,381,830 consists of post-petition amounts owed to one of its mining hosts that are disputed. The remaining balance of $5,600,322 consists of pre-petition invoices that are either disputed or that were not paid due to the bankruptcy filing. Celsius Mining’s mining hosts, however, also hold prepayment balances totaling $46,809,756, which may be available to offset Celsius Mining’s obligations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Celsius’s Use, Value Added, And Sale Tax Obligations.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Examiner’s investigation into Celsius’s “procedures for paying sales taxes, use taxes and value added taxes” uncovered significant tax compliance deficiencies. Celsius did not employ any dedicated tax professionals for the first three years of its existence. Once Celsius established a tax department in June 2021, its professionals failed to institute the necessary systems and procedures to ensure that its operating subsidiaries complied with their use tax and value added tax (“VAT”) obligations on a timely basis. The result is that Celsius Mining owed $16.5 million in use taxes as of the Petition Date and may owe $6.6 million in use taxes after the Petition Date. In addition, Celsius Network Limited (“Celsius Network (UK)”), a United Kingdom private limited company, which until August 2021 operated Celsius’s customer-facing network business, has reserved $3.7 million for its potential VAT liability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Celsius Mining incurs significant use tax liabilities, primarily when deploying mining rigs in the United States that it purchased from foreign vendors that do not collect sales tax as part of the transactions and when there is no available tax exemption or exclusion. When Celsius Mining deploys those mining rigs (i.e., starts operating the mining rigs), it must pay use tax to the jurisdiction in which the mining rigs will be operated. Celsius Mining also has the potential to incur additional use tax when it moves mining rigs from one jurisdiction to another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>With respect to use taxes, the Examiner’s investigation revealed that Celsius and Celsius Mining lacked adequate systems and procedures to track and to timely pay use taxes when due. These failures, however, did not create use tax compliance failures until 2022. Prior to 2022, Celsius Mining’s use tax obligations were satisfied by either paying sales tax to its United States vendors when no exemptions or exclusions were available or relying on its data center host, Core Scientific, Inc., to identify and obtain the appropriate exemptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>That changed in 2022 when Celsius Mining began purchasing mining rigs from foreign vendors that did not collect sales taxes, triggering the obligation to pay use taxes. Although contemporaneous emails and other documents demonstrate that questions were raised at the end of 2021 and throughout the spring of 2022 about the need to address use tax issues with respect to the foreign-sourced mining rigs that were expected to be deployed in 2022, no one in Celsius’s tax department took responsibility for ensuring that Celsius Mining was addressing its use tax obligations. As a result, neither Celsius Mining nor Celsius’s tax department applied for relevant use tax exemptions in Pennsylvania and Georgia—the two states in which Celsius Mining deployed foreign-purchased mining rigs before the bankruptcy filing. Lior Koren, Celsius’s most senior tax professional, told the Examiner that it was “unknown to [him]” how or why Celsius Mining did not apply for use tax exemptions on a timely basis. Celsius’s tax professionals are attempting to mitigate the consequences of this failure, but if those efforts are unsuccessful, Celsius Mining will owe  ubstantial pre-petition use taxes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Celsius Mining’s lack of coordination with Celsius’s tax department continued even after June 2022, when Mr. Morgan told the Examiner he first believed he had responsibility for ensuring Celsius Mining’s compliance with its use tax obligations. After the filing of the bankruptcy cases, Celsius Mining deployed foreign-sourced mining rigs in Texas, triggering an estimated $6.6 million in use tax liabilities. Celsius’s tax professionals are now working after the fact to address this liability, which has not been paid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>With respect to Celsius Network (UK)’s VAT liability, in 2021, Celsius engaged Mazars to advise on its VAT obligations. Celsius Network (UK) did not receive its first letter from Mazars about its obligation to register with the United Kingdom’s tax authority, HM Revenue &amp; Customs (“HMRC”) and pay VAT until January 14, 2022—two years after it first met the threshold to register with HMRC and pay VAT. Celsius explains this delay by pointing to the fact that its first tax professional was not on board until June 2021.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Based on Mazar’s advice, Celsius Network (UK) believes that it was not required to register with the United Kingdom’s applicable taxing authority until January 2020 and that Celsius Network (UK) owes approximately $1.085 million in VAT for its business activities between January 1, 2020 and July 31, 2021. Celsius Network (UK) is now working with Mazars to complete its registration, and it intends to file a VAT return and seek mitigation of any late penalties associated with the VAT it owes. Celsius Network (UK) has obtained professional advice that its activities no longer trigger VAT obligations because it transferred its customer-facing business to a U.S. entity in August 2021.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>III. Investigative Steps.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Examiner’s Final Report is the culmination of her review of voluminous data and records, as well as information gathered during interviews of current and former Celsius employees, customers, and vendors. The Examiner also met with numerous interested parties, including representatives of Celsius, the Unsecured Creditors’ Committee, state and federal regulatory agencies, and the ad hoc committees from whom she gathered relevant information.</p>

<p><strong>Founder and Majority Owner of Cryptocurrency Exchange Charged with Processing Over $700 Million of Illicit Funds</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The founder and majority owner of a cryptocurrency exchange, Bitzlato Ltd. (Bitzlato), was arrested last night in Miami for his alleged operation of a money transmitting business that transported and transmitted illicit funds and that failed to meet U.S. regulatory safeguards, including anti-money laundering requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Anatoly Legkodymov, 40, a Russian national who resides in Shenzhen, People’s Republic of China, is scheduled to be arraigned this afternoon in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. French authorities and the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) are taking concurrent enforcement actions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>“Today the Department of Justice dealt a significant blow to the cryptocrime ecosystem,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. “Overnight, the Department worked with key partners here and abroad to disrupt Bitzlato, the China-based money laundering engine that fueled a high-tech axis of cryptocrime, and to arrest its founder, Russian national Anatoly Legkodymov. Today’s actions send the clear message: whether you break our laws from China or Europe – or abuse our financial system from a tropical island – you can expect to answer for your crimes inside a United States courtroom.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>“As alleged, the defendant helped operate a cryptocurrency exchange that failed to implement required anti-money laundering safeguards and enabled criminals to profit from their wrongdoing, including ransomware and drug trafficking,” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “The National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team’s tremendous efforts to disrupt Bitzlato and arrest the defendant demonstrate that we will continue to work with our partners – both foreign and domestic – to combat cryptocurrency-fueled crimes, even if they transcend international borders.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>According to court documents, Legkodymov is a senior executive and the majority shareholder of Bitzlato, a Hong Kong-registered cryptocurrency exchange that operates globally. Bitzlato has marketed itself as requiring minimal identification from its users, specifying that “neither selfies nor passports [are] required.” On occasions when Bitzlato did direct users to submit identifying information, it repeatedly allowed them to provide information belonging to “straw man” registrants.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>“Institutions that trade in cryptocurrency are not above the law and their owners are not beyond our reach,” said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. “As alleged, Bitzlato sold itself to criminals as a no-questions-asked cryptocurrency exchange, and reaped hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of deposits as a result. The defendant is now paying the price for the malign role that his company played in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>As a result of these deficient know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, Bitzlato allegedly became a haven for criminal proceeds and funds intended for use in criminal activity. Bitzlato’s largest counterparty in cryptocurrency transactions was Hydra Market (Hydra), an anonymous, illicit online marketplace for narcotics, stolen financial information, fraudulent identification documents, and money laundering services that was the largest and longest running darknet market in the world. Hydra users exchanged more than $700 million in cryptocurrency with Bitzlato, either directly or through intermediaries, until Hydra was shuttered by U.S. and German law enforcement in April 2022. Bitzlato also received more than $15 million in ransomware proceeds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>“The FBI will continue to pursue actors who attempt to mask their criminal activity behind keyboards and use means such as cryptocurrency to evade law enforcement,” said Associate Deputy Director Brian Turner of the FBI. “We, along with our federal and international partners, will work relentlessly to disrupt and dismantle these types of criminal enterprises. Today’s arrest should serve as a reminder the FBI will impose risk and consequences upon those who engage in these activities.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>“As alleged today, Legkodymov knowingly allowed Bitzlato to become a perceived safe haven for funds used for and resulting from a variety of criminal activities,” said Assistant Director in Charge Michael J. Driscoll of the FBI New York Field Office. “The FBI and our partners remain steadfast in our commitment to keeping cryptocurrency markets – as with any financial market – free from illicit activity.  Today’s action should serve as an example of this commitment as Legkodymov will now face the consequences of his actions in our criminal justice system.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>As alleged in the complaint, Bitzlato’s customers routinely used the company’s customer service portal to request support for transactions with Hydra, which Bitzlato often provided, and admitted in chats with Bitzlato personnel that they were trading under assumed identities. Moreover, Legkodymov and Bitzlato’s other managers were aware that Bitzlato’s accounts were rife with illicit activity and that many of its users were registered under others’ identities. For instance, on May 29, 2019, Legkodymov used Bitzlato’s internal chat system to write to a colleague that Bitzlato’s users were “known to be crooks,” using others’ identity documents to register their accounts. Legkodymov was repeatedly warned by colleagues that Bitzlato’s customer base consisted of “addicts who buy drugs at [] Hydra” and “drug traffickers,” with one senior executive even stressing that Bitzlato should combat drug dealers only “nominally,” to avoid hurting the company’s bottom line. An internal spreadsheet saved in Bitzlato’s shared management folder encapsulated the company’s view of itself: “Positives: No KYC. . . . Negatives: Dirty money. . . .”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>As alleged in the complaint, although Bitzlato claimed not to accept users from the United States, it did substantial business with U.S.-based customers, and its customer service representatives repeatedly advised users that they could transfer funds from U.S. financial institutions. Moreover, Legkodymov – who himself administered Bitzlato from Miami in 2022 and 2023 – received reports reflecting substantial traffic to Bitzlato’s website from U.S.-based Internet Protocol addresses, including over 250 million such visits in July 2022.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Legkodymov is charged with conducting an unlicensed money transmitting business. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Concurrent with the arrest announced today, French authorities, working with Europol and partners in Spain, Portugal, and Cyprus, dismantled Bitzlato’s digital infrastructure, seized Bitzlato’s cryptocurrency, and took other enforcement actions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In addition, the Treasury Department’s FinCEN announced an Order pursuant to section 9714(a) of the Combating Russian Money Laundering Act, as amended, identifying Bitzlato as a “primary money laundering concern” in connection to Russian illicit finance. The order imposes a special measure prohibiting certain transmittals of funds involving Bitzlato by any covered financial institution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) Trial Attorneys Alexander Mindlin, Scott Meisler, and Matthew Blackwood of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Artie McConnell for the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the case, with assistance from Paralegal Specialist Mary Clare McMahon.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The Justice Department investigated this case in close coordination with French law enforcement authorities and the Treasury Department’s FinCEN, both of which took separate enforcement actions today under their respective authorities. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs and the FBI’s Legal Attaché in France provided critical assistance in this case, with significant support from the department’s Cyber Operations International Liaison. The NCET and U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York also extend their appreciation to the Cyber Division of the Paris Prosecution Office and to France’s Gendarmerie Nationale Cyberspace Command (Cyber Crime Investigation Unit / C3N). Assistance was also provided by the Customs and Border Protection, the Transportation Safety Administration, and the New York City Police Department. EUROPOL and Dutch and Belgian authorities have contributed to the overall investigation with respect to operational expertise, coordination, and information-sharing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The NCET was established to combat the growing illicit use of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Under the Criminal Division, the NCET conducts and supports investigations into individuals and entities that enable the use of digital assets to commit and facilitate a variety of crimes, with a particular focus on virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and infrastructure providers. The NCET also sets strategic priorities regarding digital asset technologies, identifies areas for increased investigative and prosecutorial focus, and leads the department’s efforts to collaborate with domestic and foreign government agencies as well as the private sector to aggressively investigate and prosecute crimes involving cryptocurrency and digital assets.</p>

<p>WHEREAS, in 2015, the Department became the first financial regulator to establish a licensing and regulatory regime for virtual currency businesses;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>WHEREAS, this licensing regime subjects applicants to rigorous standards in order to allow them to do business in New York State in a manner that is protective of the safety and soundness of the financial system as well the interests of New York consumers;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>WHEREAS, as part of this regulatory regime, the Department conducts robust examinations and oversight of licensed entities to ensure that they operate in accordance with all Department regulations;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>WHEREAS, Coinbase, along with its parent and affiliates, operates a cryptocurrency trading platform with more than 100 million users worldwide;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>WHEREAS, Coinbase was licensed by the Department to engage in virtual currency business activity and as a money transmitter in New York State in 2017;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>WHEREAS, in 2020, the Department conducted a safety and soundness examination of Coinbase for the period July 1, 2018, through December 31, 2019, and found serious deficiencies in Coinbase’s compliance function across multiple areas (the “Examination”);</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>WHEREAS, as a result of the Examination findings, the Department required Coinbase to hire an independent consultant (“Independent Consultant”) to assess its Bank Secrecy Act / Anti-Money Laundering (“BSA/AML”) and Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) Sanctions Program (together, the “Compliance Program”), and to provide recommendations on areas for improvement of the Examination shortcomings, and the Independent Consultant provided a report in February 2021, following which Coinbase adopted a remediation plan to enhance its Compliance Program;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>WHEREAS, in 2021, the Department began an enforcement investigation into the various compliance issues identified during the Examination;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>WHEREAS, notwithstanding that Coinbase undertook remedial efforts in response to the Examination, Coinbase’s compliance system failed to keep up with the dramatic and unexpected growth of Coinbase’s business, and, by the end of 2021, was overwhelmed, with a substantial backlog of unreviewed transaction monitoring alerts, exposing its platform to risk of exploitation by criminals and other bad actors;</p>

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>WHEREAS, in response to the Monitor Report and working with the Independent Monitor, Coinbase has developed a further, targeted remediation plan;</p>

<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>THE DEPARTMENT’S FINDINGS</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="underline">Introduction and Procedural History</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Respondent Coinbase is a Delaware corporation formed in May 2012 and is the owner of a cryptocurrency trading platform. It is the wholly owned subsidiary of Coinbase Global, Inc. that operates in the United States. In January 2017, the Department issued to Coinbase licenses to operate both a virtual currency business and money transmitter business in the State of New York. When it received its licenses, Coinbase signed a Supervisory Agreement with the Department whereby Coinbase agreed to be subject to the oversight of the Department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the aggregate, Coinbase’s business operations are substantial in both size and volume and are comparable to more traditional financial institutions such as large banks in terms of customer base and assets on its platform. Coinbase entities employ more than 4,000 people worldwide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coinbase’s business, customer base, and transaction volumes have grown considerably since it was licensed by the Department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning in May 2020, the Department conducted a supervisory examination of Coinbase for the time period July 1, 2018, through December 31, 2019 (the “Examination”). A Report of Examination (the “ROE”) detailing the results of that examination was transmitted to Coinbase’s leadership in September 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As discussed more fully below, the Department’s Examination found significant deficiencies across Coinbase’s compliance program, including its Know-Your-Customer/Customer Due Diligence (“KYC/CDD”) procedures, its Transaction Monitoring System (“TMS”), and its OFAC screening program. The Examination also found that Coinbase failed to conduct adequate annual Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) risk assessments since 2017, as required by 23 NYRCC 200.15(b), and that Coinbase had not provided evidence of a validation review of its TMS system, as required by 23 NYCRR 504.3(a).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result of these findings, Coinbase made commitments to the Department to improve its BSA/AML and OFAC compliance programs, including engaging an Independent Consultant. Working with the Independent Consultant, Coinbase developed a remediation plan and took steps toward improving its Compliance Program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2021, the Department also began an enforcement investigation to determine whether legal violations had occurred as a result of Coinbase’s compliance deficiencies. The Department’s investigation uncovered substantial lapses in Coinbase’s KYC/CDD program, its TMS, and in its AML and OFAC sanctions controls systems, as well as issues concerning Coinbase’s retention of books and records, and with respect to meeting certain of its reporting obligations to the Department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In late 2020 and in 2021, Coinbase did take certain steps to remediate the issues identified by the Department and the Independent Consultant. However, substantial weaknesses remained, and, over the course of 2021, it became clear that Coinbase’s compliance system was inadequate to handle the growing volume of Coinbase’s business, a situation that was exacerbated by tremendous growth in its customer base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indeed, during the course of the Department’s investigation, the compliance situation inside Coinbase reached a critical stage. By the end of 2021, Coinbase had a backlog of unreviewed transaction monitoring alerts grew to more than 100,000 (many of which were months old), and the backlog of customers requiring enhanced due diligence (“EDD”) exceeded 14,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These backlogs were exacerbated by business and operational growth occurring in 2020 through 2021. For example, Coinbase customer sign ups in May 2021 were fifteen times January 2020 levels, and monthly transactions in November 2021 were twenty-five times January 2020 levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At that time, Coinbase lacked sufficient personnel, resources, and tools needed to keep up with these alerts, and backlogs rapidly grew to unmanageable levels. This was compounded by Coinbase’s reliance in 2019 through November 2021 on an inadequate case management system for dispositioning alerts and filing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Department determined that the Coinbase compliance program required further intervention. Accordingly, the Department took action, and, pursuant to an MOU entered into with Coinbase on February 10, 2022, the Department required that the Company retain an Independent Monitor, to be selected by the Department, to assess the current status of Coinbase’s Compliance Program and to assist the Company in addressing deficiencies. Following consultation with the Department, the Independent Monitor was retained in April 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In August 2022, the Independent Monitor issued the Monitor Report on the state of Coinbase’s compliance program finding that, although Coinbase had made some progress in remediating its compliance issues, certain deficiencies persisted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In response, Coinbase developed with the Independent Monitor an additional targeted remediation plan. Coinbase’s work to implement this plan is ongoing, and Coinbase continues to report its progress to the Department.</p>

<p><span class="underline">The Role of the Department and Its Regulatory Framework</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="15">
<li>
<p>The Department is the financial services regulator in the State of New York, and its head, the Superintendent of Financial Services, bears the responsibility of ensuring the safety and soundness of New York’s financial services industry and promoting the reduction and elimination of fraud, abuse, and unethical conduct with respect to financial institutions licensed to operate in the state. The Superintendent has the authority to conduct investigations, to bring enforcement proceedings, to levy monetary penalties, and to revoke the license of entities who have violated the relevant laws and regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Department developed and oversees a first-of-its-kind regulatory framework pertaining to virtual currency businesses. Companies that conduct virtual currency business activity<a href="#aml_coinbase_footnote_1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a> in the State of New York must be licensed to do so by the Department, through what is known as a BitLicense (or through the Department’s Limited Purpose Trust Charter), and are subject to the Department’s ongoing supervision. BitLicensees are also required to obtain a money transmitter license from the Department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the holder of both a money transmitter license and a BitLicense, Coinbase is obligated to abide by the Department’s regulations applicable to both money transmitters and virtual currency businesses. Coinbase is also obligated to comply with the requirements set forth in the Department’s transaction monitoring and sanctions filtering regulation and the Department’s cybersecurity regulation. The Superintendent has the power to seek penalties for violations of these various regulations under one or both of the New York Banking Law and/or the New York Financial Services Law.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>The Virtual Currency Regulation</em></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="18">
<li>
<p>The specific obligations of virtual currency companies are set forth in Part 200 of the Superintendent’s Regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section 200.15 of Title 23 of the New York Codes, Rules, and Regulations, for example, requires virtual currency licensees to establish and maintain an AML program based on a risk assessment that will consider legal, compliance, financial, and reputational risks associated with the licensee’s activities, services, customers, counterparties, and geographic location. The AML program shall, at a minimum: (1) provide for a system of internal controls, policies, and procedures designed to ensure ongoing compliance with all applicable anti-money laundering laws, rules, and regulations; (2) provide for independent testing for compliance conducted by qualified internal personnel of the Licensee or a qualified external party; (3) designate a qualified individual or individuals responsible for coordinating and monitoring day-to-day compliance; and (4) provide ongoing training for appropriate personnel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section 200.15(h) requires virtual currency licensees to maintain a customer identification program, and must, at a minimum, verify the customer’s identity, to the extent reasonable and practicable, maintain records of the information used to verify such identity, including name, physical address, and other identifying information, and check customers against the Specially Designated Nationals (“SDNs”) list maintained by OFAC. Furthermore, for accounts involving foreign entities, licensees must establish enhanced due diligence policies, procedures, and controls to detect money laundering, including assessing the risk presented by such accounts based on the nature of the foreign business, the type and purpose of the activity, and the anti-money laundering and supervisory regime of the foreign jurisdiction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section 200.15(e)(3) further requires that licensees shall monitor for transactions that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other illegal or criminal activity and shall file Suspicious Activity Reports (“SARs”) in accordance with applicable federal laws, rules, and regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section 200.15(b) also requires that licensees shall conduct an initial risk assessment that will consider legal, compliance, financial, and reputational risks associated with the licensee&#8217;s activities, services, customers, counterparties, and geographic location and shall establish, maintain, and enforce an anti-money laundering program based thereon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Superintendent is empowered to impose civil monetary penalties for violations of Part 200 pursuant to Section 408(a)(2) of the New York Financial Services Law.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>The Money Transmitter Regulation</em></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="24">
<li>
<p>The general regulations applicable to licensed money transmitters are found in Part 406 of the Superintendent’s Regulations, and the regulation specific to money transmitters’ obligations to maintain an anti-money laundering program is found in Part 417.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section 417.2 of Title 3 of the New York Codes, Rules, and Regulations requires money transmitter licensees to establish and maintain an anti-money laundering program that complies with applicable Federal anti-money laundering law. The AML program must, at a minimum (i) provide for a system of internal controls to ensure ongoing compliance; (ii) provide for independent testing for compliance conducted by bank personnel or by an outside party; (iii) designate an individual or individuals responsible for coordinating and monitoring day-to-day compliance; and (iv) provide training for appropriate personnel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section 417.2(a) also requires money transmitter licensees to incorporate policies, procedures, and internal controls reasonably designed to assure compliance application Federal law including verifying customer identification, filing reports; creating and retaining records; and responding to law enforcement requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Superintendent is empowered to impose civil monetary penalties for violations of Part 417 pursuant to Section 44(1) of the New York State Banking Law.
The Transaction Monitoring and Filtering Program Regulation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Part 504 of the Superintendent’s Regulations establishes certain minimum requirements applicable to the transaction monitoring and OFAC screening systems of both bank and non-bank institutions, including money transmitters such as Coinbase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section 504.3(a) of Title 3 of the New York Codes, Rules, and Regulations requires that each regulated institution shall maintain a Transaction Monitoring Program reasonably designed for the purpose of monitoring transactions after their execution for potential Money Laundering/Terrorist Financing (“ML/TF”) violations and suspicious activity reporting. The transaction monitoring program must be based on the risk assessment of the institution; be reviewed and periodically updated at risk-based intervals to take into account and reflect changes to applicable ML/TF laws, regulations and regulatory warnings, as well as any other relevant information; appropriately match ML/TF risks to the institution’s businesses; have ML/TF detection scenarios with threshold values and amounts designed to detect potential money laundering or other suspicious or illegal activities; have end-to-end, pre-and post-implementation testing; have documentation that articulates the institution’s current detection scenarios and the underlying assumptions, parameters, and thresholds; have protocols setting forth how alerts generated by the Transaction Monitoring Program will be investigated, the process for deciding which alerts will result in a filing or other action, the operating areas and individuals responsible for making such a decision, and how the investigative and decision-making process will be documented; and be subject to an on-going analysis to assess the continued relevancy of the detection scenarios, the underlying rules, threshold values, parameters, and assumptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section 504.3(b) requires that each regulated institution shall maintain a Filtering Program for interdicting transactions that are prohibited by OFAC, and shall be based on the risk assessment of the institution; be based on technology, processes or tools for matching names and accounts, in each case based on the institution’s particular risks, transaction and product profiles; have end-to-end, pre- and post-implementation testing of the Filtering Program; be subject to on-going analysis to assess the logic and performance of the technology or tools for matching names and accounts, as well as the OFAC sanctions list and the threshold settings to see if they continue to map to the risks of the institution; and documentation that articulates the intent and design of the Filtering Program tools, processes or technology.</p>

<p><em>The Cybersecurity Regulation</em></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="32">
<li>
<p>Part 500 of the Superintendent’s Regulations establishes a comprehensive cybersecurity framework that is applicable to the Department’s licensees, including money transmitter and BitLicense licensees such as Coinbase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section 500.17 requires that each covered entity shall notify the Department as promptly as possible but in no event later than 72 hours from a determination that a cybersecurity event has occurred where either notice is required to be provided to any government body, self-regulatory agency or any other supervisory body, or where the event has a reasonable likelihood of materially harming any material part of the normal operation(s) of the covered entity.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="underline">Coinbase’s Compliance Deficiencies</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="35">
<li>
<p>During at least the time period covered by the Department’s Examination, Coinbase was not in compliance with laws and regulations concerning Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) and AML obligations, reporting requirements, and recordkeeping requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most serious noncompliance concerns Coinbase’s ML/TF compliance program, specifically in its customer onboarding and transaction monitoring obligations. Coinbase has acknowledged its failures in this respect to the Department. Furthermore, certain of these issues have been known to Coinbase since at least 2018, flagged through both internal assessments and external reviews, including examinations conducted by the Department. Although Coinbase has worked to correct these issues, its progress has been slow: progress in certain areas did not occur until recently, and work remains outstanding to the present.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="underline">Know-Your-Customer/Customer Due Diligence Deficiencies</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="37">
<li>
<p>The foundation of an adequate ML/TF compliance system is the maintenance of robust KYC/CDD policies, procedures, and processes tailored to the specific risks posed by the entity’s business activities. KYC/CDD requirements protect financial systems by ensuring that financial services providers truly “know” their customers by understanding the nature and purpose of the customer’s business, the source of the customer’s funds, and the customer’s true identity or ownership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Up-to-date and verified KYC/CDD information allows a financial institution to assign an appropriate “risk score” or “risk rating” to its customers, which should, in turn, determine the proper amount of oversight the institution must exercise over its customers. For example, customers assigned a higher risk score should be subject to greater enhanced due diligence (“EDD”),<a href="#aml_coinbase_footnote_2"><sup><strong>(2)</strong></sup></a> as well as more regular customer due diligence refreshes, than a customer assigned a lower risk score. This regular monitoring of high-risk customers is intended to enable companies to track their customers’ activity for risky or inconsistent behavior, and to respond appropriately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During much of the relevant period, Coinbase’s KYC/CDD program, both as written and as implemented, was immature and inadequate. Coinbase treated customer onboarding requirements as a simple check-the-box exercise and failed to conduct appropriate due diligence. Examples of Coinbase&#8217;s customer due diligence failures during much of this timeframe include:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Prior to December 2020, Coinbase often failed to assign an informed “risk rating” to individual retail customers at the time of onboarding, and no quality assurance process was in place concerning risk rating until September 2021;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coinbase’s customer due diligence file from its retail customers historically consisted of little more than a copy of a photo ID;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coinbase historically did the bare minimum to verify customer due diligence information for customers, relying on self-reported social media profiles while overlooking information that was, on its face, clearly inaccurate, and/or incomplete;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to July 2021, Coinbase allowed customers to open accounts without supplying essential information such as annual expected activity, and account purpose;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coinbase failed to timely conduct EDD on high-risk customers and for a time had a substantial backlog of open EDD cases as of July 11, 2022, for example, there were over 10,000 cases in the backlog for Coinbase and its affiliates;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coinbase’s analysts, when they historically performed EDD, often asked for the bare minimum of identifying documents, conducted only a cursory review of the material provided, and at times accepted responses that were either non- or partially- responsive.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coinbase’s lack of knowledge about its customers exposed the Company and the financial system to increased ML/TF risk. Appropriately, Coinbase’s compliance program is “risk-based,” that is, the amount of scrutiny an account or transaction is given depends upon the risk rating assigned to the account. Such a risk-based system, however, is only effective if the risk rating is conducted rationally, and that simply did not happen at Coinbase (and in many cases still has not happened) for accounts opened prior to December 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result of its ongoing engagement with the Department, and in recognition of the risks presented by operating with incomplete and/or inaccurate customer due diligence data, Coinbase committed to completing a risk-prioritized KYC Refresh and using provided information to update risk scores for all of its trade eligible retail customers who onboarded before September 2021. That process has been slow, however, and despite this incomplete customer due diligence, Coinbase has not placed restrictions on all of these historical accounts while it undertakes this re-review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, the risks to the financial system due to this weakness are not merely theoretical, but have already resulted in suspicious or unlawful conduct being facilitated through Coinbase’s platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, the Department’s investigation identified issues with a former Coinbase customer who was criminally charged in the 1990s with crimes related to child sexual abuse material (“CSAM”). This publicly available information was not discovered by Coinbase at the time of onboarding, and thus the customer was not designated as high risk and no specially tailored controls or restrictions were imposed. For more than two years, this customer engaged in suspicious transactions potentially associated with illicit activity without detection by Coinbase. Coinbase eventually detected the activity, reported it, and closed the accounts. Coinbase cooperated with law enforcement with respect to this matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In another example, in the spring of 2021, an individual purporting to be an employee of a corporation (“Corporation A”) was able to open an account on behalf of Corporation A without authorization from that corporation, and without the appropriate personal identification documentation required by Coinbase policy. As part of a sophisticated fraud, the individual was able to submit an online request form to raise the daily withdrawal limit by 50 times, which was granted despite a total lack of account activity and, therefore, no evidence that the existing thresholds were insufficient for the customer’s activity. Then, on a single day, the employee transferred more than $150 million from Corporation A’s bank account (that the employee had also gained unauthorized access to) into Corporation A’s Coinbase account. The employee then immediately converted the fiat funds into virtual currency, then immediately moved the virtual currency to a wallet off the Coinbase platform. Coinbase did not become aware of this activity until six days later, when Coinbase was contacted by Corporation’s A bank. Coinbase assisted with the investigation of law enforcement, which ultimately led to recovery of the funds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="underline">Transaction Monitoring System Deficiencies</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="45">
<li>
<p>Another bedrock ML/TF requirement is the maintenance of a transaction monitoring system (“TMS”) sufficient to monitor customers’ transactions, and to track, timely investigate, and appropriately address, any suspicious activity occurring on the institution’s platform. Pursuant to Part 504 of the Superintendent’s Regulations, Department licensees are required to have a system in place for monitoring transactions after their execution for potential ML/TF violations and suspicious activity reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generally, transaction monitoring systems are programmed to trigger an alert on certain elements of potentially suspicious transactions, which are then reviewed by specially trained compliance professionals who analyze the transaction involved in the alert. For example, TMS systems are commonly programmed to alert compliance personnel when a customer who normally transacts in low quantities suddenly begins transacting in much higher quantities. Other relevant factors include risk ratings, which in turn could impact certain triggering “thresholds” of the system. Thus, a low-risk customer may transact in higher amounts under certain scenarios without triggering an alert whereas an alert would be triggered for a similarly situated high-risk customer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As previously discussed, Coinbase’s business and customer base have grown exponentially since it was licensed by the Department, but Coinbase was unable to keep pace with the growth in the volume of alerts generated by its TMS. By late 2021, Coinbase’s failure to keep pace with its alerts resulted in a significant and growing backlog of over 100,000 unreviewed transaction monitoring alerts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The TMS alert backlog was caused, in substantial part, by Coinbase’s inability to predict or manage the growing alert volume and a lack of adequate compliance staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coinbase’s efforts to remediate this backlog encountered numerous challenges. In late 2021, Coinbase represented that it would be capable of clearing its TMS backlogs by the end of February 2022. As part of that effort, Coinbase hired more than one thousand third-party contractors to “burn through” the remainder of the backlog. At first, this approach appeared to have worked. In April 2022, Coinbase reported to the Department that the TMS backlog had been resolved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coinbase provided insufficient oversight over the third-party contractors it hired, and a substantial portion of the alerts reviewed by third parties was rife with errors. At the outset of the backlog burn down, in January and February 2022, the training Coinbase provided was not scalable for the size of the contractor force, and attendance at the training sessions was not adequately tracked. The quality control process was not always performed by the contractor organizations to the standards that Coinbase provided, and initially, Coinbase did not have a system in place to audit the quality control that was done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By March 2022, Coinbase’s Quality Assurance reviews revealed that there were serious quality issues with the work of certain outside contractors. As a result, in May 2022, Coinbase retained a third-party audit firm to review and quality check the work of three specific contractors who worked on the backlog. Those three problematic contractors together “cleared” approximately 73,000 TMS alerts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In July 2022, the third-party audit firm reported to Coinbase that, based on its sampling, of the alerts cleared by the three contractors, more than half failed the quality check. For one contractor, the failure rate was 96% in a sample of 186 alerts with respect to one kind of alert. In July 2022, Coinbase decided to re-review the approximately 11,000 alerts cleared by that contractor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coinbase did not inform the Department of these issues until July 2022 notwithstanding that it was already subject to the February 2022 MOU with the Department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In August 2022, after discussing the issue with the Independent Monitor, Coinbase decided it would also re-review the approximately 41,000 alerts cleared by another contractor that had a 73% failure rate in a sample with respect to one kind of alert.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the TMS deficiencies prevented Coinbase from properly monitoring the activity of its customers, Coinbase faced an increased risk of abuse by bad actors. Coinbase has since completed its first-level re-review of these alerts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As with the customer due diligence deficiencies, this risk is not merely theoretical. Although the full extent of activity that was contained in Coinbase’s TMS backlog has not been fully determined, the Department has identified troubling examples of suspicious conduct that should have been identified, stopped, and (in some instances) reported to authorities but was not, at least initially, due to the backlog. This includes, among other things, examples of possible money laundering, suspected CSAM-related activity, and potential narcotics trafficking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the primary reasons for requiring a TMS is so that a financial institution can identify and prevent future suspicious transactions so that bad actors are not allowed to use a financial institution to facilitate illegal activity. Simply put, because of the backlogs, Coinbase’s TMS system failed to sufficiently accomplish that goal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="underline">Suspicious Activity Reporting Deficiencies</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="58">
<li>
<p>Financial institutions have the obligation to timely investigate and report to the Federal government any suspicious activity in the form of a SAR within 30 days of detection. Another consequence of Coinbase’s failed TMS discussed above is that, as uninvestigated TMS alerts languished for months in the backlog, Coinbase routinely failed to timely investigate and report suspicious activity as required by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Department’s investigation found numerous examples of SARs filed months, some more than six months, after the suspicious activity was first known to Coinbase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, the Department found that Coinbase’s record keeping of suspicious activity investigations and reporting was insufficient. For example, Coinbase was unable to meaningfully respond to the Department’s request for data related to suspicious activity identification, tracking, and reporting that took place in 2018 and 2019 because it did not adequately track or retain that information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="underline">KYC and PEP Screening</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="61">
<li>
<p>The Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”) is a global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog that maintains lists of high-risk nations and persons. The FATF Politically Exposed Persons (“PEP”) list is a list of individuals who are or have been entrusted with a prominent function. By virtue of their public position or relationships, PEPs may present a risk higher than other customers by having access to funds that may be the proceeds of corruption or other illicit activity. Certain PEPs have used financial institutions as conduits for their illegal activities, including corruption, bribery, money laundering, and other illicit financial activity. PEP designation is not itself an indicator of illegal activity, but should make financial institutions, including Coinbase, take a closer look at the transactions of the PEP. In practical terms, this may mean enhancing the risk rating of the customer in question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While approximately 1,600 institutional customers were subject to sanctions and PEP screening at onboarding, they were not subject to ongoing sanctions or PEP screening until December 2020. According to Coinbase and consistent with FinCEN regulations, PEP screening is conducted on a risk basis. Coinbase conducts PEP screening for its customer relationships that pose the greatest risk for potential illicit activity, including for all related parties of U.S. institutional clients. Until that screening was complete, Coinbase was insufficiently aware of whether members of that customer base were at a higher risk for corruption, bribery, money laundering, and other illicit financial activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the SDN lists, OFAC maintains geographical sanctions against broad sectors of the economies of certain nations such as Iran, Cuba, Syria, Russia, and North Korea. Such prohibitions necessarily require a company like Coinbase to understand where its users are physically located. However, Coinbase allows its users to access its sites while using Virtual Private Networks (“VPNs”) or The Onion Router (“TOR”). VPNs are a means of using a proxy web address as an interface between a user and a website. TOR disseminates web traffic across a distributed and anonymous network, such that the exit nodes for the network appear to be the user’s web address. Both methods allow a user to appear to be located in a jurisdiction other than that of the user’s actual, physical location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notably, Coinbase has never promulgated a risk-based policy (for instance, instituting a rule that use of such tools raises the level of risk from medium to high, or from low to medium) for those users it detects using such tools. Instead, Coinbase allows its investigators to consider such activity as a factor in investigations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In sum, Coinbase knows there is technology widely available to circumvent geographic restrictions, knows that some of its customers use that technology, and has not structured its compliance program to fully account for the use of that technology, even if Coinbase does include certain mitigating controls addressing VPNs.</p>

</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="66">
<li>
<p>In 2021 approximately 6,000 Coinbase customers appear to have been the victims of a phishing scam unrelated to Coinbase that ultimately led to unauthorized access of those customers’ Coinbase accounts. Approximately $1.5 million was stolen from Coinbase’s New York customers. Coinbase also reimbursed all customers who lost funds and worked closely with law enforcement to help hold accountable those who orchestrated this scam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, although Coinbase was required by 23 NYCRR § 500.17 to report this event to the Department within 72 hours of its being discovered (and indeed reported the same event to the United States Secret Service on May 19, 2021), Coinbase did not report this event to the Department until September 17, 2021, five months after the event occurred. Coinbase has since updated its internal procedures to ensure timely notification of incidents are made to the Department.</p>

<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="68">
<li>
<p>In direct response to the Department’s findings and the findings and recommendations of the Independent Consultant and Independent Monitor retained at the Department’s direction, Coinbase has invested very substantial time and resources in an effort to remediate its issues and strengthen its Compliance Program more generally. With regard to KYC/EDD issues, for example, Coinbase, among other things, has implemented for all new accounts a dynamic risk rating model for both retail and institutional customers, is undertaking a KYC Refresh of all customers onboarded before the risk rating system was implemented, and has instituted new periodic review procedures. Likewise, with respect to transaction monitoring and SAR reporting, Coinbase has, among other things, upgraded its investigations portal to streamline the process of reviewing transaction monitoring alerts and filing SARs. More generally, since its active engagement with the Department began, Coinbase has hired new senior leadership and staff in its legal and financial crimes compliance function. Although implementation of certain of these systems has not been entirely successful to date, the Company and Independent Monitor are actively working to fully integrate and refine such systems.

<p>NOW THEREFORE, to resolve this matter without further proceedings, the Department and the Company stipulate and agree to the following terms and conditions:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>SETTLEMENT PROVISIONS</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="underline">Monetary Penalty</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="73">
<li>
<p>No later than ten (10) days after the Effective Date (as defined below) of this Consent Order, Coinbase shall pay a civil monetary penalty to the Department pursuant to Banking Law §§ 39 and 44 and Financial Services Law § 408 in the amount of fifty million U.S. dollars ($50,000,000.00). The payment shall be in the form of a wire transfer in accordance with instructions provided by the Department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coinbase shall not claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction or tax credit with regard to any U.S. federal, state, or local tax, directly or indirectly, for any portion of the civil monetary penalty paid pursuant to this Consent Order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Company shall neither seek nor accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or indemnification with respect to payment of the penalty amount, including but not limited to, payment made pursuant to any insurance policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining the appropriate amount of this penalty, the Department has considered all of the factors set forth in New York Banking Law § 44(5), among other considerations. Although the egregiousness of the compliance failures here are an aggravating factor, mitigating factors include Coinbase’s cooperation with the Department throughout this investigation, Coinbase’s willingness to enter into an MOU with the Department, its engagement with the Independent Consultant and the Independent Monitor, and its investment of substantial resources towards remediation and enhancement of its compliance program including in response to the Department’s concerns and its continued willingness to make further investments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="underline">Continuation of the Independent Monitor</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="77">
<li>
<p>The Independent Monitor selected by the Department has been engaged since April 2022 to assist Coinbase pursuant to the MOU.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coinbase reconfirms its commitment to cooperate fully with the Independent Monitor and the parties agree that the monitorship shall continue. The parties agree to extend the Independent Monitor’s work for a further twelve (12) months from the Effective Date of this Consent Order, extendable by the Department in its sole regulatory discretion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Independent Monitor shall issue a final report to the Department that will summarize the remediation efforts completed and provide a further evaluation of Coinbase’s compliance program, including recommendations for additional remediation that remains necessary, if any.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as modified or supplemented in the preceding paragraphs, the terms and conditions applicable to the Independent Monitor contained in the MOU and the letter of engagement between the Independent Monitor and Coinbase remain in effect.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="underline">Commitment to Invest in Compliance Improvements</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="81">
<li>
<p>Within twenty-four (24) months of the Effective Date of this Consent Order, Coinbase commits to spend no less than fifty million U.S. dollars ($50,000,000.00) on further improvements and enhancements to its compliance program (the “Compliance Investment”), given the importance of investment in long-term compliance processes, systems, and improvements. The Compliance Investment shall cover costs incurred after the Effective Date directly related to the further improvement and enhancement of Coinbase’s Compliance Program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date, and after consultation with the Independent Monitor, Coinbase shall submit to the Department for approval a plan identifying with specificity the type of activities and engagements on which it intends to spend the entirety of the Compliance Investment funds, including an expected timeline for such expenditures (the “Investment Plan”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the Department has approved the Investment Plan, Coinbase shall provide to the Department a quarterly update describing progress on the Investment Plan and detailing expenditures on the Investment Plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should the Department find that purported disbursements were allocated to activities and engagements not on the approved Investment Plan, or were otherwise inappropriate, the Department may deem, in its sole regulatory discretion, that such expenditures will not be deducted from the Compliance Investment amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fees and costs paid to the Independent Monitor after the Effective Date of this Consent Order may be counted as part of the Compliance Investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any material changes to the content or timing of the Investment Plan over the course of the 24-month period should be submitted to the Department for approval. Unless a different timeline has been specifically approved by the Department in advance, any part of the $50,000,000 Compliance Investment that remains unspent after the 24-month period set forth above is forfeitable to the Department at its discretion and in a form and manner to be directed by the Department.</p>

<p><strong>SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="1">
<li>
<p>The Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York (“OAG”) commenced an investigation pursuant to New York General Business Law § 352 et. seq. (the “Martin Act”) and Executive Law § 63(12) regarding fraud in connection with the Bitfinex trading platform and related matters. On April 24, 2019, the OAG filed a proceeding in Supreme Court, New York County pursuant to Section 354 of the Martin Act, seeking a court order to enjoin certain conduct by iFinex Inc., BFXNA Inc., BFXWW Inc. (collectively, “Bitfinex”), and Tether Holdings Limited, Tether Operations Limited, Tether Limited, and Tether International Limited (collectively, “Tether”), including the transfer of certain funds between the entities; enjoining the destruction of documents and communications relevant to the investigation; and ordering production of certain documents and information. That order was granted. In re: James v. iFinex, et al., Index No. 450545/2019 (Apr. 24, 2019), aff’d 2020 N.Y. Slip Op. 03880 (July 9, 2020).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This Settlement Agreement contains the findings of the OAG’s investigation and the relief agreed to by the OAG, Bitfinex, and Tether, whether acting through their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries (collectively, the “Parties”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The OAG finds that the conduct set forth herein violated the Martin Act and Executive Law § 63(12).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The OAG finds the relief and agreements contained in this Settlement Agreement appropriate and in the public interest. Therefore, the OAG is willing to accept this Settlement Agreement pursuant to Executive Law § 63(15), in lieu of commencing a statutory proceeding for violations of the Martin Act and Executive Law § 63(12), based on the conduct described below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bitfinex and Tether neither admit nor deny the OAG’s findings set forth below.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center underline">
<p><strong>OAG’s FINDINGS</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>I&period; <span class="underline">Bitfinex and Tether</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="6">
<li>
<p>Bitfinex operates an online platform for exchanging and trading virtual currency. Users access the Bitfinex trading platform and place orders through its website, available at www.bitfinex.com, through an associated Application Programming Interface (“API”), or via over-the-counter services. Bitfinex also provides users with the ability to store their virtual currency and transfer their holdings to a different trading platform. Bitfinex is one of the relatively few virtual currency trading platforms that allows traders to deposit and withdraw socalled “fiat” currency, including U.S. dollars, euros, pounds, and yen. Traders using the Bitfinex platform can deposit dollars with Bitfinex, convert them to virtual currency at the rates offered by Bitfinex, trade the virtual currency they have purchased, convert their virtual currency holdings back into dollars, and withdraw the funds. For that reason, it is important that Bitfinex has sufficient U.S. dollars on hand to fill withdrawal orders submitted by traders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to August 2017, Bitfinex had few geographical restrictions with respect to who could access its trading platform, meaning that New York-based users were able to create accounts, fund them with U.S. dollars, convert into virtual currency, trade, and withdraw funds. In August 2017, Bitfinex announced it would no longer permit U.S.-based users to access the trading platform, but U.S.-based business entities were still permitted to trade. In August 2018, Bitfinex’s announced exclusion of U.S.-based individual users was expanded to include all U.S.-based entities, except those entities or organizations that maintained an incorporation address outside of the United States, and met other qualifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The primary function of Tether the company is as the issuer of a virtual currency also called “tether,” a so-called “stablecoin,” a term used to describe a virtual currency that is always supposed to have the same real-dollar value. In the case of tethers, one tether is always supposed to be valued at one U.S. dollar. Tethers are listed on at least several dozen virtual currency trading platforms around the world, trading under the symbol “USDT.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to signal to the market that each tether held by users is equal to one U.S. dollar, Tether has long represented that for every outstanding tether issued and trading in the market, the company holds one U.S. dollar (“USD”) in reserve “backing” the tether. From its inception in 2014 until late February 2019, Tether represented that every outstanding tether was “backed” by, and thus should be valued at, one U.S. dollar. For example, Tether represented to users that “Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves. So 1 USDT is always equivalent to 1 USD.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In late February 2019, Tether changed its representation, stating on its website that “[e]very tether is always 100% backed by our reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities (collectively, ‘reserves’). Every tether is also 1-to-1 pegged to the dollar, so 1 USDT is always valued by Tether at 1 USD.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tether represents to users that any holder of tethers can redeem them from Tether the company at the rate of one tether for one U.S. dollar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tether is one of the most prominent and widely-traded virtual currencies. As of the date of this Settlement Agreement, Tether represents that over 31 billion tethers have been issued and are outstanding and traded in the market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bitfinex and Tether are owned and operated by a small group of executives and shareholders that are located around the world. During the time period relevant to the OAG’s investigation, and as late as early-to-mid 2018, one of Bitfinex and Tether’s senior executives lived in, and conducted his work from, New York.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>II&period; In 2017, Bitfinex and Tether Misled the Market About Tether’s U.S. Dollar Backing</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="14">
<li>
<p>Prior to 2017, Bitfinex and Tether used several Taiwan-based banks to send and receive wire transfers to fulfill client orders for U.S. dollars, and for other purposes. Wells Fargo acted as the correspondent bank. In late March 2017, Wells Fargo elected to no longer process U.S. dollar wire transfers from Bitfinex and Tether accounts, forcing the companies to find alternative banking arrangements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the time Wells Fargo stopped servicing the companies, approximately 50 million tethers had been issued and were circulating in the market. By May 31, 2017, over 108 million tethers had been issued and circulating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In June 2017, Bitfinex opened an account at a Puerto Rico-based entity named Noble Bank International (“Noble Bank”). Noble Bank was a subsidiary of New York-based Noble Markets LLC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, Tether did not open an account at Noble Bank, or any other bank, until September 15, 2017. Tether deposited the vast majority of its cash holdings (ostensibly backing USDT) into a trust account at the Bank of Montreal in the name of its General Counsel. The Bank of Montreal account never had more than $61.5 million dollars on deposit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because Tether did not have a significant bank relationship in its name from at least March 2017 until September 15, 2017, it could not directly process any fiat deposits for purchases of Tethers by customers on either the Tether website or via the Bitfinex trading platform. At the same time, neither the Tether website or the Bitfinex trading platform allowed for the direct purchase or exchange of tethers in exchange for any other virtual currency, including the two most popular virtual currencies, bitcoin and ether.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Between June 1, 2017 and September 15, 2017, Bitfinex’s Noble Bank account received USD deposits from only two institutional trading firms, one of which was located in New York. Neither of those institutional trading firms purchased tethers directly from Bitfinex or Tether during this time period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because of Tether’s inability to conduct significant banking activity during this time, it could not itself hold dollars sufficient to back the hundreds of millions of new tethers that had entered the market. Until September 15, 2017, the only U.S. dollars held by Tether ostensibly backing the approximately 442 million tethers in circulation was the approximately $61 million on deposit at the Bank of Montreal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Between June 1, 2017 and September 15, 2017, Bitfinex held approximately $382 million of Tether’s funds in a comingled account, which should have been held by Tether as “backing” for tethers then in circulation but was not. In certain documents Bitfinex and Tether produced to OAG during its investigation, Tether accounted for this amount as a “receivable” from Bitfinex. Between June 1, 2017 and September 15, 2017, the total number of tethers issued and circulating rose from approximately 108 million to 442 million.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In June 2017, Bitfinex and Tether engaged the U.S.-based firm Friedman LLP to complete an audit of both companies. Those audits were never completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By late summer 2017, online reports suggested that Tether did not have sufficient cash backing for the increasing numbers of tethers in circulation. To counter those suggestions, in early September 2017, Bitfinex and Tether requested that Friedman conduct a verification of the cash backing of tethers, which Bitfinex and Tether planned to release publicly in order to demonstrate to the market that tethers were fully backed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tether notified Friedman that the company did not have a bank account at Noble Bank (or any other institution) but were in the process of opening one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tether and Friedman agreed that Friedman would conduct the verification of Tether’s assets as of September 15, 2017.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the morning of September 15, 2017, Tether opened an account at Noble Bank. Later that day, Bitfinex transferred $382,446,847.71 from Bitfinex’s account at Noble Bank into Tether’s account at Noble Bank. Friedman conducted its verification of Tether’s assets as of 8:00 p.m. EST.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On September 30, 2017, a post to the Tether website was made, entitled “Transparency Update,” in which Tether represented the following:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock">Friedman LLP has been engaged to perform historical balance sheet audit procedures for Tether Limited. However, as the amount of Tethers in circulation has increased substantially in recent months, we have also asked Friedman to analyze our bank balances and our issued and outstanding token balance on an interim basis. Friedman agreed to perform consulting services for us in an effort to provide management with useful information concerning Tether’s cash position and Tether tokens issued and outstanding as of an interim date. Friedman was able to provide consulting services for us on an expedited basis, using a procedures date of September 15, 2017. These consulting services do not constitute anaudit [sic] or attestation engagement, which would include a significantly expanded scope of procedures and take substantially more time to complete.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
We hope that the community considers the attached memorandum for what it is: a good faith effort on our behalf to provide an interim analysis of our cash position and our issued and outstanding tokens, as part of ongoing efforts to further professionalize the transparency mechanisms of Tether Limited.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attached memorandum from Friedman contained the following graphic, redacting the account holder’s name, and redacting the names of Noble Bank and the Bank of Montreal:</p>

<li>
<p>The September 30, 2017 “Transparency Update” and the attached memorandum were misleading. At no point did Tether inform its clients or the market that from at least June 1, 2017 until September 15, 2017, tethers were not in fact not backed “1-to-1” by USD held by Tether in a bank account. Rather, the funds ostensibly backing tethers had been held in an account under the control of its General Counsel, with the balance accounted for as a “receivable” from Bitfinex. No one reviewing Tether’s representations would have reasonably understood that the $382,064,782 listed as cash reserves for tethers had only been placed in Tether’s account as of the very morning that Friedman verified the bank balance.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>III&period; In 2019, Bitfinex and Tether Misrepresented the Status of the Tether Reserves,
After Bitfinex Suffered a Massive Loss of Funds</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="30">
<li>
<p>In 2017 and 2018, Bitfinex began to increasingly rely on third-party “payment processors” to handle customer deposits and withdrawals from the Bitfinex trading platform. The primary entity Bitfinex used was a purportedly Panama-based entity known as Crypto Capital Corp. (“Crypto Capital”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An individual known as “Oz Yosef,” or “Oz Joseph,” or simply “Oz” was Bitfinex’s point of contact at Crypto Capital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By mid-2018, Crypto Capital held over $1 billion of funds that emanated from customer deposits at Bitfinex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In May 2018, Bitfinex asked “Oz” how Bitfinex could “move money efficiently out of Cryptocapital.” That request came on the heels of a report in April 2018 that the government of Poland had frozen a Crypto Capital bank account holding at least $340 million. In response, “Oz” repeatedly stated that the account freeze was temporary. In the ensuing months, “Oz” would go on to provide a number of different excuses for why he could not return the funds to Bitfinex (or its clients), including tax complications, hurdles placed by various compliance personnel at various banks, bankers being on vacation, typos in wire instructions, and corruption in the Polish government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At some point between April 2018 and July 2018, “Oz” informed Bitfinex that a Crypto Capital account in Portugal containing approximately $150 million of Bitfinex client funds had also been frozen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In July 2018, Bitfinex told “Oz,” that over eighty percent of Bitfinex’s client deposits were held at bank accounts controlled by Crypto Capital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite having nearly $500 million of customer deposits in Crypto Capital accounts purportedly “frozen,” Bitfinex nevertheless continued to direct clients to utilize Crypto Capital to fund their accounts throughout the summer of 2018.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During this time period, Bitfinex began to look for ways to stave off what Bitfinex internally characterized as a “temporary liquidity crisis.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the summer of 2018, Bitfinex borrowed $400 million from Tether. On or about August 21, 2018, and continuing through September 2018, Tether made at least four cash transfers from its account at Deltec Bank to Bitfinex’s account at Deltec Bank. To offset those cash transfers, Bitfinex directed “Oz” to transfer funds from the Bitfinex account to the Tether account at Crypto Capital. In October 2018, Bitfinex redeemed 400 million tethers to repay the debt. Those transactions were not disclosed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite efforts to stave off Bitfinex’s “liquidity crisis,” online reports continued to mount that Bitfinex was unable or unwilling to timely process client withdrawal requests. In response, Bitfinex issued the following statement to the market on October 7, 2018:</p>
<div class="olist numeric">
<ol class="numeric">
<li>
<p>Bitfinex is not insolvent, and a constant stream of Medium articles claiming otherwise is not going to change this. As one of only a very few exchanges operating since 2013, with a small team and low operating costs, we do not entirely understand the arguments that purport to show us to be insolvent without providing any explanation about why. The wallets below represent a small fraction of Bitfinex cryptocurrency holdings and do not take into account fiat holdings of any kind.<br/>
&emsp;• Bitcoin cold wallet 1<br/>
&emsp;• Ethereum cold wallet 1<br/>
&emsp;• EOS cold wallet 1<br/>
How any rational party can claim insolvency when the opposite is there for all to see is interesting and, once again, perhaps indicative of a targeted campaign based on nothing but fiction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both fiat and cryptocurrency withdrawals are functioning as normal. Verified Bitfinex users can freely withdraw Euros, Japanese Yen, Pounds Sterling and U.S. Dollars. Complications continue to exist for us in the domain of fiat transactions, as they do for most cryptocurrency-related organisations. However, we continue to do our utmost to minimise any waiting times associated with fiat deposits and withdrawals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stories and allegations currently circulating mentioning an entity called Noble Bank have no impact on our operations, survivability, or solvency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>That statement was misleading. At the time this statement was made, Bitfinex had been beseeching “Oz” for months to process client withdrawals or return the money, which “Oz” was unable or unwilling to do. The statement also misleadingly implied that the company had little or no connection to “an entity called Noble Bank,” which at that time had been Bitfinex’s bank for over a year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In October 2018, Bitfinex and Tether severed their relationship with Noble Bank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On November 1, 2018, Tether made a public statement announcing that it had established a relationship with Deltec Bank &amp; Trust Limited, headquartered in the Bahamas. In that announcement, Tether represented that “USDT in the market are fully backed by US dollars that are safely deposited in our bank accounts.” The announcement also linked to a document on Deltec letterhead and addressed to Tether Limited, dated November 1, 2018, which stated:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock">Dear Sirs:<br/>
We hereby confirm that, at the close of business on October 31, 2018, the portfolio cash value of your account with our bank was US$1,831,322,828.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next day, November 2, 2018, Tether made the first of five transfers ultimately totaling $475 million from its bank account at Deltec Bank to Bitfinex’s account at Deltec Bank. At the same time, a corresponding transfer was made from Bitfinex’s account at Crypto Capital to Tether’s account at Crypto Capital via ledger entry Bitfinex also “purchased” 150 million tethers by transferring $150 million in funds held at Bitfinex’s Crypto Capital account to Tether’s account at Crypto Capital. These transfers were not disclosed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And so, as of November 2, 2018, tethers were again no longer backed 1-to-1 by U.S. dollars in a Tether bank account, because a substantial portion of the backing in the Deltec account had been transferred to Bitfinex to make up for the funds taken by Crypto Capital, while the corresponding funds transferred from Bitfinex’s Crypto Capital account to Tether’s Crypto Capital account were impaired by Crypto Capital’s actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tether’s misrepresentation would continue until late February 2019, at which time Tether updated its website to note that “[e]very tether is always 100% backed by our reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities (collectively, ‘reserves’).” Tether did not announce that it had changed its disclosure, and indeed there were no media reports about the change until several weeks later on March 14, 2019.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout November, Bitfinex would continue to ask “Oz” to return the money, to no avail. For example, on November 1, 2018, Bitfinex told “Oz” that Bitfinex “urgently need liquidity to start paying out our small customer as your channel is stuck.” On November 21, 2018, Bitfinex told “Oz” that “We have 860m with you. I can’t believe we can’t even get 20 or 30 M out…where is all the money, it doesn’t sum up…350 in Poland, 150 in Portugal.” On November 28, 2018, Bitfinex again messaged “Oz,” stating that “we are at the end of the month and you haven’t been sending out one wire, even 1 usd for the whole month.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contrary to what was happening behind the scenes, Bitfinex issued a statement on November 11, 2018, stating that Bitfinex’s “banking remained stable,” while noting that in October 2018 alone Bitfinex “processed over 700 withdrawals representing more than $1 [billion].”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As set forth in further detail in the OAG’s application for relief pursuant to Section 354 of the Martin Act, in late 2018 Bitfinex and Tether began to negotiate a line of credit transaction that would allow Bitfinex to further draw upon the Tether reserves. Ultimately, the line of credit transaction closed at the end of March 2019, allowing Bitfinex to draw up to $900 million from the Tether reserves. The $625 million that had been previously transferred from the Tether account in November 2018 was incorporated into the line of credit. Bitfinex collateralized the line of credit with shares of its parent company Digfinex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At no time did Bitfinex or Tether disclose to the market that Tether had transferred at least $625 million to Bitfinex, or that Bitfinex had experienced critical liquidity issues because of loss of approximately $850 million to Crypto Capital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On April 24, 2019, the OAG filed an application in Supreme Court, New York County for an order pursuant to Section 354 of the Martin Act, seeking court-ordered production of documents and information relevant to its ongoing investigation of Bitfinex and Tether, as well as seeking injunctive relief to prevent Bitfinex from further accessing Tether’s reserves under the line of credit arrangement. As part of that application, the OAG disclosed to the market for the first time that Bitfinex had lost access to approximately $850 million, and that Bitfinex had made up for the shortfall by transferring hundreds of millions of dollars from Tether.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On April 26, 2019, Bitfinex issued a statement, which included a representation that “we have been informed that these Crypto Capital amounts are not lost but have been, in fact, seized and safeguarded.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That statement was misleading. At the time that statement was made, Bitfinex did not in fact know the whereabouts of all of the customer funds held by Crypto Capital, and so had no assurance that the funds might ever be made accessible again to Crypto Capital or Bitfinex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As of the date of this Settlement Agreement, Bitfinex cannot represent whether, or when, any of the unrecovered funds might be returned to Bitfinex or its clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the foregoing facts, OAG finds that Bitfinex and Tether violated New York General Business Law § 352 et seq. and Executive Law § 62(12).</p>

<p><span class="underline"><strong>COMPLAINT</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC” or “Commission”), for its Complaint against Defendants Terraform Labs PTE Ltd. (“Terraform”) and Do Hyeong Kwon (“Kwon”) (collectively “Defendants”), alleges as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>From at least April 2018 through May 2022 (“Relevant Period”), Terraform and Kwon offered and sold crypto asset securities<a href="#sec_kwonzi_footnote_1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a>  in unregistered transactions and perpetrated a fraudulent scheme that led to the loss of at least $40 billion of market value, including devastating losses for U.S. retail and institutional investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants’ crypto asset securities offerings involved an array of interrelated tokens that were created, developed, promoted, offered, and sold by Defendants as profit-seeking investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terraform and Kwon marketed the crypto asset securities to investors in the United States and abroad, repeatedly claiming that the tokens would increase in value and touting Defendants’ managerial and entrepreneurial efforts to do so.  For example, Defendants touted and marketed a Terraform-created “yield-bearing” blockchain protocol, dubbed the
Anchor Protocol, which promised to pay 19-20% interest on one of Terraform’s crypto assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants’ efforts at attracting investors and growing the size and value of the Terraform “ecosystem” were initially successful.  By April 2022, one of Terraform’s crypto asset securities, the LUNA token, had a market value among the ten highest in the world for crypto assets.  And Terraform’s so-called “stablecoin” Terra USD (“UST”) – a crypto asset security that Terraform designed to maintain a one-to-one peg to the U.S. dollar by virtue of an algorithm coded into the blockchain tying its value to LUNA – was also among the world’s largest, with a total market value of over $17 billion as of April 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants also engaged in a fraudulent scheme to mislead investors about the Terraform blockchain and its crypto asset securities.  Terraform and Kwon repeatedly – and falsely – told the investing public that a popular Korean electronic mobile payment application called “Chai” employed the Terraform blockchain to process and settle commercial transactions between customers and merchants.  If true, this would have been a breakthrough for the Terraform blockchain, a supposed real-world use that could increase the value of LUNA as demand for the token rose in connection with increased use of the Terraform blockchain. Investors bought in, purchasing LUNA and other Terraform crypto assets, based in part on Terraform’s and Kwon’s claims that Chai payment transactions were being processed and settled on the Terraform blockchain.  But in reality, Chai payments did not use the Terraform blockchain to process and settle payments.  Rather, Defendants deceptively replicated Chai payments onto the Terraform blockchain, in order to make it appear that they were occurring on the Terraform blockchain, when, in fact, Chai payments were made through traditional means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terraform and Kwon also misled investors about one of the most important aspects of Terraform’s offering – the stability of UST, the algorithmic “stablecoin” purportedly pegged to the U.S. dollar.  UST’s price falling below its $1.00 “peg” and not quickly being restored by the algorithm would spell doom for the entire Terraform ecosystem, given that UST and LUNA had no reserve of assets or any other backing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In May 2021, UST dropped below $1.00.  In response, Defendants secretly discussed with a third party that the third party would purchase massive amounts of UST to restore the $1.00 peg.  As UST returned to $1.00, Kwon and Terraform publicly and repeatedly touted the restoration of the $1.00 UST peg as a triumph of decentralization and the “automatically self-heal[ing]” UST/LUNA algorithm over the “decision-making of human agents in time of market volatility,” misleadingly omitting the actual reason why the $1.00 peg was restored:  the third party’s intervention to prop up UST’s price.  By late May, Terraform was publicly boasting to the investing public that it had purportedly proven the reliability of the UST $1.00 peg – the “lynchpin for the entire [Terraform] ecosystem” – in a “black swan” event that was “as intense of a stress test in live conditions as can ever be expected.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the UST peg was restored in May 2021, investors poured additional billions of dollars into the Terraform ecosystem, mostly through investor purchases of LUNA and UST.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One year later, in May 2022, under selling pressure from large UST holders, UST de-pegged from the U.S. dollar again.  This time, without secret intervention to save it, the price of UST and LUNA plummeted to nearly zero, bringing down with them the other crypto asset securities in the interconnected Terraform ecosystem, wiping out over $40 billion of total market value in these assets and sending shock waves through the crypto asset community.  A number of retail investors in the United States lost their life savings.  And some U.S. institutional investors lost billions of dollars in the market value of their LUNA and UST holdings.</p>

<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><strong>VIOLATIONS</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="10">
<li>
<p>As a result of the conduct alleged in this Complaint, Defendants violated the securities offering registration provisions of the federal securities laws, namely Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 77e, along with certain security-based swap provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, Section 5(e) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77e, and Section 6(l) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 78f(l).  Specifically, Defendants offered and sold crypto asset securities to investors without registering the offers and sales with the SEC as required by the federal securities laws.  Defendants further violated the federal securities laws by offering, selling, and effecting transactions in securities-based swaps, in the form of “mAssets” based on the value of underling equity securities, to non-eligible contract participants in transactions that were not executed on a national securities exchange and without having an effective registration statement filed with the Commission covering the offer and sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants’ conduct set forth in this Complaint also violated the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a), Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, along with Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78t(a).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless restrained and enjoined, Defendants will continue to violate the federal securities laws.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><strong>NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS AND RELIEF SOUGHT</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="13">
<li>
<p>The Commission brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by Section 20(b) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77t(b), and Section 21(d)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(1).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Commission seeks a final judgment: (i) ordering permanent injunctions restraining and enjoining Defendants from again violating the federal securities laws described herein; (ii) ordering Defendants to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest; (iii) ordering Defendants to pay civil money penalties; and (iv) prohibiting Defendants from (a) participating, directly or indirectly, in the purchase, offer, or sale of any crypto asset security, or (b) engaging in activities for purposes of inducing or attempting to induce the purchase, offer, or sale of any crypto asset security by others; and (v) imposing such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and appropriate.</p>

</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="15">
<li>
<p>Terraform Labs PTE Ltd. (“Terraform”) is a private company registered and headquartered in Singapore.  During the Relevant Period, Terraform had numerous employees located in the United States, including its General Counsel, Head of Research, and Director of Special Projects.  Terraform also operated a website available in the United States that offered and sold crypto asset securities to U.S.-based investors and, through its authorized representatives, often met with investors in the United States to offer and sell Terraform’s crypto asset securities.  Neither Terraform nor its offers or sales of crypto asset securities were registered with the SEC in any capacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do Hyeong Kwon, age 31, was a resident of Korea and Singapore during the Relevant Period.  Kwon is and was the ultimate decision-maker at Terraform throughout the Relevant Period.  Kwon is also the sole director, Chief Executive Officer, and majority shareholder of Terraform, owning 92% if its shares.  Press reports indicate that a Korean court issued an arrest warrant for Kwon.  His current address is unknown.  During the Relevant Period, Kwon traveled to the United States on behalf of Terraform to market, offer, and sell Terraform’s crypto asset securities.</p>

<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><strong>JURISDICTION AND VENUE</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="17">
<li>
<p>The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d) and 22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d) and 77v(a), and Sections 21(d) and 27(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78aa(a).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants and venue is proper in this District pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a), and Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a), because, among other things, some of the acts and transactions in which Defendants engaged and that constitute violations of the federal securities laws occurred in this District.  For example, as alleged herein, Defendants offered and sold securities and made materially false and misleading statements to investors located in this District in unregistered transactions.  One or more investors who purchased crypto asset securities offered by Terraform and Kwon also had their principal place of business and/or residence within this District.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, this Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because Defendants engaged in conduct within the United States that constituted significant steps in furtherance of the violations of the federal securities laws alleged in this Complaint, even if some of the transactions at issue may have occurred outside the United States and involved foreign investors; and/or further because Defendants, whether within or outside of the United States, engaged in conduct that had a foreseeable substantial effect within the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, Defendants, directly and indirectly, singly or in concert with others, have made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, the mails, and/or the facilities of a national securities exchange – namely, through Defendants’ use of the Internet and the U.S. banking system when engaging in the acts and transactions described herein.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><strong>STATUTORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="21">
<li>
<p>Congress enacted the Securities Act to regulate the offer and sale of securities. In contrast to ordinary commercial principles of caveat emptor, Congress enacted a regime of full and fair disclosure, requiring those who offer and sell securities to the investing public to provide sufficient, accurate information to allow investors to make informed decisions before they invest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act require that an issuer of securities like Terraform register offers and sales of those securities with the SEC when they offer and sell securities to the public. Registration statements relating to an offering of securities thus provide public investors with material information about the issuer and the offering, including financial and managerial information, how the issuer will use offering proceeds, and the risks and trends that affect the enterprise and an investment in its securities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The definition of a “security” under the federal securities laws includes a wide range of investment vehicles, including “investment contracts.  See 15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(1) (Securities Act Section 2(a)(1)).  Investment contracts are instruments through which a person invests money in a common enterprise and reasonably expects profits or returns derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. Courts have found that novel or unique investment vehicles constitute investment contracts, including interests in orange groves, animal breeding programs, railroads, mobile phones, crypt assets, and enterprises that exist only on the Internet. As the United States Supreme Court noted in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., Congress defined “security” broadly to embody a “flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.” 328 U.S. 293, 299 (1946).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security based swaps, which are themselves securities, include any agreement, contract, or transaction that is a swap as defined in Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and is based on a single security, including on the value thereof.  See 15 U.S.C.  § 78c(a)(68) (Exchange Act Section 3(a)(68)).  Section 1a(47) of the CEA defines “swap” to include “any agreement, contract, or transaction” that “provides on an executory basis for the exchange . . . of 1 or more payments based on the value or level of 1 or more . . . securities . . . and that transfers, as between the parties to the transaction, in whole or in part, the financial risk associated with a future change in any such value or level without also conveying a current or future direct or indirect ownership interest in [the] asset . . . .”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Securities Act Section 5(e) makes it unlawful for any person to offer to sell, offer to buy, or purchase or sell a security-based swap to any person who is not an “eligible contract participant” without an effective registration statement.  15 U.S.C. § 77e(e).  Exchange Act Section 6(l) also makes it unlawful for any person to effect transactions in security-based swaps to any person who is not an “eligible contract participant” unless the transaction is effected on a registered national securities exchange.  “Eligible contract participants” are defined to include high-net-worth individuals with “amounts invested on a discretionary basis” of $10 million (or $5 million if the individual enters into a hedging agreement) and certain types of sophisticated and/or regulated entities.  7 U.S.C. § 1a(18).</p>

<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><strong>BACKGROUND ON CRYPTO ASSETS</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="26">
<li>
<p>The term “crypto asset” generally refers to an asset issued and/or transferred using distributed ledger or blockchain technology, including assets sometimes referred to as “cryptocurrencies,” “digital assets,” “virtual currencies,” “digital coins,” and “digital tokens.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A blockchain or distributed ledger is a peer-to-peer database spread across a network of computers that records all transactions in theoretically unchangeable, digitally recorded data packages. The system relies on cryptographic techniques for secure recording of transactions.  Blockchains can also record “smart contracts,” essentially computer programs designed to execute the terms of a contract when certain triggering conditions are met.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blockchains typically employ a consensus mechanism to “validate” transactions, which, among other things, aims to achieve agreement on a data value or on the state of the ledger.  Crypto assets may be traded on crypto asset trading platforms in exchange for other crypto assets or fiat currency (legal tender issued by a country).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A blockchain “protocol” is a code, software, or algorithm that governs how a blockchain, or a feature of a blockchain, operates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On July 25, 2017, the SEC issued the Report of Investigation Pursuant to Section
21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO, advising “those who would use . . . distributed ledger or blockchain-enabled means for capital raising[] to take appropriate steps to ensure compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws,” and finding that the offering of crypto assets at issue in that report involved investment contracts and, therefore, securities.  In analyzing whether something is a security, “form should be disregarded for substance,” Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967), “and the emphasis should be on economic realities underlying a transaction, and not on the name appended thereto.” United Housing Found., Inc. v. Forman, 421 U.S. 837, 849 (1975).</p>

<p><strong>FACTS</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist upperroman">
<ol class="upperroman" type="I">
<li>
<p><strong>Defendants Created and Developed the Terraform Ecosystem.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="31">
<li>
<p>In March 2018, Defendants began creating the Terraform ecosystem.  Kwon and Terraform’s co-founder published a white paper announcing the Terraform blockchain (referred to as the “Terra protocol”) and the LUNA token, the first crypto asset created by Terraform.  Eventually, the ecosystem would come to include a series of interconnected crypto assets whose purported adoption, liquidity, and value became highly dependent on the public’s willingness to buy into Terraform and Kwon’s blockchain empire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In April 2019, Kwon and others published another white paper, entitled “Terra Money: Stability and Adoption,” that announced the adoption of so-called “stable-coins,” including one later named UST, which Terraform described as the “lynchpin” of Defendants’ interrelated “ecosystem” of crypto assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the April 2019 white paper and elsewhere, Defendants stated that UST’s value was pegged to the U.S. dollar by virtue of an algorithm tying UST’s value to LUNA. Specifically, this algorithm sought to maintain UST’s price at $1.00 through a complex system in which, rather than being backed by actual dollars, UST would be created, or “minted,” and “burned,” or destroyed, in parallel with Terraform’s companion token, LUNA.  For example, holders of LUNA could swap $1.00 worth of LUNA for 1 UST based on LUNA’s then-current market price.  And holders of UST could likewise exchange 1 UST for $1.00 worth of LUNA.  The algorithm theoretically provided an arbitrage opportunity for traders to help keep the price of UST pegged at one dollar.  If, for example, UST slipped to $0.95, traders could buy UST at that price and exchange it for $1 of LUNA “burning” UST and “minting” LUNA.  Doing so reduced the supply of UST and, in theory, would increase its price until it reached a dollar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On or about April 24, 2019, Terraform and Kwon officially launched the Terraform blockchain and created one billion LUNA tokens.  Kwon wrote the code underlying the initial version of the blockchain.  As described in more detail below, Terraform and Kwon offered and sold LUNA to investors to raise funds to develop the Terraform blockchain and ecosystem.  During the Relevant Period, Terraform maintained over a hundred code repositories that enabled Terraform employees, including Kwon, to create, contribute, maintain, and update the Terraform blockchain protocols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the Relevant Period, Terraform and Kwon continued to develop and market the Terraform blockchain and related protocols and crypto assets, which they promoted as profit opportunities for investors.  In September 2020, for example, Terraform and Kwon began publicly marketing UST as a “yield bearing” stablecoin together with something they called the Anchor Protocol.  Terraform launched the Anchor Protocol in March 2021, with Defendants advertising rates of return of 19-20% on investors’ deposited UST, leading to significant investor demand for UST.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The total amount of UST, which was first “minted” in June 2019, was slow to grow, with under 300 million UST circulating by early 2021.  In the 2 months following the launch of the Anchor Protocol, the number of UST in circulation increased by close to one billion.  By May 2022, there were approximately 19 billion UST, with 14 billion deposited in the Anchor Protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over time, Defendants created other protocols and crypto asset securities.  In December 2020, Defendants launched the “Mirror Protocol,” which they continued to develop and maintain.  The Mirror Protocol allowed users to create what Terraform called an “mAsset,” short for “mirrored asset”, which was designed to track or “mirror” the price of equity securities or other types of securities, including U.S. equity securities.  For example, mAssets designed to “mirror” the stock of Apple, Inc. were named “mAAPL” and were designed so that their value increased and decreased with the value of Apple, Inc. stock.  As Terraform explained on its website, “mAssets mimic the price behavior of real-world assets and give traders anywhere in the world open access to price exposure without the burdens of owning or transacting real assets.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Mirror Protocol also provided users with the ability to obtain a “MIR token,” the so-called “governance token”<a href="#sec_kwonzi_footnote_2"><sup><strong>(2)</strong></sup></a>  for the Mirror Protocol.  MIR tokens received value based upon, among other things, fees generated under the Mirror Protocol.</p>

<p><strong>Terraform’s Crypto Assets Were Offered and Sold As Securities.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="39">
<li>
<p>As alleged in greater detail below, Terraform offered and sold five groups of crypto asset securities: LUNA tokens, a version of LUNA called “wrapped” LUNA, UST, MIR tokens, and security-based swaps or mAssets.  Defendants solicited investors for these crypto assets by touting their profit potential.  Defendants repeatedly stated that the crypto assets would increase in value based on Terraform’s development, maintenance, and promotion of its blockchain, protocols, and the entire Terraform ecosystem.  Defendants also promoted to investors the ability to trade Terraform’s crypto assets on the secondary market, with the success of the investment again depending on Defendants’ efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants further touted the professional expertise and success of the Terraform team, including Kwon, claiming that Terraform was “led by serial entrepreneurs” and was a team with “deep relevant expertise,” and providing biographies or links to LinkedIn profiles that highlighted Terraform employees’ and Kwon’s expertise in crypto assets, finance, and technical experience with software coding, engineering, and development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, Defendants advertised their considerable efforts to ensure that UST – the “lynchpin of the [Terraform] ecosystem” – maintained its $1.00 peg.  In January 2022, Defendants announced the creation of the “Luna Foundation Guard,” which had no employees and was controlled by Kwon, with the purpose of serving as an “asset reserve [] to back the UST.”  The Luna Foundation Guard was funded with a “gift” of 50 million LUNA (at the time, worth billions of dollars) directly from Terraform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants also aggressively marketed Terraform’s crypto asset securities to U.S. investors, by posting information and promotional materials to accounts on several publicly accessible online social media platforms, such as Twitter accounts, blog posts, YouTube, and messaging applications like Telegram.  Kwon and other Terraform employees further gave interviews or quotes to media promoting its crypto assets, including U.S.-based outlets, as described in greater detail below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, during the Relevant Period, Kwon and other Terraform employees traveled to the United States to meet personally with existing and potential investors to solicit investment in Terraform’s crypto asset securities, including meetings in San Francisco and New York, and to attend and speak at an industry conference and events in New York.  Defendants’ U.S.-based promotional efforts also included a partnership with the Washington Nationals baseball team, as a result of which the word “Terra” was placed on every seat behind home plate and elsewhere around the stadium in Washington, D.C.  Defendants also arranged to have several of their crypto assets listed (made available for trading) on several major crypto asset trading platforms, including a prominent U.S.-based trading platform.</p>

<li>
<p>Investors tendered fiat currency or crypto assets in exchange for LUNA. Institutional investors typically purchased LUNA directly from Terraform after meeting with Kwon in person or via videoconference.  U.S. retail (or non-institutional) investors, who purchased LUNA from crypto asset trading platforms, including at least one trading platform in the U.S., also tendered fiat currency or crypto assets in exchange for LUNA.</p>

<li>
<p>Purchasers of LUNA invested into a common enterprise with other LUNA purchasers, as well as with Terraform and Kwon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terraform and Kwon pooled the funds received from investors to develop the Terraform ecosystem and increase the value of LUNA.  Investors in LUNA shared equally in LUNA price increases, or suffered LUNA price decreases equally, such that if one investor profited, all investors did so as well.  Because LUNA is fungible, the fortunes of LUNA purchasers were tied to one another, and each depended on the success of Defendants’ efforts and strategy and the Terraform ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specifically, proceeds of Terraform’s sales of LUNA were sent to crypto asset wallet addresses controlled by Terraform to fund Terraform’s efforts to develop and fund operations.  During fundraising presentations, Terraform and Kwon explained how Terraform would use proceeds from LUNA sales to help grow and expand the Terraform ecosystem.  For example, in August 2018, when Terraform announced its first raise of capital of $32 million, it noted that “Terra will invest the initial seed capital in building the modern financial system on the blockchain.”  In fact, Terraform presentations to investors stated that at least 20% of the initial billion LUNA tokens were to be used for development and operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, throughout the Relevant Period, Defendants held a significant amount of LUNA, tying their fortunes with respect to LUNA with LUNA investors’ fortunes.  Terraform owned hundreds of millions of LUNA tokens through the Relevant Period.  In 2020, Kwon tweeted that he had purchased 50 million LUNA, in addition to the 70 million LUNA tokens that he owned from the time of the blockchain launch in 2019.</p>

<li>
<p>Investors in LUNA reasonably expected to profit from Defendants’ efforts to develop and support the Terraform ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants publicly pitched LUNA as an investment that would increase in value with increased usage of the Terraform blockchain that could result from Defendants’ continued development and maintenance.  Defendants publicly stated that as the Terraform ecosystem grew based on Defendants’ efforts, the value of LUNA would go up as well.  As Kwon explained in an April 7, 2021 thread on Twitter (referring to LUNA as “moon”):</p>

<ol class="arabic" start="51">
<li>
<p>In the same April 7, 2021 thread, Kwon explicitly touted that the value of LUNA could grow as the Terraform “ecosystem” grows, specifically tying that potential growth to his own efforts (which he promised would be successful by touting that he would “kick ass”) while investors remained passive (or “s[a]t back”) in the enterprise.</p>
</li>

<ol class="arabic" start="52">
<li>
<p>As one Terraform employee put it in Terraform’s publicly-available Telegram messaging application, the “[v]alue of Luna grows as Terra [ecosystem] gets adopted and used.” Another Terraform employee noted in an online Ask-Me-Anything interview on Reddit: “[i]n the long-run … Terra’s transaction volume will be the main determinant of Luna’s value.”<a href="#sec_kwonzi_footnote_3"><sup><strong>(3)</strong></sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In marketing materials distributed to potential investors in January 2019, Terraform described purchases of LUNA as “investments” and LUNA buyers as “investors.”  The same materials noted that “top global exchanges and funds” already had “invested in” Terraform (referring to their purchase of LUNA), and that Terraform had raised $32 million in July 2018 from an “elite group of VCs” referring to venture capital firms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of Terraform’s offers and sales of LUNA were governed by purchase agreements between Terraform and LUNA investors.  These agreements generally entitled buyers to acquire LUNA at a discount to market prices.  By selling at a discount to market prices, Defendants incentivized buyers to seek to sell their LUNA into public markets in order to realize a profit.  Moreover, for some buyers who purchased LUNA prior to the public launch of the token, Defendants provided in some of the agreements for a gradated token distribution schedule that would control for the flow of LUNA tokens being sold into the market, such that early investors would receive their LUNA continuously over a period of 12-18 months.  These provisions controlled the release of LUNA over a longer period of time in smaller quantities, to control for potential negative effects on LUNA’s price that could occur with large distributions of LUNA into the market.  These provisions reflected the expectations of both Defendants and investors that that these LUNA investors would seek to sell their LUNA into public markets for a profit and sought to protect LUNA’s trading price by limiting amounts that could be resold during any given time period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants also engaged in efforts to develop, support, and grow the Terraform ecosystem.  Defendants publicly touted these efforts through a variety of forums, including widely accessible online social media platforms, such as accounts with Twitter and Medium, messaging applications with public channels like Telegram, and YouTube.  Terraform’s stated efforts to grow the Terraform ecosystem included four substantial version upgrades of the Terraform blockchain, adding myriad back-end technical features and front-end user applications, entering into partnerships with collaborators to develop ecosystem features, and otherwise extensively and publicly promoting the Terraform ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Defendants engaged in and touted these efforts, the market price of LUNA increased from under a dollar in early 2021 to a high of around $119.18 in April 2022, before it crashed to under a penny in May 2022, as represented by the graph below:</p>

<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="57">
<li>
<p>Defendants also provided monthly “Community Updates” on publicly available Medium blog posts, which discussed Defendants’ coding and development the Terraform ecosystem.  Similarly, Terraform employees and Kwon touted their efforts to develop and support the Terraform ecosystem in monthly investor emails that they distributed called “Terraform Labs Investor Update” (later renamed to “Terraform Labs Ecosystem Update”).  The recipients of these “Updates” had email addresses that included, for example, an email group <a href="mailto:investment@terra.money">investment@terra.money</a>.  These emails highlighted Terraform’s engineering, coding, and integration of applications to the Terraform ecosystem, among other things.  These emails also announced new Terraform hiring for positions “key” to the ecosystem’s development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terraform and Kwon also engaged in other efforts to create LUNA resale opportunities by applying to crypto asset trading platforms to make LUNA available for trading, including submitting questionnaires that provided information about LUNA and Terraform, and then furthered LUNA investors’ reasonable expectations of profits by publicly announcing new trading platform listings.</p>

<p><strong>“Wrapped” LUNA</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="59">
<li>
<p>Some crypto assets, like UST, LUNA, and the MIR tokens on the Terraform blockchain, are issued and transferred on a particular blockchain – meaning that they are represented on that blockchain.  Generally speaking, different blockchains are not interoperable with one another.  In other words, crypto assets on one blockchain cannot be automatically transferred to another blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To address this limitation, “cross-chain” and “bridge” protocols were created to allow investors to move value across blockchains.  One example is the “wrapped” LUNA token (or “wLUNA”).  These wLUNA tokens are generally created, or “bridged,” from the Terraform blockchain to another blockchain by depositing LUNA in a particular wallet address on the Terraform blockchain, and then having an associated smart contract on different blockchains, such as the Ethereum blockchain, to create wLUNA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, wLUNA could be bridged back to the Terra blockchain by having wLUNA destroyed, or “burned,” by the smart contract on the non-Terraform blockchains and receiving LUNA from the address or smart contract on the Terraform blockchain.  In essence, this mechanism created a pool of LUNA on the Terraform blockchain, through which wLUNA owners could convert their holdings back into LUNA.</p>

<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="62">
<li>
<p>Investors purchased wLUNA with other crypto assets or with fiat currency through crypto asset trading platforms.  For example, to create wLUNA, investors deposited LUNA to an address or smart contract on the Terraform blockchain, which was then “bridged” to the Ethereum or other blockchains to create wLUNA.</p>

<p>Investors in wLUNA invested in a common enterprise with other wLUNA investors and LUNA investors.  To create wLUNA, LUNA was pooled together in an address or smart contract on the Terraform blockchain.  For each LUNA that entered into the pool, a new wLUNA would be created on a different blockchain, such as Ethereum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As LUNA and wLUNA were exchangeable on a one-to-one basis, the price of wLUNA generally equaled the price of LUNA.  Therefore, holders of wLUNA shared in the rise and fall of the value of the wLUNA and LUNA token.  As a result, the fortunes of wLUNA investors were tied to one another and to the fortunes of Defendants.</p>

<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="65">
<li>
<p>Just like LUNA investors, investors in wLUNA had an expectation of profits based on the managerial efforts of Defendants because the price of wLUNA, by definition, equaled the price of LUNA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reasonable investors purchasing wLUNA either understood this economic reality, or believed that they were purchasing LUNA when they were in fact purchasing wLUNA.  In fact, Kwon himself used the terms LUNA and wLUNA interchangeably.  For instance, when Kwon tweeted about wLUNA’s availability on a prominent U.S.-based trading platform, he referred to it as “$LUNA,” which is how he frequently referred to LUNA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regardless of whether investors understood the difference between LUNA and wLUNA, investors purchased wLUNA with the understanding that the value of the token would be driven by the value of LUNA.  As described above, Defendants led investors to reasonably expect to profit from LUNA, and therefore wLUNA, based on the managerial efforts of Terraform and Kwon to develop the Terraform ecosystem.</p>

<p>The definition of security under Securities Act 2(a)(1) and Exchange Act Section 3(a)(10) includes a “receipt for” a security. As described above, when an investor “bridges” LUNA to obtain wLUNA, the owner of the wLUNA has the right and ability at any time to exchange the wLUNA for LUNA, which was offered and sold as a security.  This mechanism created a pool of LUNA on the Terraform blockchain through which wLUNA owners could convert their holdings back into LUNA.

<p>Investors in UST invested in a common enterprise with other UST purchasers, as well as with Terraform and Kwon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants created, developed, updated and maintained profit-bearing opportunities for UST, including the yield-bearing “Anchor Protocol” to generate profits for UST purchasers.  Defendants’ Anchor Protocol pooled UST investor funds and lent them out to borrowers to generate returns for the investors.  Defendants’ Anchor Protocol also did not manage individual or separate accounts for investors.  If deployment of funds within the Anchor Protocol was successful in generating returns, all investors profited equally in proportion to their investment.  Accordingly, each investor’s fortune was tied to the fortunes of the other investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UST investors’ fortunes were also tied to Defendants’ fortunes.  Terraform and Kwon both deposited UST, sometimes in the millions or tens-of millions, respectively, into the Anchor Protocol.  Kwon tweeted in May 2021 that Terraform owned $59 million in UST, and Kwon consistently held in excess of 1 million UST, further showing that investors’ fortunes were tied to the fortunes of Defendants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That Defendants’ and investors’ fortunes were tied to each other and to the success of the Anchor Protocol was demonstrated when, in May 2022, the UST de-peg resulted in the collapse of the Terraform ecosystem and left the UST held by investors and Defendants nearly valueless.</p>

<ol class="arabic" start="74">
<li>
<p>Defendants led UST/Anchor Protocol investors to reasonably expect profits based on Defendants’ managerial efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As advertised by Defendants, to “earn” what Terraform advertised as nearly 20% annual returns via the Anchor Protocol, investors deposited their UST into a smart contract associated with the Anchor Protocol.  Just prior to the collapse of the Terraform ecosystem in early May 2022, over 70% of UST was deposited into the Anchor Protocol, meaning that investors deposited into the protocol close to 14 billion (or nearly 74 percent) of the almost 19 billion in overall UST.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants also engaged in efforts to engineer, develop, and support the Anchor Protocol, for the purpose of maintaining the promised returns to investors.  Defendants touted these efforts to investors in their monthly investor updates, including, among other things, their efforts building out its front-end user access and back-end features, facilitating user access to the protocol through third-parties’ crypto asset financial services, and funding and managing the Anchor Protocol “yield reserve,” which was used to pay investors interest on their UST.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specifically, when revenue from the Anchor Protocol was not sufficient to cover its advertised returns to UST depositors, Terraform and Kwon sought to ensure that the Anchor Protocol had enough reserve assets to pay investors the promised interest and continue attracting
UST/Anchor Protocol investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, in July 2021, Terraform provided approximately $70 million of UST to the Anchor Protocol yield reserve.  By early 2022, the yield reserve was quickly running out of money, and it again was topped up by the Luna Foundation Guard with another approximately $450 million of UST.  This replenishment was directed by Kwon, who at the time was the director of the Luna Foundation Guard.  At Kwon’s request and authorization, the Luna Foundation Guard directed some of its LUNA to the Anchor Protocol to be converted into UST and deposited into the yield reserve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants touted that returns to UST investors from the Anchor Protocol were derived from their efforts supporting the Anchor Protocol, highlighting in public statements and statements to groups of investors that Defendants’ work would support the Anchor Protocol and its yield rate.  For example, in January 2022, Kwon tweeted publicly about Defendants’ efforts to support the Anchor Protocol’s yield reserve:</p>

<li>
<p>Defendants also took drastic steps to maintain UST’s “peg” to the U.S. dollar, including by gifting the Luna Foundation Guard billions of dollars to buy UST in the event of the price of UST going below $1 and “defend the peg.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many domestic retail investors purchased UST for the sole purpose of earning a return on the Anchor Protocol developed and maintained by Defendants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These U.S. retail investors, all of whom lost nearly their entire UST investments in May 2022, lacked the technical expertise to generate returns with respect to their UST purchase for themselves.  They included a musician in Venice, California; a pharmacist in Cypress, California; a painter in Brattleboro, Vermont; an accountant in Stockton, California; an engineer in Knoxville, Tennessee; and an IT worker in Orange County, California.  Many lacked significant investment experience and educated themselves about UST and the Anchor Protocol via the Internet and social media.  They considered UST to be safe with an almost 20% yield when invested in the Anchor Protocol, as marketed by Terraform and Kwon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For much of the Relevant Period, UST and the Anchor Protocol appeared to meet investors’ expectations.  With the exception of a brief episode in May 2021 (discussed below), the price of UST remained pegged to the U.S. dollar until plummeting to under a penny and wiping out billions of dollars of investor money in May 2022.</p>

<p>After the launch of the Mirror Protocol, Terraform “farmed” MIR tokens to distribute to investors pursuant to agreements between investors and a wholly owned subsidiary of Terraform which were signed by Kwon.  Terraform farmed more MIR tokens than it was required to distribute, and retained or sold the excess tokens.  If the price of MIR increased (or decreased), both Defendants and investors would benefit (or suffer losses) in proportion to their holdings, thus tying the MIR investors’ fortunes to those of Defendants.</p>

<ol class="arabic" start="90">
<li>
<p>Defendants touted an investment in MIR as a way for investors to invest in the potential success of the Mirror Protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investors bought MIR with the expectation that the price of MIR would increase based on Defendants’ managerial efforts.  Defendants told investors that the price of the MIR was directly correlated with Terraform’s and Kwon’s efforts to increase the usage of the Mirror Protocol because its value was dependent on the fees generated by usage of the Mirror Protocol. In promotional materials provided to investors in September 2020, Terraform noted that
Defendants would heavily promote the Mirror Protocol, which would increase the price of the MIR tokens.  These materials also provided a revenue projections table that estimated the price of MIR based on how much the Mirror Protocol was used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants further held themselves out to the public as managing and working on the Mirror Protocol as part of their work to build out the Terraform ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consistent with their public touting, Defendants engaged in entrepreneurial and managerial efforts to make the Mirror Protocol a successful enterprise.  For example, they controlled websites related to the Mirror Protocol that promoted, explained, and facilitated its use for the general public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants, in fact, controlled many aspects of the Mirror Protocol and engaged in myriad efforts to facilitate and support its function. For example, Terraform engineered, launched, and upgraded versions of the Mirror Protocol.  In addition to employing engineers responsible for coding and substantially upgrading the Mirror Protocol, Terraform also employed a “product manager” for the Mirror Protocol.  Terraform further controlled a mechanism that provided a price check on the underlying assets for the mAssets for the purpose of facilitating the creation and liquidation of mAssets on the protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terraform and Kwon also promoted the Mirror Protocol through, among other means, Terraform’s website, web application, social media accounts, podcast interviews, and through U.S. media.  Kwon tweeted extensively prior to and after the release of the Mirror Protocol, noting Terraform’s continued participation and partnerships to help the project succeed.  Upon announcing the Mirror Protocol to the public in December 2020, Kwon tweeted
“Going forward, we look forward to being active contributors in the community to help @mirror_protocol succeed.”  Following the launch of the Mirror Protocol, Terraform and Kwon advertised it aggressively, including in blog posts, tweets and interviews.  In January 2021, a Mirror Community update on the Mirror Medium page stated, “We’re always working hard to improve Mirror and rely on our brilliant community for feedback and ideas.”  Terraform and Kwon also regularly emailed updates about Terraform’s work and development on the Terraform ecosystem, including to an email group with the recipient name of “mirror_investors.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terraform employees also engaged in public and extensive entrepreneurial and managerial efforts with respect to the Mirror Protocol, including by heavily promoting it and touting its growth in public presentations.  For example, in June 2021, Terraform’s U.S.-based Director of Special Projects provided a presentation to the “Defi Summit” on behalf of Terraform that included an extensive discussion of Terraform’s Mirror Protocol.  Among other things, Terraform’s Director of Special Projects stated that, not only was Terraform responsible for launching the Mirror Protocol, but “we’ve grown [the Mirror Protocol] to two billion [dollars] in total value locked and one million [dollars] in liquidity.”  He also discussed how “we just want to create a very delightful and magical experience . . . for users providing a Robinhood-like interface.”  Additionally, Terraform’s Business Development lead and its Head of Communications participated in an interview that publicized and explained the Mirror Protocol, noting that Terraform has a “team of [approximately] 40 people working full-time across Asia/US.”  The article explained that “Mirror is a synthetic assets protocol” and that Terraform planned to expand Mirror “beyond SE Asia and the typical US market.”</p>

<p><strong>mAsset Transactions Were Security-Based Swaps</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="97">
<li>
<p>Terraform’s Mirror Protocol permitted the creation of assets—called “mAssets”— that “mirrored” the price of securities.  The mAssets were created when, based on the smart contract coded into the Terraform blockchain, an investor provided a payment equal to 150% of the value of the security that the mAsset mirrored.  In return, the investor received an mAsset equal to the value of the security that the mAsset was designed to mirror, such as the stock of Apple, Inc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once an mAsset was created, if the price of the referenced security rose so that the collateral rate was no longer satisfied, the investor was required to deposit additional collateral based on the value of such increases or the investor’s collateral would be liquidated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The investor could terminate the transaction by making a final payment in the form of the mAsset (also called “burning” or returning the mAsset).  At the point of the termination of the transaction, the investor was entitled to receive payment back in the form of the entire collateral.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, an investor could create an “mAAPL” mAsset by making a payment equal to at least 150% of the value of Apple stock into a smart contract on the Mirror Protocol.  In return, the investor received “mAAPL.”  If the actual price of Apple stock rose in value, the investor was required to deposit additional payments such that the investor’s collateral equaled 150% of the now increased value of Apple, or else the collateral would be liquidated and a portion paid back to the investor.  The investor could terminate the transaction by paying the mAAPL back to the smart contract in the Mirror Protocol, at which point the investor was entitled to receive a payment back of all of the investor’s collateral.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each transaction offering or selling an mAsset thus constituted a security-based swap.  First, each transaction provided on an executory basis for an exchange of a payment, based on the value of a security.  That is, an investor provided a payment in the form of collateral equal to at least 150% of the value of the security (e.g., Apple stock) that the mAsset mirrored, in exchange for an mAsset (e.g., mAAPL).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, each transaction transferred, between the investor and the Mirror Protocol, the financial risk associated with a future change in the value of a security without also conveying a current or future direct or indirect ownership interest in the underlying security.  This is because the mAsset (e.g., “mAAPL”) tracked the rise or fall in price of the underlying security, (e.g., Apple stock), but did not convey any direct or indirect interest in the underlying security (i.e., the investor in mApple did not own any direct or indirect interest in Apple stock even though the value of her mApple tracked the change in value of Apple stock).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mAsset transactions were generally offered, sold, or effected through the Mirror Protocol (and not a registered national securities exchange) with or for persons who were not eligible contract participants, in violation of Securities Act Section 5(e) and Exchange Act Section 6(l).</p>

<p><strong>Defendants Offered and Sold Crypto Asset Securities in Unregistered Transactions</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="104">
<li>
<p>Beginning in 2018 and continuing until the collapse of the Terraform ecosystem in May 2022, Defendants engaged in capital fundraising activities through the unregistered offering and sales of the crypto asset securities described above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With respect to LUNA, the unregistered public offering included a pre-seed and seed round, a public initial sale, loans of LUNA for distribution into the market for resales, and
Terraform’s direct sales on crypto asset trading platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From at least April 2018 through September 2018, as part of one continuous offering, Terraform sold close to 200 million LUNA to institutional investors, including at least one U.S. entity, and offshore entities controlled by U.S. entities.  The terms of these sales imposed no restrictions on when those tokens could be resold by the investors.  Terraform distributed to some of the investors less than a year after the executed agreements, and Kwon signed the purchase agreements.  The terms of these agreements reflect the expectation that most, if not all, of these purchasers would sell their LUNA into public markets.  In other words, Defendants were essentially embarking on a large-scale unregistered public distribution of LUNA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Between January and late February 2019, Terraform also sold approximately $60,000 worth of LUNA in a worldwide sale that was advertised on Terraform’s publicly available messaging channels and through email.  The offering involved general solicitations into the United States.  Defendants also contracted with a company to make the LUNA available to investors worldwide online.  Investors in these sales were told by Defendants that they would receive the tokens for a discount on market prices three months after the token launch.  The LUNA tokens that Terraform and Kwon sold did not restrict purchaser resales into the United States or elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later that year, in November 2019, Terraform and its wholly owned subsidiary loaned 30 million LUNA to a U.S.-based proprietary trading firm (the “U.S. Trading Firm”).  Kwon emailed a small group of investors to inform them that the purpose of the transaction was to “improve liquidity” of LUNA, because of the “lackluster [ ] performance of the LUNA token.”  In July 2020, the U.S. Trading Firm began actively selling LUNA into the market, allowing public investors to purchase LUNA through transactions in secondary markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In September 2020, Terraform and its wholly owned subsidiary “loaned” an additional 65 million LUNA to the U.S. Trading Firm.  In order to receive the LUNA, the U.S. Trading Firm had to meet certain thresholds related to trading in UST.  It met the first threshold and began receiving LUNA pursuant to the loan from Terraform in January 2021.  The U.S. Trading Firm subsequently began continuously selling LUNA into the market, including through a major U.S. crypto asset trading platform once that platform began listing LUNA in August 2021.  Terraform’s “loan” to the U.S. Trading Firm and the U.S. Trading Firm’s subsequent sales thus allowed public investors, including those in the U.S., to acquire or transact in LUNA through transactions in the secondary market and generated speculative interest in LUNA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These two transactions between Terraform, its subsidiary, and the U.S. Trading Firm, which are described in more detail below, were, in essence, public distributions of LUNA by Terraform.  The U.S. Trading Firm acquired the LUNA from Terraform and its subsidiary and sold it into the market directly with Terraform’s knowledge and expressed intent that the LUNA provided would be so distributed in order to “improve liquidity.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the Relevant Period, LUNA was also made available for trading on multiple crypto asset trading platforms.  From at least August 2019, through at least February 2022, Terraform sold billions of dollars of LUNA directly into secondary markets through transactions on crypto asset trading platforms, including those available to U.S. investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to the launch of the Mirror Protocol, Terraform and Kwon raised over three million dollars by selling more than 37 million MIR tokens through agreements between investors and a wholly owned subsidiary of Terraform.  These agreements were signed by Kwon and entered into with at least six U.S. purchasers.  The contracts were signed in September of 2020, and the MIR tokens became available to these pre-launch purchasers by January or
February of 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terraform and Kwon sold these 37 million MIR tokens without restricting the resale of their tokens and did not take any steps to verify investors’ accredited status.  Although there is no indication of general solicitation, no exemptions to registration were available given the fact that tokens sold in this offering were available for resale on an unrestricted basis less than a year after the initial transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to selling MIR tokens pre-launch, Terraform also later sold them directly into the market through crypto asset trading platforms and made them available on the Terraform-controlled website for the Mirror Protocol that could be accessed in the U.S. Terraform entered into a listing agreement with at least one U.S. crypto asset trading platform for the listing of MIR tokens on the platform.  In addition, Terraform and Kwon “loaned” MIR tokens to market makers with no restrictions on resale, who then sold the loaned MIR upon receipt on U.S.-based crypto asset trading platforms and other crypto asset trading platforms that are available to U.S. investors. Again, the terms of these transactions reflect the expectation that these market makers would sell their MIR tokens into public markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning in late 2020, Terraform also created, offered, sold, and effected transactions in mAssets through the Mirror Protocol.  Terraform and Kwon offered and sold mAssets by (i) creating and maintaining the Mirror Protocol, (ii) promoting the investment opportunity in blog posts, tweets and interviews, and (iii) making them available for sale on Terraform-controlled websites or through crypto asset trading platforms.  For example, when a user navigated to the website with the domain name <a href="http://terra.mirror.finance/trade#buy" class="bare">http://terra.mirror.finance/trade#buy</a>, a website controlled by Terraform that was accessible to U.S. investors, the potential investor could choose to create, trade, or buy mAssets that mimicked the price of U.S. equity securities:</p>

<li>
<p>Terraform created, offered, sold, and effected transactions in mAssets through the Mirror Protocol to persons who were not eligible contract participants, and Defendants made no effort to determine whether potential or actual investors were eligible contract participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No registration statement has been filed or was in effect with respect to any of the offers and sales of crypto asset securities described above.  No exemption was available from registration under the Securities Act for any crypto asset securities offered or sold by Defendants.</p>

<p><strong>Terraform and Kwon Misled, Deceived, and Defrauded Investors</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="118">
<li>
<p>To inspire confidence in the Terraform ecosystem, and encourage trading in its crypto asset securities, Defendants engaged in a scheme to deceive and mislead investors and prospective investors in the U.S. and abroad.  In particular, from at least mid-2019 through at least March 2022, Defendants misled investors and prospective investors into believing that the Terraform blockchain was being used to process and settle real world purchases by retail consumers in Korea.  In addition, when UST de-pegged briefly from the U.S. dollar in May 2021, Defendants falsely represented that the peg was restored due to the success of UST’s algorithm, which, according to Terraform, was the “lynchpin of the entire [Terraform] ecosystem.”  Defendants misleadingly omitted the real reason for the re-peg – the deliberate intervention by a third party, as discussed with Defendants, to buy large amounts of UST to restore its value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants’ statements were materially false and misleading and made during a time when Defendants were actively offering, selling, and/or marketing Terraform’s crypto assets, including LUNA and UST.  Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that these representations were false when they were made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As one Terraform employee stated in a chat with another employee on September 1, 2021, “working at terra has reinforced my belief in conspiracy theories . . . just the white lies to prop up anchor and mirror and the illusion of decentralization and true extent of chai adoption . . . all from the armchair of a single man sipping whisky” – the reference to a man sipping whisky being Kwon.</p>

<p><strong>Terraform and Kwon Deceived Investors About Chai</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="121">
<li>
<p>Terraform and Kwon marketed the Terraform blockchain as having a real-world use.  Specifically, Terraform and Kwon repeatedly claimed that a Korean company, Chai Corporation (“Chai”), used the Terraform blockchain to process and settle millions of transactions for Korean consumers at retail establishments, such as online stores, movie theaters,and convenience stores.  These statements were materially false and misleading.  Chai transactions were neither processed nor settled on the Terraform blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To further deceive investors, Terraform and Kwon recorded completed Chai transactions onto the Terraform blockchain to make it appear as if they were processed on the blockchain when, in fact, they were not.  The purported “real-world use” of the Terraform blockchain was a literal fabrication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chai is a mobile payment service provider in Korea, similar to PayPal or Venmo, which Kwon launched, together with Terraform’s co-founder, in or around June 2019.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Until early 2020, Chai and Terraform were closely associated with each other, sharing an office space and overlapping personnel.  During that time, Kwon sat on Chai’s board of directors and was kept up to date on Chai activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometime in early 2020, Kwon and Terraform’s co-founder took steps to separate Terraform’s business from Chai.  Kwon took control of Terraform and moved its offices to a new location.  At the same time, the majority of Terraform’s employees began working solely for Terraform.  However, until approximately May 2022, Kwon continued to sit on Chai’s board and Defendants continued to represent publicly that Terraform was connected to Chai.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From mid-2019 through at least March 2022, Defendants made numerous and repeated statements falsely representing that the “backend” of Chai transactions were being processed and settled using the Terraform blockchain.  Terraform and Kwon also falsely stated that Chai’s use of the Terraform blockchain provided incentives to both Korean merchants and consumers to use Chai for their transactions.  Specifically, Terraform and Kwon claimed that Chai’s use of the Terraform blockchain meant that merchants experienced faster processing times and lower transaction fees through Chai than through competitor mobile payment services providers.  Likewise, Terraform and Kwon maintained that Chai customers would benefit from additional consumer discounts flowing from the lower costs associated with Chai’s purported use of the Terraform blockchain.  With these misrepresentations, Terraform and Kwon misleadingly used Chai’s growth as a proxy for the growth and success of the Terraform ecosystem as a whole.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terraform and Kwon made these false and misleading statements in presentations to solicit investments in Terraform’s crypto asset securities, including LUNA, from investors and prospective investors in the U.S. and overseas.  In addition, Terraform made and disseminated these false and misleading statements in public interviews, Terraform-sponsored podcasts, and social media posts, which were available to U.S. investors and prospective investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For instance, in a presentation aired on CNBC Africa that Terraform made available to U.S. investors when it posted it to YouTube on October 14, 2019, Kwon discussed Chai in depth, explaining:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">[I]n the backend, it uses Terra’s blockchain technology to solve some major pain points and problems for the merchants.<br/>
 &period; &period; &period;<br/>
But in the backend is where the real magic starts to happen. And I contend that Terra solves two of the biggest roadblocks to the adoption of digital payments in Asia and the rest of the world.  So the first is slow settlement periods.<br/>
 &period; &period; &period;<br/>
Terra settles in six seconds.  So every block for every transaction that has been made, we batch it up and then send it to the merchant so they can have easy and early access to working capital should they choose to do so.  The second problem that we solve is high transaction fees.<br/>
 &period; &period; &period;<br/>
So in the thirteen weeks in which we have been operational, early response has been quite explosive.  Up - up to today we have had 430,000 shoppers over the Chai gateway, and most of them coming in the last month. And we’ve processed nearly 2,000,000 transactions up to date.  And we think that this number will continue to grow.  In terms of daily active users, Terra and Chai has already surpassed some of the most popular tokens.  Our daily active user numbers today currently stand at around 58,000 users. . .<br/>
 &period; &period; &period;<br/>
So, basically what we are going for is to facilitate everyday retail transactions that are powered by Terra.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="129">
<li>
<p>In an email sent on February 6, 2020 directly to investors, including U.S.-based institutional investors, Kwon noted that “Chai sits at 1.18 million active accounts today, and we passed the 1M mark on Jan 14th.”  Similarly, on February 9, 2020, Kwon wrote in the Terra General Discord Channel chat accessible to the public that “[r]ight now Chai has 12 merchants, all of whom get settled in KRT on the Terraform blockchain.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terraform provided a September 2020 investor slide deck to at least one U.S.based institutional investor, in which it touted the purported speed and efficiency of Chai in using the Terraform blockchain to process transactions.  One slide titled “Explosive adoption of payment solutions has generated Terra 16M in annualized fees” contained a chart of various crypto assets and associated that $16 million with “LUNA, Terra’s Native Token.”  Later slides in the deck also touted Chai’s success in promoting the investment opportunities of other Terraform crypto asset securities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a series of Tweets posted on May 24, 2021 through @terra_money, Terraform again emphasized Chai’s use of the Terraform blockchain and highlighted its growth, stating: <br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">17/ As long as we create useful applications that people use on top of Terra, the strong locus of demand will always exist.<br/>
18/ And the use cases are already there. CHAI has more than 2 million active users in Korea.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And on March 31, 2022, in an interview posted to the public YouTube channel Blockworks Macro, Kwon again touted Chai and its use of the Terraform blockchain:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">So, we&#8217;ve launched apps like Chai in Korea. And so, the idea was that we were close to retail loop with things that people can buy, and transact with using, you know, Terra payments. So, you could take it to most e-commerce merchants of your choice. I could go to movie theaters, convenience stores, and things like that.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to making and disseminating these materially false and misleading statements, Terraform and Kwon engaged in other deceptive acts, including by entering transactions on the Terraform blockchain using “KRT” (yet another algorithmic stablecoin offered by Terraform that was pegged to Korean currency, Won), which purported to reflect Chai commercial transactions.  Specifically, from June 2019 through at least May 12, 2022, the Terraform blockchain appeared to reflect that Chai transactions were being settled on the blockchain in KRT, when, in fact, Chai payments were processed in Korean Won.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To carry out this deception, Terraform programmed a server, which was referred to internally as the “LP Server,” to receive and process data about Chai transactions, and then issue instructions to the Terraform blockchain to replicate those transactions as if they had originally “settled” on the Terraform blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analysis of Terraform blockchain data reflects that, in replicating the Chai transactions, Terraform used one wallet address (“Terraform Master Wallet”) to fund up to 2.7 million other wallets.  Terraform controlled each of these wallets and used them to execute batched or “multisend” transfers that would replicate multiple Chai transactions together in a single transaction, using data received by the LP Server.  Analysis of Terraform blockchain data further reflects that Terraform used the Terraform Master Wallet to begin each batch of transactions that replicated the real transactions that Chai was processing in Korean Won.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In statements to investors, Kwon has confirmed that the batched blockchain transactions that utilized this Terraform Master Wallet were purportedly connected to Chai (though he did not disclose that they merely replicated Chai transactions, which were not actually settled on the blockchain).  For instance, in a private Discord chat on June 22, 2019, Kwon told a small number of investors that Terraform blockchain transactions that are “multisend [are] pretty much all Chai.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To further his deception, Kwon “challenged” his Twitter followers to identify purported merchant wallet addresses from these replicated blockchain transactions.  Specifically, in a February 8, 2020 tweet posted through @stablekwon, Kwon challenged his followers to identify Chai merchant wallet addresses from the blockchain, posting:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">Fun thought: currently @terra_money payments app Chai is linked with 12 merchants in Korea.  Can anyone guess which wallet address belongs to which merchant?  First person to respond with the correct guess and explain reasoning get 5000 $LUNA.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least one of Kwon’s Twitter followers purportedly accepted the challenge and searched the Terraform blockchain to match the follower’s real-world Chai app payments with transactions recorded on the blockchain.  As a result, the follower claimed to have discovered eleven of the twelve purported merchant wallet addresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On February 9, 2020, Kwon posted a follow-up tweet falsely stating that the follower had correctly identified the Chai merchant wallets.  In fact, a blockchain analysis reveals that each identified transaction began with the Terraform Master Wallet and the purportedly identified merchant wallet addresses were controlled by Terraform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These Terraform blockchain transactions purporting to represent real Chai transactions were purely sham transactions.  An analysis of the blockchain indicates that virtually all the KRT used to fund the Terraform Master Wallet originated from other Terraform-controlled wallets, including a reserve of Terraform stablecoins, called Terraform SDR (SDT).  Similarly, virtually all the KRT used to replicate these Chai transactions remained in or was returned to Terraform-controlled wallets through at least May 12, 2022.  The analysis further reflects that, from June 2019 until at least May 2022, with very few exceptions, the wallet addresses used in Terraform Master Wallet transactions were used in no other transactions other than those initiated from the Terraform Master Wallet.  In other words, these blockchain transactions do not reflect real-world, arms-length transfers of KRT between consumers and merchants.  Instead, they reflect a closed system in which Terraform transferred KRT between millions of wallets that it controlled in order to replicate millions of transactions processed through Chai to make it appear that they had been processed and settled on the Terraform blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In reality, Chai did not process or settle transactions on the Terraform blockchain, but instead used traditional payment methods of receiving Korean Won from its customers and paying Korean Won to participating merchants.  Neither Chai consumers nor Chai merchants were transacting in KRT.  The transactions that were executed by the LP Server on the Terraform blockchain merely recorded transactions that had already happened in the real world using Korean Won.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breaks in the continuity of new blocks created on the Terraform blockchain confirm that no Chai transactions occurred on the blockchain.  The Terraform blockchain typically creates new blocks reflecting new states of the blockchain (including transactions) every six or so seconds.  However, in at least five instances between October 2021 and March 2022, there were one or more days when no transactions whatsoever were confirmed on the Terraform blockchain.  Yet, there is no evidence that the Chai payment application was not functioning during those periods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chai itself has denied in emails to its own investors that it used a blockchain to process its payments and claimed that doing so would not have been legally permitted in Korea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terraform employees that knew of the deception also knew to maintain its secrecy.  For example, one Terraform employee explained in a chat with another employee on October 9, 2021, “btw we don’t want to say stuff about LP server too much . . . it breaks the perception that chai depends on Terra . . . Basically chai doesn’t need Terra to work . . . It’s what copies chai’s transactions from their data base to create tx activity.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a founder and former director of Chai, Kwon (and through Kwon, Terraform) knew or were reckless in not knowing that Chai did not actually process or settle transactions on the Terraform blockchain.  Kwon personally wrote much of the Terraform blockchain code from its genesis through two version upgrades and was primarily responsible for Terraform’s coding and engineering strategy decisions.  At the time of Chai’s development and launch, Kwon held the most senior technical position at Terraform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kwon knew or was reckless in not knowing that the LP Server was merely replicating Chai transaction data that had not actually occurred on the Terraform blockchain because Kwon directly supervised and instructed the Terraform employees who programmed the LP Server in the first instance.  Kwon also participated in technical discussions that required an understanding of how Chai transactions were reflected on the Terraform blockchain, including that they were batched in “multisend” transactions, and demonstrated knowledge of the location of Chai-related files in Terraform’s code repositories.  Kwon further demonstrated his understanding of the Chai transaction replication process by publicly confirming Terraform blockchain wallet addresses that purportedly belonged to Chai merchants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants’ misleading statements and omissions, and their deceptive acts, with respect to the non-existent Chai transactions, were material to investors in Terraform’s crypto assets securities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terraform and Kwon used these material misrepresentations about Chai to encourage and solicit investments by retail and institutional investors in Terraform crypto assets, including LUNA and wLUNA.  For example, in a June 19, 2020 blog post on Terraform’s Medium website, Terraform’s Head of Ecosystem Development directly tied Chai’s purported use of the Terraform blockchain to the returns to Terraform investors, writing: <br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">In this piece we’d like to go beyond the numbers to reflect on the key role that transaction fees play in determining network value and security. The fundamental driver of transaction fees in the Terra network is the broad adoption of CHAI by consumers and merchants.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants’ efforts worked.  U.S.-based retail and institutional investors believed that Chai operated on the Terraform blockchain and found it significant in deciding to invest in Terraform crypto assets, including LUNA.  For example, on December 3, 2020, the CEO of a U.S. based institutional investor posted to Twitter: “Terra’s payment app Chai is up to 80k daily active users.  Koreans are fast adopters.  Watch this grow. $LUNA.”  On May 18, 2022, that same CEO posted a memo to Twitter purporting to explain the basis for investing in LUNA.  In the memo, the CEO highlighted as one significant factor, Chai’s use of the Terra blockchain, describing it as “crypto finding a real-world use case.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, in or around November 2021, Kwon and another Terraform employee approached another U.S.-based institutional investor to solicit that investor to purchase LUNA tokens.  In pitching the LUNA investment, Terraform and Kwon told the investor that the Terraform blockchain was being used to process Chai transactions.  The investor found this fact to be significant in deciding to invest with Terraform.  This investor specifically highlighted Chai’s purported transactions on the Terraform blockchain in the investor’s internal investment memorandum in early January 2022.  On or about January 24, 2022, that investor (through a foreign subsidiary) signed an agreement to purchase $57 million in LUNA tokens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From December 27, 2019, to March 10, 2022, U.S.-based institutional investors (either directly or through offshore affiliates) purchased approximately $656 million of LUNA tokens from Terraform (or a wholly-controlled subsidiary).  These institutional investors included hedge funds and venture capitalists based in California, New York, Massachusetts, Florida, and Washington D.C.  Similarly, from September 2021 through May 2022, retail investors, including investors in the U.S., purchased billions of dollars of LUNA and wLUNA on crypto asset trading platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Terraform and Kwon Mislead Investors about the May 2021 De-peg</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="152">
<li>
<p>Terraform and Kwon also engaged in a scheme to mislead investors and potential investors about the stability of Terraform’s stablecoin “UST” (including as offered and sold with the Anchor Protocol) and the algorithm that purportedly pegged UST’s price to the U.S. dollar.  Specifically, in May 2021, when the value of UST became “unpegged” from the U.S. dollar, Terraform, through Kwon, secretly discussed plans with a third party, the “U.S. Trading Firm,” to buy large amounts of UST to restore its value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When UST’s price went back up as a result of these efforts, Defendants falsely and misleadingly represented to the public that UST’s algorithm had successfully re-pegged UST to the dollar, giving the investing public the false and misleading impression that the re-peg had occurred without human intervention and misleadingly omitting the real reason for the re-peg:  intervention by the U.S. Trading Firm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting on or about November 2019, the U.S. Trading Firm and Terraform or its subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements (negotiated and signed by Kwon on behalf of Terraform), whereby the U.S. Trading Firm was to provide Terraform market-making services with respect to LUNA, and eventually UST, in exchange for compensation (generally by receiving LUNA at a significant discount to market prices).  These agreements generally provided for the U.S. Trading Firm to receive LUNA after achieving certain benchmarks in its trading of UST.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From 2019, when UST was first coded onto the Terraform blockchain, until mid-May 2021, there were no significant market disruptions to UST.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But on May 19, 2021, UST began to de-peg from $1.00.  On May 23, 2021, UST’s price declined sharply, dropping to nearly $0.90.  That morning and continuing throughout the day, Kwon communicated repeatedly with the U.S. Trading Firm.  In these communications, Kwon expressed concern over UST’s value and discussed with the U.S. Trading Firm how to restore UST’s peg to the dollar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The U.S. Trading Firm responded by purchasing large quantities of UST throughout the day on May 23 and continuing through May 27 in an effort to restore the peg.  Ultimately, the U.S. Trading Firm made net purchases of over 62 million UST across at least two crypto asset trading platforms.  As depicted in the chart below, UST’s market price began to rise shortly after the U.S. Trading Firm’s purchases, and eventually was restored to near $1.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</div>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="158">
<li>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Kwon on behalf of Terraform agreed to remove the loan agreement conditions that required the U.S. Trading Firm to achieve the requisite benchmarks in order to receive the loaned LUNA tokens.  Instead, Terraform agreed to deliver on specified dates, without conditions, specific amounts of the remaining 61,458,334 LUNA tokens to the U.S. Trading Firm under the agreements.  Under the modified terms of the agreements, the final LUNA delivery to the U.S. Trading Firm was set to occur by September 1, 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those modifications were subsequently reduced to writing in a July 21, 2021 agreement signed by Kwon.  Under the terms of the modified agreement, U.S. Trading Firm received LUNA tokens at $0.40 per token, even during periods when LUNA was trading at more than $90 in the secondary market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The U.S. Trading Firm ultimately profited approximately $1.28 billion by selling LUNA acquired from Terraform under the terms of the 2019 and 2020 loan agreements, as modified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost immediately upon UST’s recovery in May 2021, Terraform and Kwon began to make materially misleading statements about how UST’s peg to the dollar was restored.  Specifically, Terraform and Kwon emphasized the purported effectiveness of the algorithm underlying UST in maintaining UST pegged to the dollar – misleadingly omitting the true cause of UST’s re-peg: the deliberate intervention by the U.S. Trading Firm to restore the peg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For instance, in May 23, 2021, Kwon posted a series of statements on his Twitter account @d0h0k1, including:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock">16/ Is $UST growth manipulated by Terraform Labs? Nobody who’s used mirror or anchor could believe this – but just for clarification we currently hold only ~59M $UST.<br/>
Reminder that there’s currently over 2B in UST stablecoins.<br/>
&period; &period; &period; <br/>
Building pure, unbiased and decentralized money is the long game. . .</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, on May 24, 2021, Terraform tweeted the following from @terra_money:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock">Plagued by the cumbersome nature of stress-induced decision-making of human agents in time of market volatility, it’s why central banks are exploring CBDCs.  Algorithmic, calibrated adjustments of economic parameters are more effective than faxes and suits in meetings.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kwon continued to make similar material misstatements over the course of the next year.  For instance, during a March 1, 2022 Twitter talk show, Kwon talked about UST’s de-peg in May 2021, stating:  <br/>
<span class="quoteblock">… it took a few days for the slippage cost to naturally heal back to spot. So that’s another feature of the market module where when the exchange rate has deviated from the peg, the protocol automatically self-heals the exchange rate back to whatever the spot price is being quoted by the oracle.  So that’s why it took several days for the peg to recover.</span><br/>
A transcript of that talk show was also posted to a publicly available website located at terraspaces.org, which was funded by Kwon.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="165">
<li>
<p>These statements were materially false and misleading.  Despite Defendants’ statements to the contrary, UST did not “automatically self-heal[].”  UST’s  “[a]lgorithmic, calibrated adjustments of economic parameters” failed.  UST’s peg to the dollar was not restored until after Defendants took deliberate steps to discuss with the U.S. Trading Firm a plan to deploy capital to restore UST’s price to one dollar.  While Defendants led investors to believe UST’s peg was restored by the algorithm, in fact, as Defendants knew, it was the deliberate actions of “human agents,” including Terraform, Kwon, and the U.S. Trading Firm, that ultimately led to the restoration of the peg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And Terraform and Kwon knew or were reckless in not knowing that these statements were materially false and misleading.  Terraform and Kwon knew that the U.S. Trading Firm had intervened to buy up UST because Terraform and Kwon discussed it with the U.S. Trading Firm at the time.  In fact, the U.S. Trading Firm was rewarded for its role in restoring the peg by having the terms of its loan agreements modified to the U.S. Trading Firm’s benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants never disclosed their or U.S. Trading Firm’s roles in restoring UST’s peg.  Instead, they misled investors who were actively buying and trading UST to believe that the algorithm had “self-heal[ed]” to restore the peg without any human involvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terraform and Kwon’s misrepresentations and omissions about the May 2021 depeg were material to numerous U.S.-based retail and institutional investors who were unaware that any third party had intervened to restore the peg and continued to buy and hold UST (including as offered and sold with Anchor Protocol) on the belief that the algorithm had worked to restore the peg.</p>

<p><strong>May 2022 Collapse of the Terraform Ecosystem</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="169">
<li>
<p>In May 2022, UST de-pegged from the U.S. dollar again.  This time UST’s price did not recover.  Several factors contributed to the crash, including the sale of large amounts of UST by one or more sophisticated trading firms beginning on or about May 7, 2022.  The algorithm failed to maintain the peg for UST, and its price fell to near zero, as did the prices of Terraform’s other crypto assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the end of May 2022, UST, LUNA, wLUNA and MIR were essentially worthless, wiping out more than $40 billion in combined market value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Domestic institutional investors experienced billions of dollars in losses in market valuations.  Countless retail investors lost their life savings and ended up in debt as a result of the collapse.  For example, a pharmacist in California borrowed $400,000 against the value of his home to purchase UST and lost his entire investment.  A painter in Vermont invested $20,000 in UST set aside for his son’s college education, but lost it all when the Terraform ecosystem collapsed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants still retain valuable proceeds from the Terraform ecosystem.  Specifically, Defendants transferred over 10,000 Bitcoin from Terraform and Luna Foundation Guard crypto asset platform accounts to an un-hosted wallet, or “cold” wallet (i.e., a self-custody wallet that is not on any exchange).  On a periodic basis since May 2022, Terraform and Kwon have transferred – and continue to transfer – Bitcoin from this wallet to a financial institution based in Switzerland and have converted the Bitcoin to cash.  Between June 2022 and the date of this complaint, over $100 million in fiat currency has been withdrawn from that Swiss bank.</p>
