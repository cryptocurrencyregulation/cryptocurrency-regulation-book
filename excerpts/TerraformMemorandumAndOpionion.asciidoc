[underline]#OPINION AND ORDER#
|===
JED S. RAKOFF, U.S.D.J.:

[.text-justify]
In this case, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) alleges that the defendants -- Terraform Labs Pte. Ltd., a “cryptoassets” company, and its founder, Do Hyeong Kwon –- orchestrated a multi-billion-dollar fraud involving the development, marketing, and sale of various cryptocurrencies. The SEC’s claims, all brought under the federal securities laws, include a claim that defendants offered and sold unregistered securities, claims that defendants offered and effected transactions in unregistered security-based swaps, and claims that defendants engaged in fraudulent schemes to lead investors astray. One of the alleged fraudulent schemes is that defendants misrepresented that one of Terraform’s crypto asset securities, UST, was permanently pegged to a $1.00 price through an automatic self-stabilizing algorithm, rather than through the intervention of a third-party trading firm with whom defendants struck a secret deal. Another of the alleged fraudulent schemes is that  defendants falsely stated that a Korean mobile payment application, Chai, used the Terraform blockchain to process and settle transactions in cryptocurrencies, a lie that defendants concealed by replicating purported Chai transactions on a Terraform server.
[.text-justify]
In support of its fraud claims, the SEC offers two expert witnesses: Dr. Bruce Mizrach and Dr. Matthew Edman. In response, defendants offer three expert witnesses of their own: Dr. Terrence Hendershott (as rebuttal to Dr. Mizrach), Mr. Raj Unny (as rebuttal to Dr. Edman), and Dr. Christine Parlour. Each side moved under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 to exclude the other side’s experts, and the Court, after receiving full briefing, held a “[underline]#Daubert#” hearing on those motions on November 17, 2023, at which it questioned all five putative experts. On November 20, 2023, the Court issued a “bottom-line” order denying defendants’ motions to exclude the testimony of Dr. Mizrach and Dr. Edman, denying the SEC’s motion to exclude the testimony of Dr. Hendershott, and granting the SEC’s motions to exclude the testimony of Mr. Unny and Dr. Parlour. Below, the Court explains the reasons for those rulings.
[.text-justify]
In addition, this Opinion and Order disposes of the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment, on which the Court received full briefing and held oral argument on November 30, 2023. As the Court explains below, the Court grants summary judgment for the SEC on the claim that defendants offered and sold unregistered securities. The Court grants summary judgment for defendants on the claims involving offering and effecting transactions in security-based swaps. Finally, the Court denies’ both sides’ cross-motions for summary judgment on the fraud claims.


&emsp;I&period;&emsp;&emsp; [underline]#Factual and Procedural Background#

[.text-justify]
Defendant Do Hyeong Kwon, along with an individual named Daniel Shin, founded Terraform Labs Pte. Ltd. (“Terraform”) in April 2018. ECF No. 124 (“Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1”), at ¶¶ 1-2.^*(xref:terraform_memorandum_and_opinion_fn_1[1])*^ In April 2019, Terraform and Kwon launched and promoted the Terraform blockchain, which would record and display transactions of cryptocurrency tokens, or crypto assets, across computers in a linked network. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 25; ECF No. 126 (“SEC Resp. to Defs.’ 56.1”), at ¶¶ 10-13.

&emsp;&emsp;A&period;&emsp; [underline]#LUNA and wLUNA#

[.text-justify]
Terraform coded into the blockchain at launch one billion tokens of a particular crypto asset, LUNA, that it created.^*(xref:terraform_memorandum_and_opinion_fn_2[2])*^ Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶ 25. Beginning even before the blockchain was developed, Terraform entered agreements to sell LUNA to buyers in exchange for both fiat currency and other crypto assets, such
as Bitcoin. [underline]#Id.# ¶¶ 51, 117; [underline]#e.g.#, ECF No. 73, Ex. 26 (July 11, 2018 token sale agreement for an institutional investor to purchase LUNA tokens from Terraform for $3,000,000 worth of Bitcoin). The terms of those agreements referred to an “Initial Token Launch,” which was defined as “the online sale and/or distribution of Tokens by the Vendor [Terraform or its subsidiary Terraform BVI] to the general public in a campaign to be initiated and conducted by the Vendor.” Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶ 118.
[.text-justify]
The agreements further contemplated that “Terraform would undertake efforts to generate a secondary trading  market for the LUNA tokens.” [underline]#Id.# The terms of the sales provided incentives for the purchasers to resell LUNA tokens by, for example, setting the purchase price at discounts of 40% or more from expected market prices. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 119. In a fundraising update in December 2018, Terraform co-founder Daniel Shin wrote that Terraform had “begun exchange listing discussions given token listing is a precondition for Terra/Luna ecosystem to operate.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 121. Terraform used proceeds from selling LUNA to, in part, fund Terraform’s operating costs. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 56.
[.text-justify]
In November 2019 and September 2020, Kwon negotiated and signed, on behalf of Terraform, agreements with a U.S. crypto asset trading firm, Jump Crypto Holdings LLC (“Jump”), to receive loans of 30 million and 65 million LUNA tokens, respectively. [underline]#Id.# ¶¶ 124, 130. In a January 13, 2020 email to “Terra’s leading investor
group,” Kwon announced that Terraform had “agreed to enter a partnership with Jump,” in which Jump would “deploy its own resources to improve liquidity of Terra and Luna.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 126. Kwon stated that, until then, LUNA’s liquidity had been “rather lackluster partly due to our team’s inexperience with secondary markets & trading operations.” [underline]#Id.# Kwon further explained that Terraform’s loan of LUNA tokens to Jump was “with the expectation that they are going to fill bids and offers to improve liquidity of LUNA in secondary trading markets.” [underline]#Id.# Moreover, Kwon acknowledged that Jump later provided periodic reports to
Terraform of its trading on various crypto asset trading platforms. [underline]#Id.# The second loan agreement, in September 2020, came about because a Jump executive emailed Kwon a proposal to obtain tens of millions of additional LUNA tokens at a discounted price to “thicken up LUNA markets further.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 129. 
[.text-justify]
In a Tweet on April 7, 2021, Kwon wrote: “A bet on the moon [LUNA] is very simple: it goes up in value (inc. scarcity) the more Terra money is used; it goes down in value (inc. dilution) the less Terra money is used. The moon’s fate in the long run is tied to how widely the money gets used and transacted.” ECF No. 75, Ex. 105. In another post that day, Kwon wrote: “But in the long run, $Luna value is actionable –- it grows as the [Terraform]ecosystem grows. As a holder of the [moon], you then have three choices: Sit back and watch me kick ass; Take profits and buy unvaluable assets; Or you can roll up your sleeves and build cool shit.” [underline]#Id.#, Ex. 108. Around the same time, SJ Park, Director of Special Projects at Terraform, stated in a videotaped presentation that “[o]wning LUNA is essentially owning a stake in the network and a bet that value will continue to accrue over time.” Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶ 63. In a public interview, Jeff Kuan, business development lead at Terraform, explained that “VCs investing in Terra means they’re buying LUNA, which is the ‘equity’ in our co.” [underline]#Id.# The price of LUNA increased from under $1.00 in January 2021 to a high of over $119 in April 2022, before plummeting to under a penny in May 2022. ECF No. 175, Ex. 125. 

&emsp;&emsp;B&period;&emsp; [underline]#UST and the Anchor Protocol#
[.text-justify]
In December 2019, Terraform created another crypto asset called UST, which it described as a “stablecoin” whose value was permanently and algorithmically pegged to one U.S. dollar. Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶¶ 21–24. As part of the algorithm, one UST could always be exchanged for $1 worth of LUNA, and $1 worth of LUNA could always be exchanged for one UST. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 23. In March 2021, Terraform launched “the Anchor Protocol,” which it described as a key component of “the Terra money market,” allowing UST holders to earn interest payments by depositing their tokens in a shared pool from which others could borrow UST. ECF No. 73, Ex. 44 at 2; [underline]#Id.#, Ex. 67. Terraform publicly announced, in a Tweet by Kwon, that “Anchor will target 20% fixed APR,” which was “by far the highest stablecoin yield in the market.” [underline]#Id.#, Ex. 66. A June 2020 white paper described the Anchor Protocol as “an attempt to give the main street investor a single, reliable, rate of return across all blockchains.” [underline]#Id.#, Ex. 44 at 2. 
[.text-justify]
Returns from the Anchor Protocol were paid out in proportion to the amount of UST a person or entity had deposited. Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶ 80. The Anchor Protocol website stated that “[d]eposited stablecoins are pooled and lent out to borrowers, with accrued interest pro-rata distributed to all depositors.” [underline]#Id.# By May 2022, there were approximately 18.5 billion tokens of UST, 14 billion of which had been deposited in the Anchor Protocol. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 36.

&emsp;&emsp;C&period;&emsp; [underline]#MIR, the Mirror Protocol, and mAssets#
[.text-justify]
In December 2020, Terraform launched “the Mirror Protocol.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 38. The Mirror Protocol allowed users to obtain “mAssets” -- tokens whose value would “mirror” the price of a pre-existing non-crypto asset, such as a publicly traded security. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 39. A Mirror Protocol user could mint an mAsset by depositing collateral of 150% or more of the value of the underlying security (the “reference stock”). [underline]#Id.# ¶ 113. The holder of the mAsset would thus hold the value of the deposit without holding the underlying reference stock or its attendant ownership interests. There was a catch, however. Whenever the price of the underlying reference stock rose above the holder’s initial buy-in, the holder would need to deposit additional collateral to maintain the mAsset. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 114. In other words, there is no evidence that suggests, and the SEC does not contend, that an mAsset would lead to profit for its holders or that any holders expected as much.
[.text-justify]
The same was not true, however, for the Mirror Protocol’s governance token, MIR. MIR’s value was based on the Mirror Protocol’s usage. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 38. A Terraform subsidiary sold MIR tokens directly to purchasers through “Simple Agreements for Farmed Tokens,” or SAFTs. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 135. Those agreements did not restrict purchasers from reselling their MIR tokens in secondary trading markets or to U.S. investors. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 136. Terraform also loaned as many as 4 million MIR tokens to Jump, in an agreement that expressly required Jump to trade MIR tokens on crypto asset trading platforms and to provide Terraform with reports of its trading. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 138. Terraform also sold LUNA and MIR tokens to secondary market purchasers on Binance and other crypto trading exchanges. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 142. The record provides no evidence that Terraform took steps to determine whether those trading platforms were available to U.S. investors. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 143.
[.text-justify]
In September 2020, Kwon emailed promotional materials to a potential purchaser, including a set of slides that described MIR as “a farmable governance token that earns fees from asset trades.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 101. Another slide proclaimed that the “Mirror token will accrue value from network fees and governance” and stated that MIR token holders could receive “trading fee revenues.” [underline]#Id.# Kwon even included in those materials a spreadsheet with a revenue projection table, estimating how the price of MIR would increase in tandem with greater usage of the Mirror Protocol. [underline]#Id.#; ECF No. 75, Ex. 148. In a June 2021 presentation, SJ Park, Terraform’s Director of Special Projects, stated that the Mirror Protocol had “grown to two billion [dollars] in total value locked and a billion [dollars] in liquidity.” Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶ 110.

&emsp;&emsp;D&period;&emsp; [underline]#Chai’s Use of the Terraform Blockchain#
[.text-justify]
In mid-2019, Terraform’s co-founder Daniel Shin developed Chai, a Korean mobile payment application. [underline]#Id.# ¶¶ 150-51. Terraform and Chai were closely associated until early 2020, including sharing office space and overlapping personnel. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 153. In a July 26, 2019 Terraform “Community Update,” Kwon wrote that “Chai launched using the Terra Protocol, and . . . already it is one of the most heavily used blockchain applications in existence.”[underline]#Id.# ¶ 168. In a February 9, 2020 Terraform chat message available to the public, Kwon stated that “Chai has 12 merchants, all of whom get settled in KRT [a crypto asset pegged to the Korean fiat currency, the won] on the Terraform blockchain.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 173. In an April 16, 2021 interview, Kwon stated that by paying “merchants directly in stablecoin, we’re able to cut down settlement times from seven days to six seconds, which [is] the average block time of the entire blockchain.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 181. In another public interview, on March 31, 2022, Kwon added that “the idea was that we could, you know, bootstrap a large network of merchants and users that are willing to transact using Terra.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 182.
[.text-justify]
According to the SEC, however, the above statements were misrepresentations because Chai never used the Terraform
blockchain to process transactions. In a May 26, 2020 email, a Chai employee explained that Chai would “process transaction[s] outside [the] blockchain” and then “write a record on the Terra blockchain in parallel.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 185. In a May 9, 2019 message, Kwon told Shin that he would “do fake transactions on the mainnet to generate staking returns of SDT,” another Terraform crypto asset. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 187. Kwon added, “[I] can just create fake transactions that look real which will generate fees and we can wind down as chai grows.” [underline]#Id.# When asked by Shin whether people would learn that the transactions were fake, Kwon responded, “All power to those that can prove it[’]s fake because I will try my best to make it indiscernable.”[underline]#Id.#
[.text-justify]
Shortly thereafter, Terraform developed what became known as the “LP Server.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 188. On October 9, 2020, a Terraform engineer messaged another Terraform employee, Paul Kim, to ask, “can you quickly explain me what’s the role of the lp-server?”[underline]#Id.# ¶ 200. Kim responded, “lp-server creates multisend  transactions by receiving transaction information from Chai,” adding, “[i]n short: it basically replicates chai transactions.” [underline]#Id.# Jihoon Kim, a former Terraform employee who had left to join Chai as lead engineer for its e-wallet and card business, told Chai’s Chief Product Officer –- an SEC whistleblower in this case -- that “there’s no crypto going on within Chai.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 186. When that whistleblower confronted Kwon in September 2021 about the fact that Chai did not really use the Terraform blockchain, Kwon did not deny the allegation but stated merely that he did not “give a fuck about Chai.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 183.

&emsp;&emsp;E&period;&emsp; [underline]#UST’s May 2021 Depeg#
[.text-justify]
On May 19, 2021, UST’s price fell below $1. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 209. On May 23, 2021, it dropped to around $0.90. [underline]#Id.# That same day, Kwon had multiple communications with a Jump executive. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 210. When asked about those communications at a deposition, that Jump executive –- as well as another -- invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 211. The SEC asserts that Terraform reached a deal with Jump to take action to restore UST’s $1 peg, and that, in return, Jump would no longer be required to achieve vesting conditions to receive additional LUNA tokens under earlier agreements. [underline]#Id.# On the day in question, May 23, 2021, a different Jump executive told employees, “I spoke to Do [Kwon] and he’s going to vest us.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 214. The same day, Kwon told Terraform’s head of business development that he was “speaking to jump about a solution.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 217. Terraform’s head of communications, Brian Curran, took notes at a division head meeting that day, writing that Kwon announced that the “[p]eg had to be defended”  and that “Jump was deploying $100 million to buyback UST.” [underline]#Id.# ¶¶ 217-18. Indeed, Jump purchased large amounts of UST in bursts that day, and UST’s market price was eventually restored to near $1.00. [underline]#Id.# ¶¶ 214-15. Later that year, Kwon told Curran that if Jump had not stepped in, Terraform “actually might’ve been fucked.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 219. Another Terraform employee added that “they [Jump] saved our ass.” [underline]#Id.#
[.text-justify]
On May 24, 2021, after UST’s price had largely recovered, Terraform published dozens of Tweets describing the benefits of “algorithmic, calibrated adjustments of economic parameters” as compared to the “stress-induced decision-making of human agents in [a] time of market volatility.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 222. Terraform referred to UST’s $1 peg as the “lynchpin for the entire [Terra] ecosystem” and described the depeg and repeg as a “black swan” event that was “as intense of a stress test in live conditions as can ever be expected.” [underline]#Id.# In a June 2021 Terraform Community Update, Terraform stated that “[i]ndustry-wide volatility stress-tested the stability mechanism of the Terra protocol.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 223. 
[.text-justify]
Kwon discussed the depeg again in a May 2022 talk show appearance, at which he pronounced that the UST algorithmic “protocol automatically self-heals the exchanged rate” and that “it took a few days for the slippage cost to naturally heal back to spot.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 224. Later that same month, however, Terraform’s crypto assets lost nearly all of their value –- according to the SEC, more than $45 billion -- and have not recovered. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 49.

&emsp;&emsp;E&period;&emsp; [underline]#Procedural History#
[.text-justify]
The SEC filed this action against Terraform and Kwon on February 16, 2023 and filed an Amended Complaint on April 3, 2023. [underline]#See# ECF Nos. 1, 25. The Amended Complaint contains six claims for relief: fraud in the offer or sale of securities in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act (Count I); fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities in violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and accompanying Rule 10b-5 (Count II); control person liability against Kwon under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, for the Section 10(b) violation (Count III); offering and selling unregistered securities in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act (Count IV); offering unregistered security-based swaps to non-eligible contract participants in violation of Section 5(e) of the Securities Act (Count V); and effecting transactions in unregistered security-based swaps with non-eligible contract participants in violation of Section 6(l) of the Exchange Act (Count VI). 
[.text-justify]
Defendants timely moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint on a smattering of grounds, including, among others, the argument that none of the crypto assets at issue is a security. [underline]#See# ECF No. 29. After full briefing and oral argument, the Court denied the motion to dismiss. [underline]#See# ECF No. 51. Discovery closed on October 27, 2023. [underline]#See# ECF No. 44. Each side moved under Rule 702 to exclude the expert witnesses of the other, and after full briefing, the Court heard oral argument on those motions on November 17, 2023. On November 20, 2023, the Court issued a “bottom-line” order granting the motions to exclude two of defendants’ three experts, but denying the motions to exclude defendants’ other expert and the SEC’s two experts. [underline]#See# ECF No. 130. This Opinion and Order first explains the reasons for those Rule 702 rulings, and then goes on to resolve the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment, on which the Court heard oral argument on November 30, 2023 after full briefing.

&period;&period;&period;

_(Section II Omitted)_

&period;&period;&period;

&emsp;III&period;&emsp;&emsp; [underline]#Motions for Summary Judgment#

&emsp;&emsp;A&period;&emsp; [underline]#Offering and Selling Unregistered Securities#

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1&period; [underline]#There is no genuine dispute that UST, LUNA, wLUNA, and MIR are securities because they are investment contracts.#
[.text-justify]
The SEC argues that four of Terraform’s crypto assets –- UST, LUNA, wLUNA, and MIR –- are securities, as defined in Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act for the purposes of the federal securities laws, because they are “investment contract[s].” 15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(1). Defendants first argue that, even if all the SEC’s allegations are credited, those assets are not investment contracts as a matter of law. In the alternative, defendants contest the SEC’s assertion that undisputed facts do indeed demonstrate that the crypto assets here at issue are investment contracts.
[.text-justify]
Defendants’ first argument in effect asks this Court to cast aside decades of settled law of the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit. In the seminal decision of [underline]#SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.#, 328 U.S. 293 (1946), the Supreme Court held in no uncertain terms that “an investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.” [underline]#Id.# at 298-99. Defendants urge this Court to scrap that definition, deeming it “dicta” that is the product of statutory interpretation of a bygone era.^*(xref:terraform_memorandum_and_opinion_fn_8[8])*^ The Court declines defendants’ invitation. [underline]#Howey#’s definition of “investment contract” was and remains a binding statement of the law, not dicta. And even if, in some conceivable reality, the Supreme Court intended the definition to be dicta, that is of no moment because the Second Circuit has likewise adopted the [underline]#Howey# test as the law.^*(xref:terraform_memorandum_and_opinion_fn_9[9])*^ [underline]#See, e.g.#, [underline]#Revak v. SEC Realty Corp.#, 18 F.3d 81, 87 (2d Cir. 1994).
[.text-justify]
There is no genuine dispute that the elements of the [underline]#Howey# test –- “(i) investment of money (ii) in a common enterprise (iii) with profits to be derived solely from the efforts of others” (id.) –- have been met for UST, LUNA, wLUNA, and MIR.
[.text-justify]
[underline]#UST#. Defendants make much of the fact, undisputed by the SEC, that UST on its own was not a security because purchasers understood that its value would remain stable at $1.00 rather than generate a profit. But, beginning in March 2021, holders of UST could deposit their tokens in the Anchor Protocol, which defendants’ efforts developed and which Kwon himself publicly announced would generate “by far the highest stablecoin yield in the market,” with a “target” of “20% fixed APR.” ECF No. 73, Ex. 66; [underline]#Id.#, Ex. 67. On May 11, 2021, Terraform wrote in a promotional Tweet that the Anchor Protocol would allow “third parties to seamlessly integrate 20% yield on $UST to expand stable savings opportunities to a greater audience.” [underline]#Id.#, Ex. 135. A 2020 white paper described Terraform’s work on the Anchor Protocol as “an attempt to give the main street investor a single, reliable, rate of return across all blockchains.” [underline]#Id.#, Ex. 44 at 2.
[.text-justify]
Once launched, returns from the Anchor Protocol were indeed paid out in proportion to the amount of UST tokens a person or entity had deposited. Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶ 80. The Anchor Protocol website stated that “[d]eposited stablecoins are pooled and lent out to borrowers, with accrued interest pro-rata distributed to all depositors.” [underline]#Id.# Terraform promoted in an October 2021 Tweet that it had configured its website to allow deposits of UST into the Anchor Protocol “directly from the Terra Station desktop wallet.” ECF No. 75, Ex. 136. A Terraform manager, Matthew Cantieri, led a team that worked on the Anchor Protocol. Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶ 83. His responsibilities included the ”strategic direction of the protocol, user adoption, making sure that people were accountable for product roadmap items, [and] working with Do [Kwon] and the team on what those products should be.” [underline]#Id.# By May 2022, there were approximately 18.5 billion tokens of UST, 14 billion of which had been deposited in the Anchor Protocol. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 36.
[.text-justify]
The above undisputed evidence clearly demonstrates that UST in combination with the Anchor Protocol constituted an investment contract. As the Supreme Court has held, it is of no legal consequence that not all holders of UST deposited tokens in the Anchor Protocol, and thus that some holders “ch[o]se not to accept the full offer of an investment contract.” [underline]#Howey#, 328 U.S. at 300. 
[.text-justify]
[underline]#LUNA and wLUNA#. Defendants’ efforts to rebut the evidence that LUNA and wLUNA were securities are even further off the mark. In denying the motion to dismiss, the Court held that, “by alleging that the defendants ‘pooled’ the proceeds of LUNA purchases together and promised that further investment through these purchases would benefit all LUNA holders, the SEC has adequately pled that the defendants and the investors were joined in a common, profit-seeking enterprise.” ECF No. 51, at 37. Those well-pleaded allegations have now been substantiated with undisputed evidence.^*(xref:terraform_memorandum_and_opinion_fn_10[10])*^ 
[.text-justify]
Kwon and others made specific, repeated statements that would lead a reasonable investor in LUNA to expect a profit based on defendants’ efforts to further develop the Terraform blockchain.
Terraform’s business development lead, Jeff Kuan, stated in a 2021 public interview that “investing in Terra means . . . buying LUNA, which is the ‘equity’ in our co.” Response to SEC 56.1 ¶ 63. Terraform’s head of communications, Brian Curran, remarked in a June 2021 public interview that “[o]wning LUNA is equivalent to owning a stake in the transaction fees of a network like Visa” because “[a]ll the transaction fees from Terra stablecoins are distributed to LUNA stakers in the form of staking rewards.” ECF No. 75, Ex. 107.
[.text-justify]
In a similar vein, Terraform’s Director of Special Projects, SJ Park, stated in a videotaped presentation around the same time that “[o]wning LUNA is essentially owning a stake in the network and a bet that value will continue to accrue over time.” Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶ 63. And Kwon himself wrote in a public Tweet that “$Luna value is actionable –- it grows as the [Terraform] ecosystem grows.” ECF No. 75, Ex. 108. In Kwon’s own words, a holder of LUNA could simply “[s]it back and watch [him] kick ass.” [underline]#Id.# In other words, a person could invest their “money in a common enterprise” and be “led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party,” namely, Terraform and Do Kwon himself.^*(xref:terraform_memorandum_and_opinion_fn_11[11])*^ [underline]#Howey#, 328 U.S. at 299. Indeed, the price of LUNA increased from under $1.00 in January 2021 to a high of over $119 in April 2022, before plummeting to under a penny in May 2022. ECF No. 75, Ex. 125.
[.text-justify]
[underline]#MIR#. Finally, the evidence shows beyond dispute that MIR was a security for similar reasons. “[T]he proceeds from sales of the MIR tokens were ‘pooled together’ to improve the Mirror Protocol,” and “[p]rofits derived from the use of the Mirror Protocol . . . were fed back to investors based on the size of their investment.” ECF No. 51, at 37. Terraform described MIR as a “governance token that earns fees from asset trades” on the Mirror Protocol that Terraform launched. Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶¶ 38, 101; ECF No. 73, Ex. 80. A Terraform press release at the launch of the Mirror Protocol touted that “[b]y adding the Mirror governance token –- MIR -- to liquidity pools, MIR holders can earn 0.25% from trading fees.” ECF No. 73, Ex. 80. Although Terraform labeled “the protocol [as] decentralized,” it explained that “the team behind Terra contributed most of the core development work behind the Mirror.” [underline]#Id.# Kwon himself sent promotional materials to a potential MIR purchaser, including a spreadsheet with a revenue projection table estimating how the price of MIR would increase as a result of greater usage of the Mirror Protocol. ECF No. 75, Ex. 148.
[.text-justify]
Terraform also described to potential investors its efforts to strengthen the Mirror Protocol, such as “deploying its UST reserves to make the markets for mAssets for the first year of the protocol,” building the Mirror Protocol website and hiring a firm to audit Terraform’s code for doing so, and publishing “dashboards” showing the Mirror Protocol’s growth. Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶¶ 102, 103, 107. In a public question-and-answer session, Terraform’s Community Lead, Aayush Gupta, stated on behalf of Terraform that the company was “very upbeat on our marketing campaign” and was “doing [its] best with its global suite of talent and organizing stuff like trading competitions and referral campaign to increase visibility for Mirror.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 108. In an April 2021 interview, Terraform’s head of communications, Brian Curran, stated that Terraform intended to launch a “V2” of the Mirror Protocol, which would bring “several major improvements,” and that Terraform planned to expand the Mirror Protocol “beyond SE Asia and the typical US market.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 109. Terraform employed a “product manager” for the Mirror Protocol and retained an administrative key to provide software updates to it. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 111. Terraform used proceeds from the sale of MIR, which it pooled, “to make payments for services, salary, and operations.” ECF No. 77, at ¶ 25; [underline]#see Id.# at ¶¶ 29-32.
[.text-justify]
In light of all this, defendants cannot meaningfully dispute that they led holders of MIR to expect profit from a common enterprise based on Terraform’s efforts to develop, maintain, and grow the Mirror Protocol -- in other words, that MIR passes the [underline]#Howey# test with flying colors. 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2&period; [underline]#There is no genuine dispute that defendants offered and sold unregistered securities, in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.#
[.text-justify]
The Court grants summary judgment to the SEC on Count IV of the Amended Complaint because defendants offered and sold unregistered securities, in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. In particular, defendants offered and sold LUNA and MIR in unregistered transactions.
[.text-justify]
“Section 5 requires that securities be registered with the SEC before any person may sell or offer to sell such securities.” [underline]#SEC v. Cavanagh#, 445 F.3d 105, 111 (2d Cir. 2006). Section 5(a) covers unregistered sales and Section 5(c) covers unregistered offers. [underline]#See# 15 U.S.C. § 77e(a), (c). To prove liability under Section 5, the SEC must show “(1) lack of a registration statement as to the subject securities; (2) the offer or sale of the securities; and (3) the use of interstate transportation or communication and the mails in connection with the offer or sale.” [underline]#Cavanagh#, 445 F.3d at 111 n.13. Only the second element is contested here.
[.text-justify]
Terraform sold LUNA tokens directly to institutional investors through sales agreements that expressly contemplated Terraform’s development of a secondary market. Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶¶ 117–19. The terms of those agreements provided a builtin incentive for secondary resale because Terraform sold LUNA to
initial investors at discounts of up to, and sometimes more than, 40%. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 119. In a fundraising update in December 2018, Terraform co-founder Daniel Shin wrote that Terraform had “begun exchange listing discussions given token listing is a precondition for [the] Terra/Luna ecosystem to operate.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 121. Similarly, as Terraform provided loans of tens of millions of LUNA tokens to trading firm Jump, Kwon announced Terraform’s expectation that Jump would “improve liquidity of LUNA in secondary trading markets.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 126. Kwon stated that, before Jump’s involvement, LUNA’s liquidity had been “rather lackluster partly due to our team’s inexperience with secondary markets & trading operations.” [underline]#Id.#
[.text-justify]
Terraform’s offers and sales of MIR were similar. A Terraform subsidiary sold MIR tokens directly to purchasers through “Simple Agreements for Farmed Tokens,” or SAFTs. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 135. Those agreements did not restrict purchasers from reselling their MIR tokens in secondary trading markets or to U.S. investors. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 136. Terraform also loaned up to 4 million MIR tokens to Jump, in an agreement that expressly required Jump to trade MIR tokens on crypto asset trading platforms and to provide Terraform with reports of its trading. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 138. Terraform also sold both LUNA and MIR tokens to secondary market purchasers on Binance and other crypto trading exchanges. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 142. The record provides no evidence that Terraform took steps to determine whether those trading platforms were available to U.S. investors. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 143.
[.text-justify]
Defendants argue that even if LUNA and MIR were securities, they were exempt from registration. But “[o]nce a prima facie case” of Section 5 liability “has been made, the defendant bears the burden of proving the applicability of an exemption.” [underline]#Cavanagh#, 445 F.3d at 111 n.13. Defendants have not carried that burden here.
[.text-justify]
Defendants contend that their distributions of LUNA and MIR were not public offerings because they only sold directly to sophisticated investors. [underline]#See# ECF No. 100 (“Defs.’ Mem.”), at 25–27; [underline]#SEC v. Ralston Purina Co.#, 346 U.S. 119, 125 (“An offering to those who are shown to be able to fend for themselves is a transaction ‘not involving any public offering.’”). But to avail themselves of that exemption, defendants would need to also show that they “intended” the LUNA and MIR tokens “to come to rest with” those sophisticated investors. [underline]#SEC v. Telegram Grp. Inc.#, 448 F. Supp. 3d 352, 380 (S.D.N.Y. 2020). The natural problem for defendants is that “securities do not come to rest with investors who intend a further distribution.” [underline]#Id.# at 380. Terraform’s own repeated statements about developing a liquid secondary market for LUNA, and its express requirement that Jump trade MIR on exchanges -- and even that Jump provide reports to Terraform about that secondary trading -- make plain that neither Terraform nor its institutional investors had any intent to simply hold onto LUNA or MIR without further trades. It is immaterial that the vesting period in certain sales agreements “precluded immediate resale” or “that LUNA was not listed on any trading platform at the time of the purchases” by those institutional investors. Defs.’ Mem. at 25.
[.text-justify]
Defendants also argue that certain sales agreements for LUNA were exempt from registration under Regulation S, which states that Section 5’s reference to offers and sales refers only to those “that occur within the United States.” 17 C.F.R. § 230.901. But defendants point to no evidence -- as they must, given that they bear the burden of proof on this exemption -- showing that they reasonably believed “at the commencement of the offering” that there was “no substantial U.S. market interest” or that they took any steps to prevent resale of LUNA and MIR into the U.S. market. [underline]#Id.# § 230.903. Conjecture that “if a purchaser intended to sell its LUNA, it could have done so without violating Section 5 by selling on any of several foreign platforms under Regulation S’s exemption,” is not evidence that purchasers limited their resales to foreign exchanges or that Terraform believed purchasers did so. Defs.’ Mem at 25-26.
[.text-justify]
The SEC is thus entitled to summary judgment of liability on Count IV of the Amended Complaint for defendants’ unregistered offers and sales of LUNA and MIR. The SEC’s motion for summary judgment made no mention of potential remedies, which will be determined once the question of liability has been resolved for all claims.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;3&period; [underline]#As a matter of law, defendants did not offer or effect transactions in security-based swaps.#
[.text-justify]
The Court grants summary judgment for defendants on Counts V and VI of the Amended Complaint, alleging that  defendants offered unregistered security-based swaps to non-eligible contract participants, in violation of Section 5(e) of the Securities Act, and effected transactions in security-based swaps with noneligible contract participants, in violation of Section 6(l) of the Exchange Act. Although the SEC makes no argument that an mAsset is itself a security, [underline]#see# ECF No. 142 (“Summary Judgment Arg. Tr.”), at 6 (counsel for the SEC conceding the point), the SEC asserts that by creating and maintaining the Mirror Protocol through which others could mint mAssets, defendants offered and effected transactions in security-based swaps. The Court holds, however, that an mAsset does not meet the statutory definition of a security-based swap.
[.text-justify]
The Commodity Exchange Act defines a “swap” as “any agreement, contract, or transaction . . . that provides on an executory basis for the exchange . . . of 1 or more payments based on the value or level of 1 or more . . . securities . . . and that transfers, as between the parties to the transaction, in whole or in part, the financial risk associated with a future change in any such value or level without also conveying a current or future direct or indirect ownership interest in an asset.” 7 U.S.C. § 1a(47)(A)(iii). A “security-based swap” is such a swap that, as relevant here, “is based on . . . a single security.” 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(68). 
[.text-justify]
The Mirror Protocol’s mAssets satisfy most -- but not all -- of the definition’s requirements. A user who mints or purchases an mAsset through the Mirror Protocol indeed exchanges a payment based on the value of some underlying reference security, such as a share of Apple. Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶¶ 112–14. And the user does so without receiving any ownership interest in the underlying security. [underline]#Id.# But, crucially, there is no transfer of financial risk involved here. Whenever the price of an underlying security increases above the user’s initial payment, or collateral, for the mAsset, the user is required to deposit additional collateral to meet the higher price. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 114. In other words, a user cannot profit from holding an mAsset because his deposit must always exceed the value of the underlying reference security. If the user fails to deposit sufficient additional collateral, the mAsset will be lost. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 114.
[.text-justify]
As a result, there is no evidence in the record showing how a holder of an mAsset transfers any “financial risk associated with a future change” in the value of a security to or from a counterparty in a transaction. 7 U.S.C. § 1a(47)(A)(iii). Rather, the holder bears all the risk for himself. The SEC nevertheless waves its hand and contends “that the financial risk is actually being transferred to the investor, to the one minting the asset.” Summary Judgment Arg. Tr. 13. But the fact that the minter of an mAsset bears financial risk from his own choice to deposit collateral, which could lead to the loss of that collateral, does not mean that any of that risk was “transfer[red]” to him by a counterparty in a transaction. 7 U.S.C. § 1a(47)(A)(iii). Instead, the minter holds the risk all along. As a result, because mAssets are not security-based swaps, the Court grants summary judgment for defendants dismissing Counts V and VI of the Amended Complaint.

[small]##*9* Defendants’ argument that the Supreme Court conducts statutory interpretation differently nowadays, and thus would not today independently reach the same holding it did in [underline]#Howey#, is no more persuasive even if the premise is credited [underline]#arguendo#. The Supreme Court has cautioned that “other courts should [not] conclude that [its] more recent cases have, by implication, overruled an earlier precedent.” [underline]#Agostini v. Felton#, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997). When a Supreme Court precedent “has direct application in a case,” as [underline]#Howey# does here, this Court must follow it, even if it “appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions.” [underline]#Id.# In any event, neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has ever suggested that [underline]#Howey# rests on a shaky foundation.##

[small]##*11* Defendants challenge as inadmissible the declaration of Donald Hong, the SEC’s summary witness who reviewed Terraform’s financial records to show that the funds from LUNA purchases were indeed pooled. Defendants argue that Hong’s declaration is a last-minute, back-door expert report because he states that “the evidence reflects that defendants pooled investor funds into wallet addresses, crypto trading platform accounts, and bank accounts they controlled and used those funds to make payments for business expenses.” ECF No. 123 (“Defs.’ Opp.”), at 7. But a witness providing “a summary of the relevant financial records” is not supplying expert testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 702. [underline]#United States v.

And, as the SEC points out, “Hong’s summary is even more mechanical than the analyses approved as summary testimony in [underline]#Lebedev# . . ., which relied on accounting methodologies.” ECF No. 127 (“SEC Reply”), at 8; [underline]#see also# Fed.
