*SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT*
[.text-justify, start=1]
. The Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York (“OAG”) commenced an investigation pursuant to New York General Business Law § 352 et. seq. (the “Martin Act”) and Executive Law § 63(12) regarding fraud in connection with the Bitfinex trading platform and related matters. On April 24, 2019, the OAG filed a proceeding in Supreme Court, New York County pursuant to Section 354 of the Martin Act, seeking a court order to enjoin certain conduct by iFinex Inc., BFXNA Inc., BFXWW Inc. (collectively, “Bitfinex”), and Tether Holdings Limited, Tether Operations Limited, Tether Limited, and Tether International Limited (collectively, “Tether”), including the transfer of certain funds between the entities; enjoining the destruction of documents and communications relevant to the investigation; and ordering production of certain documents and information. That order was granted. In re: James v. iFinex, et al., Index No. 450545/2019 (Apr. 24, 2019), aff’d 2020 N.Y. Slip Op. 03880 (July 9, 2020).
. This Settlement Agreement contains the findings of the OAG’s investigation and the relief agreed to by the OAG, Bitfinex, and Tether, whether acting through their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries (collectively, the “Parties”). 
. The OAG finds that the conduct set forth herein violated the Martin Act and Executive Law § 63(12).
. The OAG finds the relief and agreements contained in this Settlement Agreement appropriate and in the public interest. Therefore, the OAG is willing to accept this Settlement Agreement pursuant to Executive Law § 63(15), in lieu of commencing a statutory proceeding for violations of the Martin Act and Executive Law § 63(12), based on the conduct described below.
. Bitfinex and Tether neither admit nor deny the OAG’s findings set forth below.

[.text-center.underline]
*OAG’s FINDINGS*

*I&period; [.underline]#Bitfinex and Tether#*

[.text-justify, start=6]
. Bitfinex operates an online platform for exchanging and trading virtual currency. Users access the Bitfinex trading platform and place orders through its website, available at www.bitfinex.com, through an associated Application Programming Interface (“API”), or via over-the-counter services. Bitfinex also provides users with the ability to store their virtual currency and transfer their holdings to a different trading platform. Bitfinex is one of the relatively few virtual currency trading platforms that allows traders to deposit and withdraw socalled “fiat” currency, including U.S. dollars, euros, pounds, and yen. Traders using the Bitfinex platform can deposit dollars with Bitfinex, convert them to virtual currency at the rates offered by Bitfinex, trade the virtual currency they have purchased, convert their virtual currency holdings back into dollars, and withdraw the funds. For that reason, it is important that Bitfinex has sufficient U.S. dollars on hand to fill withdrawal orders submitted by traders.
. Prior to August 2017, Bitfinex had few geographical restrictions with respect to who could access its trading platform, meaning that New York-based users were able to create accounts, fund them with U.S. dollars, convert into virtual currency, trade, and withdraw funds. In August 2017, Bitfinex announced it would no longer permit U.S.-based users to access the trading platform, but U.S.-based business entities were still permitted to trade. In August 2018, Bitfinex’s announced exclusion of U.S.-based individual users was expanded to include all U.S.-based entities, except those entities or organizations that maintained an incorporation address outside of the United States, and met other qualifications.
. The primary function of Tether the company is as the issuer of a virtual currency also called “tether,” a so-called “stablecoin,” a term used to describe a virtual currency that is always supposed to have the same real-dollar value. In the case of tethers, one tether is always supposed to be valued at one U.S. dollar. Tethers are listed on at least several dozen virtual currency trading platforms around the world, trading under the symbol “USDT.” 
. In order to signal to the market that each tether held by users is equal to one U.S. dollar, Tether has long represented that for every outstanding tether issued and trading in the market, the company holds one U.S. dollar (“USD”) in reserve “backing” the tether. From its inception in 2014 until late February 2019, Tether represented that every outstanding tether was “backed” by, and thus should be valued at, one U.S. dollar. For example, Tether represented to users that “Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves. So 1 USDT is always equivalent to 1 USD.”
. In late February 2019, Tether changed its representation, stating on its website that “[e]very tether is always 100% backed by our reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities (collectively, ‘reserves’). Every tether is also 1-to-1 pegged to the dollar, so 1 USDT is always valued by Tether at 1 USD.”
. Tether represents to users that any holder of tethers can redeem them from Tether the company at the rate of one tether for one U.S. dollar. 
. Tether is one of the most prominent and widely-traded virtual currencies. As of the date of this Settlement Agreement, Tether represents that over 31 billion tethers have been issued and are outstanding and traded in the market.
. Bitfinex and Tether are owned and operated by a small group of executives and shareholders that are located around the world. During the time period relevant to the OAG’s investigation, and as late as early-to-mid 2018, one of Bitfinex and Tether’s senior executives lived in, and conducted his work from, New York.

*II&period; In 2017, Bitfinex and Tether Misled the Market About Tether’s U.S. Dollar Backing*

[.text-justify, start=14]
. Prior to 2017, Bitfinex and Tether used several Taiwan-based banks to send and receive wire transfers to fulfill client orders for U.S. dollars, and for other purposes. Wells Fargo acted as the correspondent bank. In late March 2017, Wells Fargo elected to no longer process U.S. dollar wire transfers from Bitfinex and Tether accounts, forcing the companies to find alternative banking arrangements.
. At the time Wells Fargo stopped servicing the companies, approximately 50 million tethers had been issued and were circulating in the market. By May 31, 2017, over 108 million tethers had been issued and circulating.
. In June 2017, Bitfinex opened an account at a Puerto Rico-based entity named Noble Bank International (“Noble Bank”). Noble Bank was a subsidiary of New York-based Noble Markets LLC.
. However, Tether did not open an account at Noble Bank, or any other bank, until September 15, 2017. Tether deposited the vast majority of its cash holdings (ostensibly backing USDT) into a trust account at the Bank of Montreal in the name of its General Counsel. The Bank of Montreal account never had more than $61.5 million dollars on deposit.
. Because Tether did not have a significant bank relationship in its name from at least March 2017 until September 15, 2017, it could not directly process any fiat deposits for purchases of Tethers by customers on either the Tether website or via the Bitfinex trading platform. At the same time, neither the Tether website or the Bitfinex trading platform allowed for the direct purchase or exchange of tethers in exchange for any other virtual currency, including the two most popular virtual currencies, bitcoin and ether.
. Between June 1, 2017 and September 15, 2017, Bitfinex’s Noble Bank account received USD deposits from only two institutional trading firms, one of which was located in New York. Neither of those institutional trading firms purchased tethers directly from Bitfinex or Tether during this time period.
. Because of Tether’s inability to conduct significant banking activity during this time, it could not itself hold dollars sufficient to back the hundreds of millions of new tethers that had entered the market. Until September 15, 2017, the only U.S. dollars held by Tether ostensibly backing the approximately 442 million tethers in circulation was the approximately $61 million on deposit at the Bank of Montreal.
. Between June 1, 2017 and September 15, 2017, Bitfinex held approximately $382 million of Tether’s funds in a comingled account, which should have been held by Tether as “backing” for tethers then in circulation but was not. In certain documents Bitfinex and Tether produced to OAG during its investigation, Tether accounted for this amount as a “receivable” from Bitfinex. Between June 1, 2017 and September 15, 2017, the total number of tethers issued and circulating rose from approximately 108 million to 442 million.
. In June 2017, Bitfinex and Tether engaged the U.S.-based firm Friedman LLP to complete an audit of both companies. Those audits were never completed. 
. By late summer 2017, online reports suggested that Tether did not have sufficient cash backing for the increasing numbers of tethers in circulation. To counter those suggestions, in early September 2017, Bitfinex and Tether requested that Friedman conduct a verification of the cash backing of tethers, which Bitfinex and Tether planned to release publicly in order to demonstrate to the market that tethers were fully backed.
. Tether notified Friedman that the company did not have a bank account at Noble Bank (or any other institution) but were in the process of opening one.
. Tether and Friedman agreed that Friedman would conduct the verification of Tether’s assets as of September 15, 2017.
. On the morning of September 15, 2017, Tether opened an account at Noble Bank. Later that day, Bitfinex transferred $382,446,847.71 from Bitfinex’s account at Noble Bank into Tether’s account at Noble Bank. Friedman conducted its verification of Tether’s assets as of 8:00 p.m. EST.
. On September 30, 2017, a post to the Tether website was made, entitled “Transparency Update,” in which Tether represented the following: +
[.quoteblock]#Friedman LLP has been engaged to perform historical balance sheet audit procedures for Tether Limited. However, as the amount of Tethers in circulation has increased substantially in recent months, we have also asked Friedman to analyze our bank balances and our issued and outstanding token balance on an interim basis. Friedman agreed to perform consulting services for us in an effort to provide management with useful information concerning Tether’s cash position and Tether tokens issued and outstanding as of an interim date. Friedman was able to provide consulting services for us on an expedited basis, using a procedures date of September 15, 2017. These consulting services do not constitute anaudit [sic] or attestation engagement, which would include a significantly expanded scope of procedures and take substantially more time to complete. +
&nbsp; +
We hope that the community considers the attached memorandum for what it is: a good faith effort on our behalf to provide an interim analysis of our cash position and our issued and outstanding tokens, as part of ongoing efforts to further professionalize the transparency mechanisms of Tether Limited.#
. The attached memorandum from Friedman contained the following graphic, redacting the account holder’s name, and redacting the names of Noble Bank and the Bank of Montreal:

image::media/oag_tether_image_1.png[align=center]

[.text-justify, start=29]
. The September 30, 2017 “Transparency Update” and the attached memorandum were misleading. At no point did Tether inform its clients or the market that from at least June 1, 2017 until September 15, 2017, tethers were not in fact not backed “1-to-1” by USD held by Tether in a bank account. Rather, the funds ostensibly backing tethers had been held in an account under the control of its General Counsel, with the balance accounted for as a “receivable” from Bitfinex. No one reviewing Tether’s representations would have reasonably understood that the $382,064,782 listed as cash reserves for tethers had only been placed in Tether’s account as of the very morning that Friedman verified the bank balance.

*III&period; In 2019, Bitfinex and Tether Misrepresented the Status of the Tether Reserves, 
After Bitfinex Suffered a Massive Loss of Funds*

[.text-justify, start=30]
. In 2017 and 2018, Bitfinex began to increasingly rely on third-party “payment processors” to handle customer deposits and withdrawals from the Bitfinex trading platform. The primary entity Bitfinex used was a purportedly Panama-based entity known as Crypto Capital Corp. (“Crypto Capital”).
. An individual known as “Oz Yosef,” or “Oz Joseph,” or simply “Oz” was Bitfinex’s point of contact at Crypto Capital. 
. By mid-2018, Crypto Capital held over $1 billion of funds that emanated from customer deposits at Bitfinex.
. In May 2018, Bitfinex asked “Oz” how Bitfinex could “move money efficiently out of Cryptocapital.” That request came on the heels of a report in April 2018 that the government of Poland had frozen a Crypto Capital bank account holding at least $340 million. In response, “Oz” repeatedly stated that the account freeze was temporary. In the ensuing months, “Oz” would go on to provide a number of different excuses for why he could not return the funds to Bitfinex (or its clients), including tax complications, hurdles placed by various compliance personnel at various banks, bankers being on vacation, typos in wire instructions, and corruption in the Polish government.
. At some point between April 2018 and July 2018, “Oz” informed Bitfinex that a Crypto Capital account in Portugal containing approximately $150 million of Bitfinex client funds had also been frozen.
. In July 2018, Bitfinex told “Oz,” that over eighty percent of Bitfinex’s client deposits were held at bank accounts controlled by Crypto Capital. 
. Despite having nearly $500 million of customer deposits in Crypto Capital accounts purportedly “frozen,” Bitfinex nevertheless continued to direct clients to utilize Crypto Capital to fund their accounts throughout the summer of 2018.
. During this time period, Bitfinex began to look for ways to stave off what Bitfinex internally characterized as a “temporary liquidity crisis.” 
. In the summer of 2018, Bitfinex borrowed $400 million from Tether. On or about August 21, 2018, and continuing through September 2018, Tether made at least four cash transfers from its account at Deltec Bank to Bitfinex’s account at Deltec Bank. To offset those cash transfers, Bitfinex directed “Oz” to transfer funds from the Bitfinex account to the Tether account at Crypto Capital. In October 2018, Bitfinex redeemed 400 million tethers to repay the debt. Those transactions were not disclosed.
. Despite efforts to stave off Bitfinex’s “liquidity crisis,” online reports continued to mount that Bitfinex was unable or unwilling to timely process client withdrawal requests. In response, Bitfinex issued the following statement to the market on October 7, 2018:
[numeric]
.. Bitfinex is not insolvent, and a constant stream of Medium articles claiming otherwise is not going to change this. As one of only a very few exchanges operating since 2013, with a small team and low operating costs, we do not entirely understand the arguments that purport to show us to be insolvent without providing any explanation about why. The wallets below represent a small fraction of Bitfinex cryptocurrency holdings and do not take into account fiat holdings of any kind. +
&emsp;• Bitcoin cold wallet 1 +
&emsp;• Ethereum cold wallet 1 +
&emsp;• EOS cold wallet 1 +
How any rational party can claim insolvency when the opposite is there for all to see is interesting and, once again, perhaps indicative of a targeted campaign based on nothing but fiction.
.. Both fiat and cryptocurrency withdrawals are functioning as normal. Verified Bitfinex users can freely withdraw Euros, Japanese Yen, Pounds Sterling and U.S. Dollars. Complications continue to exist for us in the domain of fiat transactions, as they do for most cryptocurrency-related organisations. However, we continue to do our utmost to minimise any waiting times associated with fiat deposits and withdrawals.
.. Stories and allegations currently circulating mentioning an entity called Noble Bank have no impact on our operations, survivability, or solvency.
. That statement was misleading. At the time this statement was made, Bitfinex had been beseeching “Oz” for months to process client withdrawals or return the money, which “Oz” was unable or unwilling to do. The statement also misleadingly implied that the company had little or no connection to “an entity called Noble Bank,” which at that time had been Bitfinex’s bank for over a year.
. In October 2018, Bitfinex and Tether severed their relationship with Noble Bank.
. On November 1, 2018, Tether made a public statement announcing that it had established a relationship with Deltec Bank & Trust Limited, headquartered in the Bahamas. In that announcement, Tether represented that “USDT in the market are fully backed by US dollars that are safely deposited in our bank accounts.” The announcement also linked to a document on Deltec letterhead and addressed to Tether Limited, dated November 1, 2018, which stated: +
[.quoteblock]#Dear Sirs: +
We hereby confirm that, at the close of business on October 31, 2018, the portfolio cash value of your account with our bank was US$1,831,322,828.#
. The next day, November 2, 2018, Tether made the first of five transfers ultimately totaling $475 million from its bank account at Deltec Bank to Bitfinex’s account at Deltec Bank. At the same time, a corresponding transfer was made from Bitfinex’s account at Crypto Capital to Tether’s account at Crypto Capital via ledger entry Bitfinex also “purchased” 150 million tethers by transferring $150 million in funds held at Bitfinex’s Crypto Capital account to Tether’s account at Crypto Capital. These transfers were not disclosed.
. And so, as of November 2, 2018, tethers were again no longer backed 1-to-1 by U.S. dollars in a Tether bank account, because a substantial portion of the backing in the Deltec account had been transferred to Bitfinex to make up for the funds taken by Crypto Capital, while the corresponding funds transferred from Bitfinex’s Crypto Capital account to Tether’s Crypto Capital account were impaired by Crypto Capital’s actions.
. Tether’s misrepresentation would continue until late February 2019, at which time Tether updated its website to note that “[e]very tether is always 100% backed by our reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities (collectively, ‘reserves’).” Tether did not announce that it had changed its disclosure, and indeed there were no media reports about the change until several weeks later on March 14, 2019.
. Throughout November, Bitfinex would continue to ask “Oz” to return the money, to no avail. For example, on November 1, 2018, Bitfinex told “Oz” that Bitfinex “urgently need liquidity to start paying out our small customer as your channel is stuck.” On November 21, 2018, Bitfinex told “Oz” that “We have 860m with you. I can’t believe we can’t even get 20 or 30 M out…where is all the money, it doesn’t sum up…350 in Poland, 150 in Portugal.” On November 28, 2018, Bitfinex again messaged “Oz,” stating that “we are at the end of the month and you haven’t been sending out one wire, even 1 usd for the whole month.”
. Contrary to what was happening behind the scenes, Bitfinex issued a statement on November 11, 2018, stating that Bitfinex’s “banking remained stable,” while noting that in October 2018 alone Bitfinex “processed over 700 withdrawals representing more than $1 [billion].”
. As set forth in further detail in the OAG’s application for relief pursuant to Section 354 of the Martin Act, in late 2018 Bitfinex and Tether began to negotiate a line of credit transaction that would allow Bitfinex to further draw upon the Tether reserves. Ultimately, the line of credit transaction closed at the end of March 2019, allowing Bitfinex to draw up to $900 million from the Tether reserves. The $625 million that had been previously transferred from the Tether account in November 2018 was incorporated into the line of credit. Bitfinex collateralized the line of credit with shares of its parent company Digfinex.
. At no time did Bitfinex or Tether disclose to the market that Tether had transferred at least $625 million to Bitfinex, or that Bitfinex had experienced critical liquidity issues because of loss of approximately $850 million to Crypto Capital.
. On April 24, 2019, the OAG filed an application in Supreme Court, New York County for an order pursuant to Section 354 of the Martin Act, seeking court-ordered production of documents and information relevant to its ongoing investigation of Bitfinex and Tether, as well as seeking injunctive relief to prevent Bitfinex from further accessing Tether’s reserves under the line of credit arrangement. As part of that application, the OAG disclosed to the market for the first time that Bitfinex had lost access to approximately $850 million, and that Bitfinex had made up for the shortfall by transferring hundreds of millions of dollars from Tether.
. On April 26, 2019, Bitfinex issued a statement, which included a representation that “we have been informed that these Crypto Capital amounts are not lost but have been, in fact, seized and safeguarded.”
. That statement was misleading. At the time that statement was made, Bitfinex did not in fact know the whereabouts of all of the customer funds held by Crypto Capital, and so had no assurance that the funds might ever be made accessible again to Crypto Capital or Bitfinex.
. As of the date of this Settlement Agreement, Bitfinex cannot represent whether, or when, any of the unrecovered funds might be returned to Bitfinex or its clients.
. Based on the foregoing facts, OAG finds that Bitfinex and Tether violated New York General Business Law § 352 et seq. and Executive Law § 62(12).
