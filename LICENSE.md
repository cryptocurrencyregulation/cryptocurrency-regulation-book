The current license does **not permit derivative or commercial work**. This means, it does **not** permit independent translations without pemission/license from publisher. It also does not permit the production and circulation of PDF, HTML or other derivative renderings of the source ASCIIDOC, (with the exception for personal use only, not shared with others).

## Licensing change in 12 months

It is expected that the book will be released under a more permissive CC-BY-SA license within a year of publication (i.e. May 2024). At that time we will provide a Transifex project for volunteer translations and it will be allowed to produce and share PDF or other ebook versions of the book.
