== Chapter 2: Initial Coin Offerings and Cryptocurrency Sales ==

After Bitcoin became popular, over ten thousand other cryptocurrencies were created by individuals and organizations.  Some of these cryptocurrencies were very similar to Bitcoin, other currencies were significantly different in a variety of ways.  We will discuss several of these currencies over the following chapters, including Ethereum and Ripple.  

One of the key legal issues of this chapter is under what circumstances will a cryptocurrency transaction be considered an investment contract under the Howey test?  

This chapter begins with the DAO Report issued by the SEC followed by a speech by William Hinman of the SEC.  The chapter than proceeds to the court opinions in SEC vs. LBRY, SEC vs. Ripple Labs, and SEC vs. Terraform Labs.

On July 17th, 2017, the Securities Exchange Commission released a report analyzing whether The DAO violated U.S. securities laws by selling cryptocurrency tokens.  The DAO was the first major Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on the Ethereum blockchain.  The DAO was launched on April 29, 2016.  In one of most famous cryptocurrency hacks, DAO funds were stolen on June 16th, 2016.  On July 20th, 2016, the Ethereum blockchain changed its software to return all of the stolen funds to the original owners.  For a detailed understanding of the founding of the Ethereum blockchain and the DAO hack (including the identity of the DAO hacker), I recommend Laura Shin's book, "The Cryptopians: Idealism, Greed, Lies, and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Craze."

*Report of Investigation Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO*

[upperroman, start=1]
. *Introduction and Summary*

[.text-justify]
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“Commission”) Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has investigated whether The DAO, an unincorporated organization; Slock.it UG (“Slock.it”), a German corporation; Slock.it’s co-founders; and intermediaries may have violated the federal securities laws. The Commission has determined not to pursue an enforcement action in this matter based on the conduct and activities known to the Commission at this time.
[.text-justify]
As described more fully below, The DAO is one example of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, which is a term used to describe a “virtual” organization embodied in computer code and executed on a distributed ledger or blockchain. The DAO was created by Slock.it and Slock.it’s co-founders, with the objective of operating as a for-profit entity that would create and hold a corpus of assets through the sale of DAO Tokens to investors, which assets would then be used to fund “projects.” The holders of DAO Tokens stood to share in the anticipated earnings from these projects as a return on their investment in DAO Tokens. In addition, DAO Token holders could monetize their investments in DAO Tokens by re-selling DAO Tokens on a number of web-based platforms (“Platforms”) that supported secondary trading in the DAO Tokens.
[.text-justify]
After DAO Tokens were sold, but before The DAO was able to commence funding projects, an attacker used a flaw in The DAO’s code to steal approximately one-third of The DAO’s assets. Slock.it’s co-founders and others responded by creating a work-around whereby DAO Token holders could opt to have their investment returned to them, as described in more detail below.
[.text-justify]
The investigation raised questions regarding the application of the U.S. federal securities laws to the offer and sale of DAO Tokens, including the threshold question whether DAO Tokens are securities. Based on the investigation, and under the facts presented, the Commission has determined that DAO Tokens are securities under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).footnote:[This Report does not analyze the question whether The DAO was an “investment company,” as defined under
Section 3(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Investment Company Act”), in part, because The DAO never
commenced its business operations funding projects. Those who would use virtual organizations should consider
their obligations under the Investment Company Act.] The Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to issue this report of investigation (“Report”) pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Exchange Actfootnote:[Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to investigate violations of the federal securities
laws and, in its discretion, to “publish information concerning any such violations.” This Report does not constitute
an adjudication of any fact or issue addressed herein, nor does it make any findings of violations by any individual
or entity. The facts discussed in Section II, infra, are matters of public record or based on documentary records. We
are publishing this Report on the Commission’s website to ensure that all market participants have concurrent and
equal access to the information contained herein.] to advise those who would use a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (“DAO Entity”), or other distributed ledger or blockchain-enabled means for capital raising, to take appropriate steps to ensure compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws. All securities offered and sold in the United States must be registered with the Commission or must qualify for an exemption from the registration requirements. In addition, any entity or person engaging in the activities of an exchange must register as a national securities exchange or operate pursuant to an exemption from such registration.
[.text-justify]
This Report reiterates these fundamental principles of the U.S. federal securities laws and describes their applicability to a new paradigm—virtual organizations or capital raising entities that use distributed ledger or blockchain technology to facilitate capital raising and/or investment and the related offer and sale of securities. The automation of certain functions through this technology, “smart contracts,”footnote:[Computer scientist Nick Szabo described a “smart contract” as:
[.quoteblock .text-justify]#a computerized transaction protocol that executes terms of a contract. The general objectives of smart contract design are to satisfy common contractual conditions (such as payment terms, liens, confidentiality, and even enforcement), minimize exceptions both malicious and accidental, and minimize the need for trusted intermediaries. Related economic goals include lowering fraud loss, arbitrations and enforcement costs, and other transaction costs.#] or computer code, does not remove conduct from the purview of the U.S. federal securities laws.footnote:[++See SEC v. C.M. Joiner Leasing Corp., 320 U.S. 344, 351 (1943) (“[T]he reach of the [Securities] Act does not stop with the obvious and commonplace. Novel, uncommon, or irregular devices, whatever they appear to be, are
also reached if it be proved as matter of fact that they were widely offered or dealt in under terms or courses of
dealing which established their character in commerce as ‘investment contracts,’ or as ‘any interest or instrument
commonly known as a ‘security’.”); see also Reves v. Ernst & Young, 494 U.S. 56, 61 (1990) (“Congress’ purpose
in enacting the securities laws was to regulate investments, in whatever form they are made and by whatever name
they are called.”).++] This Report also serves to stress the obligation to comply with the registration provisions of the federal securities laws with respect to products and platforms involving emerging technologies and new investor interfaces.

[.text-justify]
From April 30, 2016 through May 28, 2016, The DAO offered and sold approximately 1.15 billion DAO Tokens in exchange for a total of approximately 12 million Ether (“ETH”), a virtual currency footnote:[The Financial Action Task Force defines “virtual currency” as: [.quoteblock .text-justify]#a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded and functions as: (1) a medium of exchange; and/or (2) a unit of account; and/or (3) a store of value, but does not have legal tender status (i.e., when tendered to a creditor, is a valid and legal offer of payment) in any jurisdiction. It is not issued or guaranteed by any jurisdiction, and fulfils the above functions only by agreement within the community of users of the virtual currency. Virtual currency is distinguished from fiat currency (a.k.a. “real currency,” “real money,” or “national currency”), which is the coin and paper money of a country that is designated as its legal tender; circulates; and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the issuing country. It is distinct from e-money, which is a digital representation of fiat currency used to electronically transfer value denominated in fiat currency.# FATF Report, Virtual Currencies, Key Definitions and Potential AML/CFT Risks, FINANCIAL ACTION TASK FORCE (June 2014), http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/Virtual-currency-key-definitions-and-potentialaml-cft-risks.pdf.]] used on the Ethereum Blockchain.footnote:[Ethereum, developed by the Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit organization, is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts on a blockchain known as the Ethereum Blockchain.]]  As of the time the offering closed, the total ETH raised by The DAO was valued in U.S. Dollars (“USD”) at approximately $150 million.

[.text-justify]
The concept of a DAO Entity is memorialized in a document (the “White Paper”), authored by Christoph Jentzsch, the Chief Technology Officer of Slock.it, a “Blockchain and IoT [(internet-of-things)] solution company,” incorporated in Germany and co-founded by Christoph Jentzsch, Simon Jentzsch (Christoph Jentzsch’s brother), and Stephan Tual (“Tual”). footnote:[Christoph Jentzsch released the final draft of the White Paper on or around March 23, 2016. He introduced his concept of a DAO Entity as early as November 2015 at an Ethereum Developer Conference in London, as a medium to raise funds for Slock.it, a German start-up he co-founded in September 2015. Slock.it purports to create technology that embeds smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Blockchain into real-world devices and, as a result, for example, permits anyone to rent, sell or share physical objects in a decentralized way. See SLOCK.IT, https://slock.it/.]] The White Paper purports to describe “the first implementation of a [DAO Entity] code to automate organizational governance and decision making.”footnote:[Christoph Jentzsch, Decentralized Autonomous Organization to Automate Governance Final Draft – Under Review, https://download.slock.it/public/DAO/WhitePaper.pdf.]] The White Paper posits that a DAO Entity “can be used by individuals working together collaboratively outside of a traditional corporate form. It can also be used by a registered corporate entity to automate formal governance rules contained in corporate bylaws or imposed by law.” The White Paper proposes an entity—a DAO Entity—that would use smart contracts to attempt to solve governance issues it described as inherent in traditional corporations.footnote:idem[Id. ]] As described, a DAO Entity purportedly would supplant traditional mechanisms of corporate governance and management with a blockchain such that contractual terms are “formalized, automated and enforced using software.”footnote:[Id. The White Paper contained the following statement: [.quoteblock .text-justify]#++A word of caution, at the outset: the legal status of [DAO Entities] remains the subject of active and vigorous debate and discussion. Not everyone shares the same definition. Some have said that [DAO Entities] are autonomous code and can operate independently of legal systems; others have said that [DAO Entities] must be owned or operate[d] by humans or human created entities. There will be many use cases, and the DAO [Entity] code will develop over time. Ultimately, how a DAO [Entity] functions and its legal status will depend on many factors, including how DAO [Entity] code is used, where it is used, and who uses it. This paper does not speculate about the legal status of [DAO Entities] worldwide. This paper is not intended to offer legal advice or conclusions. Anyone who uses DAO [Entity] code will do so at their own risk.++# Id.]]


[upperalpha, start=2]
. [underline]#The DAO#

[.text-justify]
“The DAO” is the “first generation” implementation of the White Paper concept of a DAO Entity, and it began as an effort to create a “crowdfunding contract” to raise “funds to grow [a] company in the crypto space.”footnote:[Christoph Jentzsch, The History of the DAO and Lessons Learned, SLOCK.IT BLOG (Aug. 24, 2016), https://blog.slock.it/the-history-of-the-dao-and-lessons-learned-d06740f8cfa5#.5o62zo8uv. Although The DAO has been described as a “crowdfunding contract,” The DAO would not have met the requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding, adopted under Title III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act of 2012 (providing an exemption from registration for certain crowdfunding), because, among other things, it was not a broker-dealer or a funding portal registered with the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). See Regulation Crowdfunding: A Small Entity Compliance Guide for Issuers, SEC (Apr. 5, 2017), https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/secg/rccomplianceguide-051316.htm; Updated Investor Bulletin: Crowdfunding for Investors, SEC (May 10, 2017), https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/ib_crowdfunding-.html.]] In November 2015, at an Ethereum Developer Conference in London, Christoph Jentzsch described his proposal for The DAO as a “for-profit DAO [Entity],” where participants would send ETH (a virtual currency) to The DAO to purchase DAO Tokens, which would permit the participant to vote and entitle the participant to “rewards.”footnote:[See Slockit, Slock.it DAO demo at Devcon1: IoT + Blockchain, YOUTUBE (Nov. 13, 2015), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49wHQoJxYPo.]] Christoph Jentzsch likened this to “buying shares in a company and getting … dividends.”footnote:idem[]] The DAO was to be “decentralized” in that it would allow for voting by investors holding DAO Tokens.footnote:[See Jentzsch, supra note 8.]] All funds raised were to be held at an Ethereum Blockchain “address” associated with The DAO and DAO Token holders were to vote on contract proposals, including proposals to The DAO to fund projects and distribute The DAO’s anticipated earnings from the projects it
funded. footnote:[Id. In theory, there was no limitation on the type of project that could be proposed. For example, proposed “projects” could include, among other things, projects that would culminate in the creation of products or services that DAO Token holders could use or charge others for using.]] The DAO was intended to be “autonomous” in that project proposals were in the form of smart contracts that exist on the Ethereum Blockchain and the votes were administered by the code of The DAO.footnote:idem[]

[.text-justify]
On or about April 29, 2016, Slock.it deployed The DAO code on the Ethereum Blockchain, as a set of pre-programmed instructions.footnote:[++According to the White Paper, a DAO Entity is “activated by deployment on the Ethereum [B]lockchain. Once deployed, a [DAO Entity’s] code requires ‘ether’ [ETH] to engage in transactions on Ethereum. Ether is the digital  fuel that powers the Ethereum Network.” The only way to update or alter The DAO’s code is to submit a new proposal for voting and achieve a majority consensus on that proposal. See Jentzsch, supra note 8. According to Slock.it’s website, Slock.it gave The DAO code to the Ethereum community, noting that:++ [.quoteblock .text-justify]#++The DAO framework is [a] side project of Slock.it UG and a gift to the Ethereum community. It consisted of a definitive whitepaper, smart contract code audited by one of the best security companies in the world and soon, a complete frontend interface. All free and open source for anyone to re-use, it is our way to say ‘thank you’ to the community.++# SLOCK.IT, https://slock.it. The DAO code is publicly-available on GitHub, a host of source code. See The Standard
DAO Framework, Inc., Whitepaper, GITHUB, https://github.com/slockit/DAO.]] This code was to govern how The DAO was to operate.

[.text-justify]
To promote The DAO, Slock.it’s co-founders launched a website (“The DAO Website”). The DAO Website included a description of The DAO’s intended purpose: “To blaze a new path in business for the betterment of its members, existing simultaneously nowhere and everywhere and operating solely with the steadfast iron will of unstoppable code.”footnote:[The DAO Website was available at https://daohub.org.]] The DAO Website also described how The DAO operated, and included a link through which DAO Tokens could be purchased. The DAO Website also included a link to the White Paper, which provided detailed information about a DAO Entity’s structure and its source code and, together with The DAO Website, served as the primary source of promotional materials for The DAO. On The DAO Website and elsewhere, Slock.it represented that The DAO’s source code had been reviewed by “one of the world’s leading security audit companies” and “no stone was left unturned during those five whole days of security analysis.”footnote:[Stephen Tual, Deja Vu DAO Smart Contracts Audit Results, SLOCK.IT BLOG (Apr. 5, 2016), https://blog.slock.it/deja-vu-dai-smart-contracts-audit-results-d26bc088e32e.]

[.text-justify]
Slock.it’s co-founders also promoted The DAO by soliciting media attention and by posting almost daily updates on The DAO’s status on The DAO and Slock.it websites and numerous online forums relating to blockchain technology. Slock.it’s co-founders used these posts to communicate to the public information about how to participate in The DAO, including: how to create and acquire DAO Tokens; the framework for submitting proposals for projects; and how to vote on proposals. Slock.it also created an online forum on The DAO Website, as well as administered “The DAO Slack” channel, an online messaging platform in which over 5,000 invited “team members” could discuss and exchange ideas about The DAO in real time.

[start=1]
. _DAO Tokens_

[.text-justify]
In exchange for ETH, The DAO created DAO Tokens (proportional to the amount of ETH paid) that were then assigned to the Ethereum Blockchain address of the person or entity remitting the ETH. A DAO Token granted the DAO Token holder certain voting and ownership rights. According to promotional materials, The DAO would earn profits by funding projects that would provide DAO Token holders a return on investment. The various promotional materials disseminated by Slock.it’s co-founders touted that DAO Token holders would receive “rewards,” which the White Paper defined as, “any [ETH] received by a DAO [Entity] generated from projects the DAO [Entity] funded.” DAO Token holders would then vote to either use the rewards to fund new projects or to distribute the ETH to DAO Token holders.
[.text-justify]
From April 30, 2016 through May 28, 2016 (the “Offering Period”), The DAO offered and sold DAO Tokens. Investments in The DAO were made “pseudonymously” (i.e., an individual’s or entity’s pseudonym was their Ethereum Blockchain address). To purchase a DAO Token offered for sale by The DAO, an individual or entity sent ETH from their Ethereum Blockchain address to an Ethereum Blockchain address associated with The DAO. All of the ETH raised in the offering as well as any future profits earned by The DAO were to be pooled and held in The DAO’s Ethereum Blockchain address. The token price fluctuated in a range of approximately 1 to 1.5 ETH per 100 DAO Tokens, depending on when the tokens were purchased during the Offering Period.  Anyone was eligible to purchase DAO Tokens (as long as they paid ETH). There ere no limitations placed on the number of DAO Tokens offered for sale, the number of purchasers of DAO Tokens, or the level of sophistication of such purchasers. 
[.text-justify]
DAO Token holders were not restricted from re-selling DAO Tokens acquired in the offering, and DAO Token holders could sell their DAO Tokens in a variety of ways in the secondary market and thereby monetize their investment as discussed below. Prior to the Offering Period, Slock.it solicited at least one U.S. web-based platform to trade DAO Tokens on its system and, at the time of the offering, The DAO Website and other promotional materials disseminated by Slock.it included representations that DAO Tokens would be available for secondary market trading after the Offering Period via several platforms. During the Offering Period and afterwards, the Platforms posted notices on their own websites and on social media that each planned to support secondary market trading of DAO Tokens.footnote:[The Platforms are registered with FinCEN as “Money Services Businesses” and provide systems whereby customers may exchange virtual currencies for other virtual currencies or fiat currencies.]] In addition to secondary market trading on the Platforms, after the Offering Period, DAO Tokens were to be freely transferable on the Ethereum Blockchain. DAO Token holders would also be permitted to redeem their DAO Tokens for ETH through a complicated, multi-week (approximately 46-day) process referred to as a DAO Entity “split.”footnote:[According to the White Paper, the primary purpose of a split is to protect minority shareholders and prevent what is commonly referred to as a “51% Attack,” whereby an attacker holding 51% of a DAO Entity’s Tokens could create a proposal to send all of the DAO Entity’s funds to himself or herself.]

[start=2]
. _Participants in The DAO_

[.text-justify]
According to the White Paper, in order for a project to be considered for funding with “a DAO [Entity]’s [ETH],” a “Contractor” first must submit a proposal to the DAO Entity. Specifically, DAO Token holders expected Contractors to submit proposals for projects that could provide DAO Token holders returns on their investments. Submitting a proposal to The DAO involved: (1) writing a smart contract, and then deploying and publishing it on the Ethereum Blockchain; and (2) posting details about the proposal on The DAO Website, including the Ethereum Blockchain address of the deployed contract and a link to its source code. Proposals could be viewed on The DAO Website as well as other publicly-accessible websites. Per the White Paper, there were two prerequisites for submitting a proposal. An individual or entity must: (1) own at least one DAO Token; and (2) pay a deposit in the form of ETH that would be forfeited to the DAO Entity if the proposal was put up for a vote and failed to achieve a quorum of DAO Token holders. It was publicized that Slock.it would be the first to submit a proposal for funding.footnote:[It was stated on The DAO Website and elsewhere that Slock.it anticipated that it would be the first to submit a proposal for funding. In fact, a draft of Slock.it’s proposal for funding for an “Ethereum Computer and Universal Sharing Network” was publicly-available online during the Offering Period.]

[.text-justify]
ETH raised by The DAO was to be distributed to a Contractor to fund a proposal only on a majority vote of DAO Token holders.footnote:[DAO Token holders could vote on proposals, either by direct interaction with the Ethereum Blockchain or by using an application that interfaces with the Ethereum Blockchain. It was generally acknowledged that DAO Token holders needed some technical knowledge in order to submit a vote, and The DAO Website included a link to a step-by-step tutorial describing how to vote on proposals.]] DAO Token holders were to cast votes, which would be weighted by the number of tokens they controlled, for or against the funding of a specific proposal. The voting process, however, was publicly criticized in that it could incentivize distorted voting behavior and, as a result, would not accurately reflect the consensus of the majority of DAO Token holders. Specifically, as noted in a May 27, 2016 blog post by a group of computer security researchers, The DAO’s structure included a “strong positive bias to vote YES on proposals and to suppress NO votes as a side effect of the way in which it restricts users’ range of options following the casting of a vote.”footnote:[By voting on a proposal, DAO Token holders would “tie up” their tokens until the end of the voting cycle. See Jentzsch, supra note 8 at 8 ++(“The tokens used to vote will be blocked, meaning they can not [sic] be transferred until the proposal is closed.”)++. If, however, a DAO Token holder abstained from voting, the DAO Token holder could avoid these restrictions; any DAO Tokens not submitted for a vote could be withdrawn or transferred at any time. As a result, DAO Token holders were incentivized either to vote yes or to abstain from voting. See Dino Mark et al., A Call for a Temporary Moratorium on The DAO, HACKING, DISTRIBUTED (May 27, 2016, 1:35 PM), http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/05/27/dao-call-for-moratorium/.]]

[.text-justify]
Before any proposal was put to a vote by DAO Token holders, it was required to be reviewed by one or more of The DAO’s “Curators.” At the time of the formation of The DAO, the Curators were a group of individuals chosen by Slock.it.footnote:[At the time of The DAO’s launch, The DAO Website identified eleven “high profile” individuals as holders of The DAO’s Curator “Multisig” (or “private key”). These individuals all appear to live outside of the United States. Many of them were associated with the Ethereum Foundation, and The DAO Website touted the qualifications and trustworthiness of these individuals.]] According to the White Paper, the Curators of a DAO Entity had “considerable power.” The Curators performed crucial security functions and maintained ultimate control over which proposals could be submitted to, voted on, and funded by The DAO. As stated on The DAO Website during the Offering Period, The DAO relied on its Curators for “failsafe protection” and for protecting The DAO from “malicous [sic] actors.” Specifically, per The DAO Website, a Curator was responsible for: (1) confirming that any proposal for funding originated from an identifiable person or organization; and (2) confirming that smart contracts associated with any such proposal properly reflected the code the Contractor claims to have deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain. If a Curator determined that the proposal met these criteria, the Curator could add the proposal to the “whitelist,” which was a list of Ethereum Blockchain addresses that could receive ETH from The DAO if the majority of DAO Token holders voted for the proposal.
[.text-justify]
Curators of The DAO had ultimate discretion as to whether or not to submit a proposal for voting by DAO Token holders. Curators also determined the order and frequency of proposals, and could impose subjective criteria for whether the proposal should be whitelisted. One member of the group chosen by Slock.it to serve collectively as the Curator stated publicly that the Curator had “complete control over the whitelist … the order in which things get whitelisted, the duration for which [proposals] get whitelisted, when things get unwhitelisted … [and] clear ability to control the order and frequency of proposals,” noting that “curators have tremendous power.”footnote:[Epicenter, EB134 &#8212; Emin Gün Sirer And Vlad Zamfir: On A Rocky DAO, YOUTUBE (June 6, 2016), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON5GhIQdFU8.]] Another Curator publicly announced his subjective criteria for determining whether to whitelist a proposal, which included his personal ethics.footnote:[Andrew Quentson, Are the DAO Curators Masters or Janitors?, THE COIN TELEGRAPH (June 12, 2016),
https://cointelegraph.com/news/are-the-dao-curators-masters-or-janitors.] Per the White Paper, a Curator also had the power to reduce the voting quorum requirement by 50% every other week. Absent action by a Curator, the quorum could be reduced by 50% only if no proposal had reached the required quorum for 52 weeks.

[start=3]
. _Secondary Market Trading on the Platforms_

[.text-justify]
During the period from May 28, 2016 through early September 2016, the Platforms became the preferred vehicle for DAO Token holders to buy and sell DAO Tokens in the secondary market using virtual or fiat currencies. Specifically, the Platforms used electronic systems that allowed their respective customers to post orders for DAO Tokens on an anonymous basis. For example, customers of each Platform could buy or sell DAO Tokens by entering a market order on the Platform’s system, which would then match with orders from other customers residing on the system. Each Platform’s system would automatically execute these orders based on pre-programmed order interaction protocols established by the Platform.
[.text-justify]
None of the Platforms received orders for DAO Tokens from non-Platform customers or routed its respective customers’ orders to any other trading destinations. The Platforms publicly displayed all their quotes, trades, and daily trading volume in DAO Tokens on their respective websites. During the period from May 28, 2016 through September 6, 2016, one such Platform executed more than 557,378 buy and sell transactions in DAO Tokens by more than 15,000 of its U.S. and foreign customers. During the period from May 28, 2016 through August 1, 2016, another such Platform executed more than 22,207 buy and sell transactions in DAO Tokens by more than 700 of its U.S. customers.

[start=4]
. _Security Concerns, The “Attack” on The DAO, and The Hard Fork_

[.text-justify]
In late May 2016, just prior to the expiration of the Offering Period, concerns about the safety and security of The DAO’s funds began to surface due to vulnerabilities in The DAO’s code. On May 26, 2016, in response to these concerns, Slock.it submitted a “DAO Security Proposal” that called for the development of certain updates to The DAO’s code and the appointment of a security expert.footnote:[See Stephan Tual, Proposal #1-DAO Security, Redux, SLOCK.IT BLOG (May 26, 2016), https://blog.slock.it/bothour-proposals-are-now-out-voting-starts-saturday-morning-ba322d6d3aea. The unnamed security expert would “act as the first point of contact for security disclosures, and continually monitor, pre-empt and avert any potential attack
vectors The DAO may face, including social, technical and economic attacks.” Id. Slock.it initially proposed a
much broader security proposal that included the formation of a “DAO Security” group, the establishment of a “Bug
Bounty Program,” and routine external audits of The DAO’s code. However, the cost of the proposal (125,000
ETH), which would be paid from The DAO’s funds, was immediately criticized as too high and Slock.it decided
instead to submit the revised proposal described above. See Stephan Tual, DAO.Security, a Proposal to guarantee
the integrity of The DAO, SLOCK.IT BLOG (May 25, 2016), https://blog.slock.it/dao-security-a-proposal-toguarantee-the-integrity-of-the-dao-3473899ace9d.] Further, on June 3, 2016, Christoph Jentzsch, on behalf of Slock.it, proposed a moratorium on all proposals until alterations to The DAO’s code to fix vulnerabilities in The DAO’s code had been implemented.footnote:[See TheDAO Proposal_ID 5, ETHERSCAN, https://etherscan.io/token/thedao-proposal/5.]

[.text-justify]
On June 17, 2016, an unknown individual or group (the “Attacker”) began rapidly diverting ETH from The DAO, causing approximately 3.6 million ETH—1/3 of the total ETH raised by The DAO offering—to move from The DAO’s Ethereum Blockchain address to an Ethereum Blockchain address controlled by the Attacker (the “Attack”).footnote[See Stephan Tual, DAO Security Advisory: live updates, SLOCK.IT BLOG (June 17, 2016), https://blog.slock.it/daosecurity-advisory-live-updates-2a0a42a2d07b.] Although the diverted ETH was then held in an address controlled by the Attacker, the Attacker was prevented by The DAO’s code from moving the ETH from that address for 27 days.footnote:idem[]

[.text-justify]
In order to secure the diverted ETH and return it to DAO Token holders, Slock.it’s cofounders and others endorsed a “Hard Fork” to the Ethereum Blockchain. The “Hard Fork,” called for a change in the Ethereum protocol on a going forward basis that would restore the DAO Token holders’ investments as if the Attack had not occurred. On July 20, 2016, after a majority of the Ethereum network adopted the necessary software updates, the new, forked Ethereum Blockchain became active.footnote:[A minority group, however, elected not to adopt the new Ethereum Blockchain created by the Hard Fork because
to do so would run counter to the concept that a blockchain is immutable. Instead they continued to use the former
version of the blockchain, which is now known as “Ethereum Classic.”] The Hard Fork had the effect of transferring all of the funds raised (including those held by the Attacker) from The DAO to a recovery address, where DAO Token holders could exchange their DAO Tokens for ETH.footnote:[See Christoph Jentzsch, What the ‘Fork’ Really Means, SLOCK.IT BLOG (July 18, 2016), https://blog.slock.it/whatthe-fork-really-means-6fe573ac31dd.]] All DAO Token holders who adopted the Hard Fork could exchange their DAO Tokens for ETH, and avoid any loss of the ETH they had invested.footnote:idem[]

. *Discussion*

[.text-justify]
The Commission is aware that virtual organizations and associated individuals and entities increasingly are using distributed ledger technology to offer and sell instruments such as DAO Tokens to raise capital. These offers and sales have been referred to, among other things, as “Initial Coin Offerings” or “Token Sales.” Accordingly, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to issue this Report in order to stress that the U.S. federal securities law may apply to various activities, including distributed ledger technology, depending on the particular facts and circumstances, without regard to the form of the organization or technology used to effectuate a particular offer or sale. In this Report, the Commission considers the particular facts and circumstances of the offer and sale of DAO Tokens to demonstrate the application of existing U.S. federal securities laws to this new paradigm.

[.text-justify]
The registration provisions of the Securities Act contemplate that the offer or sale  securities to the public must be accompanied by the “full and fair disclosure” afforded by registration with the Commission and delivery of a statutory prospectus containing information necessary to enable prospective purchasers to make an informed investment decision. Registration entails disclosure of detailed “information about the issuer’s financial condition, the identity and background of management, and the price and amount of securities to be offered … .” SEC v. Cavanagh, 1 F. Supp. 2d 337, 360 (S.D.N.Y. 1998), aff’d, 155 F.3d 129 (2d Cir. 1998). “The registration statement is designed to assure public access to material facts bearing on the value of publicly traded securities and is central to the Act’s comprehensive scheme for protecting public investors.” SEC v. Aaron, 605 F.2d 612, 618 (2d Cir. 1979) (citing SEC v. Ralston Purina Co., 346 U.S. 119, 124 (1953)), vacated on other grounds, 446 U.S. 680 (1980). Section 5(a) of the Securities Act provides that, unless a registration statement is in effect as to a security, it is unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to engage in the offer or sale of securities in interstate commerce. Section 5(c) of the Securities Act provides a similar prohibition against offers to sell, or offers to buy, unless a registration statement has been filed. Thus, both Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act prohibit the unregistered offer or sale of securities in interstate commerce. 15 U.S.C. § 77e(a) and (c). Violations of Section 5 do not require scienter. SEC v. Universal Major Indus. Corp., 546 F.2d 1044, 1047 (2d Cir. 1976).

[.text-justify]
Under Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act, a security includes “an investment contract.” See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77b-77c. An investment contract is an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. See SEC v. Edwards, 540 U.S. 389, 393 (2004); SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 301 (1946); see also United Housing Found., Inc. v. Forman, 421 U.S. 837, 852-53 (1975) (The “touchstone” of an investment contract “is the presence of an investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.”). This definition embodies a “flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.” Howey, 328 U.S. at 299 (emphasis added). The test “permits the fulfillment of the statutory purpose of compelling full and fair disclosure relative to the issuance of ‘the many types of instruments that in our commercial world fall within the ordinary concept of a security.’” Id. In analyzing whether something is a security, “form should be disregarded for substance,” Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967), “and the emphasis should be on economic realities underlying a transaction, and not on the name appended thereto.” United Housing Found., 421 U.S. at 849.

[numeric, start=2]
.. _Investors in The DAO Invested Money_

[.text-justify]
In determining whether an investment contract exists, the investment of “money” need not take the form of cash. See, e.g., Uselton v. Comm. Lovelace Motor Freight, Inc., 940 F.2d 564, 574 (10th Cir. 1991) (“[I]n spite of Howey’s reference to an ‘investment of money,’ it is well established that cash is not the only form of contribution or investment that will create an investment contract.”).
[.text-justify]
Investors in The DAO used ETH to make their investments, and DAO Tokens were received in exchange for ETH. Such investment is the type of contribution of value that can create an investment contract under Howey. See SEC v. Shavers, No. 4:13-CV-416, 2014 WL 4652121, at *1 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 18, 2014) (holding that an investment of Bitcoin, a virtual currency, meets the first prong of Howey); Uselton, 940 F.2d at 574 (“[T]he ‘investment’ may take the form of ‘goods and services,’ or some other ‘exchange of value’.”) (citations omitted).

.. _With a Reasonable Expectation of Profits_

[.text-justify]
Investors who purchased DAO Tokens were investing in a common enterprise  reasonably expected to earn profits through that enterprise when they sent ETH to The DAO’s Ethereum Blockchain address in exchange for DAO Tokens. “[P]rofits” include “dividends, other periodic payments, or the increased value of the investment.” Edwards, 540 U.S. at 394. As described above, the various promotional materials disseminated by Slock.it and its cofounders informed investors that The DAO was a for-profit entity whose objective was to fund projects in exchange for a return on investment.footnote:[That the “projects” could encompass services and the creation of goods for use by DAO Token holders does not change the core analysis that investors purchased DAO Tokens with the expectation of earning profits from the efforts of others.]] The ETH was pooled and available to The DAO to fund projects. The projects (or “contracts”) would be proposed by Contractors. If the proposed contracts were whitelisted by Curators, DAO Token holders could vote on whether The DAO should fund the proposed contracts. Depending on the terms of each particular contract, DAO Token holders stood to share in potential profits from the contracts. Thus, a reasonable investor would have been motivated, at least in part, by the prospect of profits on their investment of ETH in The DAO.

.. _Derived from the Managerial Efforts of Others_

[loweralpha, start=1]
... The Efforts of Slock.it, Slock.it’s Co-Founders, and The DAO’s Curators Were Essential to the Enterprise

[.text-justify]
Investors’ profits were to be derived from the managerial efforts of others—specifically, Slock.it and its co-founders, and The DAO’s Curators. The central issue is “whether the efforts made by those other than the investor are the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise.” SEC v. Glenn W. Turner Enters., Inc., 474 F.2d 476, 482 (9th Cir. 1973). The DAO’s investors relied on the managerial and entrepreneurial efforts of Slock.it and its co-founders, and The DAO’s Curators, to manage The DAO and put forth project proposals that could generate profits for The DAO’s investors. 
[.text-justify]
Investors’ expectations were primed by the marketing of The DAO and active engagement between Slock.it and its co-founders with The DAO and DAO Token holders. To market The DAO and DAO Tokens, Slock.it created The DAO Website on which it published the White Paper explaining how a DAO Entity would work and describing their vision for a DAO Entity. Slock.it also created and maintained other online forums that it used to provide information to DAO Token holders about how to vote and perform other tasks related to their investment. Slock.it appears to have closely monitored these forums, answering questions from DAO Token holders about a variety of topics, including the future of The DAO, security concerns, ground rules for how The DAO would work, and the anticipated role of DAO Token holders. The creators of The DAO held themselves out to investors as experts in Ethereum, the blockchain protocol on which The DAO operated, and told investors that they had selected persons to serve as Curators based on their expertise and credentials. Additionally, Slock.it told investors that it expected to put forth the first substantive profit-making contract proposal—a blockchain venture in its area of expertise. Through their conduct and marketing materials, Slock.it and its co-founders led investors to believe that they could be relied on to provide the significant managerial efforts required to make The DAO a success.
[.text-justify]
Investors in The DAO reasonably expected Slock.it and its co-founders, and The DAO’s Curators, to provide significant managerial efforts after The DAO’s launch. The expertise of The DAO’s creators and Curators was critical in monitoring the operation of The DAO, safeguarding investor funds, and determining whether proposed contracts should be put for a vote. Investors had little choice but to rely on their expertise. At the time of the offering, The DAO’s protocols had already been pre-determined by Slock.it and its co-founders, including the control that could be exercised by the Curators. Slock.it and its co-founders chose the Curators, whose function it was to: (1) vet Contractors; (2) determine whether and when to submit proposals for votes; (3) determine the order and frequency of proposals that were submitted for a vote; and (4) determine whether to halve the default quorum necessary for a successful vote on certain proposals. Thus, the Curators exercised significant control over the order and frequency of proposals, and could impose their own subjective criteria for whether the proposal should be whitelisted for a vote by DAO Token holders. DAO Token holders’ votes were limited to proposals whitelisted by the Curators, and, although any DAO Token holder could put forth a proposal, each proposal would follow the same protocol, which included vetting and control by the current Curators. While DAO Token holders could put forth proposals to replace a Curator, such proposals were subject to control by the current Curators, including whitelisting and approval of the new address to which the tokens would be directed for such a proposal. In essence, Curators had the power to determine whether a proposal to remove a Curator was put to a vote.footnote:[DAO Token holders could put forth a proposal to split from The DAO, which would result in the creation of a new DAO Entity with a new Curator. Other DAO Token holders would be allowed to join the new DAO Entity as long as they voted yes to the original “split” proposal. Unlike all other contract proposals, a proposal to split did not require a deposit or a quorum, and it required a seven-day debating period instead of the minimum two-week debating period required for other proposals.]

[.text-justify]
And, Slock.it and its co-founders did, in fact, actively oversee The DAO. They monitored The DAO closely and addressed issues as they arose, proposing a moratorium on all proposals until vulnerabilities in The DAO’s code had been addressed and a security expert to monitor potential attacks on The DAO had been appointed. When the Attacker exploited a weakness in the code and removed investor funds, Slock.it and its co-founders stepped in to help resolve the situation.

[loweralpha, start=2]
... DAO Token Holders’ Voting Rights Were Limited

[.text-justify]
Although DAO Token holders were afforded voting rights, these voting rights were limited. DAO Token holders were substantially reliant on the managerial efforts of Slock.it, its co-founders, and the Curators. footnote:[Because, as described above, DAO Token holders were incentivized either to vote yes or to abstain from voting,
the results of DAO Token holder voting would not necessarily reflect the actual view of a majority of DAO Token
holders.] Even if an investor’s efforts help to make an enterprise profitable, those efforts do not necessarily equate with a promoter’s significant managerial efforts or control over the enterprise. See, e.g., Glenn W. Turner, 474 F.2d at 482 (finding that a multi-level marketing scheme was an investment contract and that investors relied on the promoter’s managerial efforts, despite the fact that investors put forth the majority of the labor that made the enterprise profitable, because the promoter dictated the terms and controlled the scheme itself); Long v. Shultz, 881 F.2d 129, 137 (5th Cir. 1989) (“An investor may authorize the assumption of particular risks that would create the possibility of greater profits or losses but still depend on a third party for all of the essential managerial efforts without which the risk could not pay off.”). See also generally SEC v. Merchant Capital, LLC, 483 F.3d 747 (11th Cir. 2007) (finding an investment contract even where voting rights were provided to purported general partners, noting that the voting process provided limited information for investors to make informed decisions, and the purported general partners lacked control over the information in the ballots).
[.text-justify]
The voting rights afforded DAO Token holders did not provide them with meaningful control over the enterprise, because (1) DAO Token holders’ ability to vote for contracts was a largely perfunctory one; and (2) DAO Token holders were widely dispersed and limited in their ability to communicate with one another.
[.text-justify]
First, as discussed above, DAO Token holders could only vote on proposals that had been cleared by the Curators.footnote:[Because, in part, The DAO never commenced its business operations funding projects, this Report does not
analyze the question whether anyone associated with The DAO was an ++“[i]nvestment adviser”++ under Section
202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). See 15 U.S.C. § 80b-2(a)(11). Those who
would use virtual organizations should consider their obligations under the Advisers Act.] And that clearance process did not include any mechanism to provide DAO Token holders with sufficient information to permit them to make informed voting decisions. Indeed, based on the particular facts concerning The DAO and the few draft proposals discussed in online forums, there are indications that contract proposals would not have necessarily provide enough information for investors to make an informed voting decision, affording them less meaningful control. For example, the sample contract proposal attached to the White Paper included little information concerning the terms of the contract. Also, the Slock.it co-founders put forth a draft of their own contract proposal and, in response to questions and requests to negotiate the terms of the proposal (posted to a DAO forum), a Slock.it founder explained that the proposal was intentionally vague and that it was, in essence, a take it or leave it proposition not subject to negotiation or feedback. See, e.g., SEC v. Shields, 744 F.3d 633, 643-45 (10th Cir. 2014) (in assessing whether agreements were investment contracts, court looked to whether “the investors actually had the type of control reserved under the agreements to obtain access to information necessary to protect, manage, and control their investments at the time they purchased their interests.”).
[.text-justify]
Second, the pseudonymity and dispersion of the DAO Token holders made it difficult for them to join together to effect change or to exercise meaningful control. Investments in The DAO were made pseudonymously (such that the real-world identities of investors are not apparent), and there was great dispersion among those individuals and/or entities who were invested in The DAO and thousands of individuals and/or entities that traded DAO Tokens in the secondary market—an arrangement that bears little resemblance to that of a genuine general partnership. Cf. Williamson v. Tucker, 645 F.2d 404, 422-24 (5th Cir. 1981) (“[O]ne would not expect partnership interests sold to large numbers of the general public to provide any real partnership control; at some point there would be so many [limited] partners that a partnership vote would be more like a corporate vote, each partner’s role having been diluted to the level of a single shareholder in a corporation.”).footnote:[The Fifth Circuit in Williamson stated that: [.quoteblock .text-justify]#A general partnership or joint venture interest can be designated a security if the investor can establish, for example, that (1) an agreement among the parties leaves so little power in the hands of the partner or venture that the arrangement in fact distributes power as would a limited partnership; or (2) the partner or venturer is so inexperienced and unknowledgeable in business affairs that he is incapable of intelligently exercising his partnership or venture powers; or (3) the partner or venturer is so dependent on some unique entrepreneurial or managerial ability of the promoter or manager that he cannot replace the manager of the enterprise or otherwise exercise meaningful partnership or venture powers.# Williamson, 645 F.2d at 424 & n.15 (court also noting that, “this is not to say that other factors could not also give rise to such a dependence on the promoter or manager that the exercise of partnership powers would be effectively precluded.”).]] Slock.it did create and maintain online forums on which investors could submit posts regarding contract proposals, which were not limited to use by DAO Token holders (anyone was permitted to post). However, DAO Token holders were pseudonymous, as were their posts to the forums. Those facts, combined with the sheer number of DAO Token holders, potentially made the forums of limited use if investors hoped to consolidate their votes into blocs powerful enough to assert actual control. This was later demonstrated through the fact that DAO Token holders were unable to effectively address the Attack without the assistance of Slock.it and others. The DAO Token holders’ pseudonymity and dispersion diluted their control over The DAO. See Merchant Capital, 483 F.3d at 758 (finding geographic dispersion of investors weighing against investor control).
[.text-justify]
These facts diminished the ability of DAO Token holders to exercise meaningful control over the enterprise through the voting process, rendering the voting rights of DAO Token holders akin to those of a corporate shareholder. Steinhardt Group, Inc. v. Citicorp., 126 F.3d 144, 152 (3d Cir. 1997) (“It must be emphasized that the assignment of nominal or limited responsibilities to the participant does not negate the existence of an investment contract; where the duties
assigned are so narrowly circumscribed as to involve little real choice of action … a security may be found to exist … . [The] emphasis must be placed on economic reality.”) (citing SEC v. Koscot Interplanetary, Inc., 497 F.2d 473, 483 n. 14 (5th Cir. 1974)).
[.text-justify]
By contract and in reality, DAO Token holders relied on the significant managerial efforts provided by Slock.it and its co-founders, and The DAO’s Curators, as described above. Their efforts, not those of DAO Token holders, were the “undeniably significant” ones, essential to the overall success and profitability of any investment into The DAO. See Glenn W. Turner, 474 F.2d at 482.

.. [underline]#Issuers Must Register Offers and Sales of Securities Unless a Valid Exemption Applies#

[.text-justify]
The definition of “issuer” is broadly defined to include “every person who issues or proposes to issue any security” and “person” includes “any unincorporated organization.” 15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(4). The term “issuer” is flexibly construed in the Section 5 context “as issuers devise new ways to issue their securities and the definition of a security itself expands.” Doran v. Petroleum Mgmt. Corp., 545 F.2d 893, 909 (5th Cir. 1977); accord SEC v. Murphy, 626 F.2d 633, 644 (9th Cir. 1980) (“[W]hen a person [or entity] organizes or sponsors the organization of limited partnerships and is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the venture for which the partnership is formed, he will be considered an issuer … .”).
[.text-justify]
The DAO, an unincorporated organization, was an issuer of securities, and information about The DAO was “crucial” to the DAO Token holders’ investment decision. See Murphy, 626 F.2d at 643 (“Here there is no company issuing stock, but instead, a group of individuals investing funds in an enterprise for profit, and receiving in return an entitlement to a percentage of the proceeds of the enterprise.”) (citation omitted). The DAO was “responsible for the success or failure of the enterprise,” and accordingly was the entity about which the investors needed information material to their investment decision. Id. at 643-44. During the Offering Period, The DAO offered and sold DAO Tokens in exchange for ETH through The DAO Website, which was publicly-accessible, including to individuals in the United States. During the Offering Period, The DAO sold approximately 1.15 billion DAO Tokens in exchange for a total of approximately 12 million ETH, which was valued in USD, at the time, at approximately $150 million. Because DAO Tokens were securities, The DAO was required to register the offer and sale of DAO Tokens, unless a valid exemption from such registration applied.
[.text-justify]
Moreover, those who participate in an unregistered offer and sale of securities not subject to a valid exemption are liable for violating Section 5. See, e.g., Murphy, 626 F.2d at 650-51 (“[T]hose who ha[ve] a necessary role in the transaction are held liable as participants.”) (citing SEC v. North Am. Research & Dev. Corp., 424 F.2d 63, 81 (2d Cir. 1970); SEC v. Culpepper, 270 F.2d 241, 247 (2d Cir. 1959); SEC v. International Chem. Dev. Corp., 469 F.2d 20, 28 (10th Cir. 1972); Pennaluna & Co. v. SEC, 410 F.2d 861, 864 n.1, 868 (9th Cir. 1969)); SEC v. Softpoint, Inc., 958 F. Supp 846, 859-60 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (“The prohibitions of Section 5 … sweep[] broadly to encompass ‘any person’ who participates in the offer or sale of an unregistered, non-exempt security.”); SEC v. Chinese Consol. Benevolent Ass’n., 120 F.2d 738, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1941) (defendant violated Section 5(a) “because it engaged in selling unregistered securities” issued by a third party “when it solicited offers to buy the securities ‘for value’”).

Section 5 of the Exchange Act makes it unlawful for any broker, dealer, or exchange, directly or indirectly, to effect any transaction in a security, or to report any such transaction, in interstate commerce, unless the exchange is registered as a national securities exchange under Section 6 of the Exchange Act, or is exempted from such registration. See 15 U.S.C. §78e. Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act defines an “exchange” as “any organization, association, or group of persons, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which constitutes, maintains, or provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood … .” 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(1). Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) provides a functional test to assess whether a trading system meets the definition of exchange under Section 3(a)(1). Under Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a), an organization, association, or group of persons shall be considered to constitute, maintain, or provide “a marketplace or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange,” if such organization, association, or group of persons: (1) brings together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers; and (2) uses established, non-discretionary methods (whether by providing a trading facility or by setting rules) under which such orders interact with each other, and the buyers and sellers entering such orders agree to the terms of the trade.footnote:[See 17 C.F.R. § 240.3b-16(a). The Commission adopted Rule 3b-16(b) to exclude explicitly certain systems that the Commission believed did not meet the exchange definition. These systems include systems that merely route orders to other execution facilities and systems that allow persons to enter orders for execution against the bids and offers of a single dealer system. See Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 40760 (Dec. 8, 1998), 63 FR 70844 (Dec. 22, 1998) (Regulation of Exchanges and Alternative Trading Systems) (“Regulation ATS”), 70852.]] A system that meets the criteria of Rule 3b-16(a), and is not excluded under Rule 3b16(b), must register as a national securities exchange pursuant to Sections 5 and 6 of the Exchange Act footnote:[15 U.S.C. § 78e. A “national securities exchange” is an exchange registered as such under Section 6 of the Exchange Act. 15 U.S.C. § 78f.]] or operate pursuant to an appropriate exemption. One frequently used exemption is for alternative trading systems (“ATS”).footnote:[Rule 300(a) of Regulation ATS promulgated under the Exchange Act provides that an ATS is: [.quoteblock .text-justify]#++any organization, association, person, group of persons, or system: (1) [t]hat constitutes, maintains, or provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange within the meaning of [Exchange Act Rule 3b-16]; and (2) [t]hat does not: (i) [s]et rules governing the conduct of subscribers other than the conduct of subscribers’ trading on such [ATS]; or (ii) [d]iscipline subscribers other than by exclusion from trading.++# Regulation ATS, supra note 40, Rule 300(a).]] Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) exempts from the definition of “exchange” under Section 3(a)(1) an ATS that complies with Regulation ATS,footnote:[See 17 C.F.R. § 240.3a1-1(a)(2). Rule 3a1-1 also provides two other exemptions from the definition of “exchange” for any ATS operated by a national securities association, and any ATS not required to comply with Regulation ATS pursuant to Rule 301(a) of Regulation ATS. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.3a1-1(a)(1) and (3).]] which includes, among other things, the requirement to register as a broker-dealer and file a Form ATS with the Commission to provide notice of the ATS’s operations. Therefore, an ATS that operates pursuant to the Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) exemption and complies with Regulation ATS would not be subject to the registration requirement of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.

. *Conclusion and References for Additional Guidance*

[.text-justify]
Whether or not a particular transaction involves the offer and sale of a security— regardless of the terminology used—will depend on the facts and circumstances, including the economic realities of the transaction. Those who offer and sell securities in the United States must comply with the federal securities laws, including the requirement to register with the Commission or to qualify for an exemption from the registration requirements of the federal
securities laws. The registration requirements are designed to provide investors with procedural protections and material information necessary to make informed investment decisions. These requirements apply to those who offer and sell securities in the United States, regardless whether the issuing entity is a traditional company or a decentralized autonomous organization, regardless whether those securities are purchased using U.S. dollars or virtual currencies, and regardless whether they are distributed in certificated form or through distributed ledger technology. In addition, any entity or person engaging in the activities of an exchange, such as bringing together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers using established nondiscretionary methods under which such orders interact with each other and buyers and sellers entering such orders agree upon the terms of the trade, must register as a national securities exchange or operate pursuant to an exemption from such registration.

*Remarks at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit: Crypto*

Thank you Andy. I am pleased to be here today. This event provides a great opportunity to address a topic that is the subject of considerable debate in the press and in the crypto-community -- whether a digital asset offered as a security can, over time, become something other than a security.

To start, we should frame the question differently and focus not on the digital asset itself, but on the circumstances surrounding the digital asset and the manner in which it is sold. To that end, a better line of inquiry is: “Can a digital asset that was originally offered in a securities offering ever be later sold in a manner that does not constitute an offering of a security?” In cases where the digital asset represents a set of rights that gives the holder a financial interest in an enterprise, the answer is likely “no.” In these cases, calling the transaction an initial coin offering, or “ICO,” or a sale of a “token,” will not take it out of the purview of the U.S. securities laws.

But what about cases where there is no longer any central enterprise being invested in or where the digital asset is sold only to be used to purchase a good or service available through the network on which it was created? I believe in these cases the answer is a qualified “yes.” I would like to share my thinking with you today about the circumstances under which that could occur.

Before I turn to the securities law analysis, let me share what I believe may be most exciting about distributed ledger technology -- that is, the potential to share information, transfer value, and record transactions in a decentralized digital environment. Potential applications include supply chain management, intellectual property rights licensing, stock ownership transfers and countless others. There is real value in creating applications that can be accessed and executed electronically with a public, immutable record and without the need for a trusted third party to verify transactions. Some people believe that this technology will transform e-commerce as we know it. There is excitement and a great deal of speculative interest around this new technology. Unfortunately, there also are cases of fraud. In many regards, it is still “early days.”

But I am not here to discuss the promise of technology -- there are many in attendance and speaking here today that can do a much better job of that. I would like to focus on the application of the federal securities laws to digital asset transactions -- that is how tokens and coins are being issued, distributed and sold. While perhaps a bit dryer than the promise of the blockchain, this topic is critical to the broader acceptance and use of these novel instruments.

I will begin by describing what I often see. Promoters, in order to raise money to develop networks on which digital assets will operate, often sell the tokens or coins rather than sell shares, issue notes or obtain bank financing. But, in many cases, the economic substance is the same as a conventional securities offering. Funds are raised with the expectation that the promoters will build their system and investors can earn a return on the instrument -- usually by selling their tokens in the secondary market once the promoters create something of value with the proceeds and the value of the digital enterprise increases.

When we see that kind of economic transaction, it is easy to apply the Supreme Court's “investment contract” test first announced in SEC v. Howey. That test requires an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others. And it is important to reflect on the facts of Howey. A hotel operator sold interests in a citrus grove to its guests and claimed it was selling real estate, not securities. While the transaction was recorded as a real estate sale, it also included a service contract to cultivate and harvest the oranges. The purchasers could have arranged to service the grove themselves but, in fact, most were passive, relying on the efforts of Howey-in-the-Hills Service, Inc. for a return. In articulating the test for an investment contract, the Supreme Court stressed: “Form [is] disregarded for substance and the emphasis [is] placed upon economic reality.” So the purported real estate purchase was found to be an investment contract -- an investment in orange groves was in these circumstances an investment in a security.

Just as in the Howey case, tokens and coins are often touted as assets that have a use in their own right, coupled with a promise that the assets will be cultivated in a way that will cause them to grow in value, to be sold later at a profit. And, as in Howey -- where interests in the groves were sold to hotel guests, not farmers -- tokens and coins typically are sold to a wide audience rather than to persons who are likely to use them on the network.

In the ICOs I have seen, overwhelmingly, promoters tout their ability to create an innovative application of blockchain technology. Like in Howey, the investors are passive. Marketing efforts are rarely narrowly targeted to token users. And typically at the outset, the business model and very viability of the application is still uncertain. The purchaser usually has no choice but to rely on the efforts of the promoter to build the network and make the enterprise a success. At that stage, the purchase of a token looks a lot like a bet on the success of the enterprise and not the purchase of something used to exchange for goods or services on the network.

As an aside, you might ask, given that these token sales often look like securities offerings, why are the promoters choosing to package the investment as a coin or token offering? This is an especially good question if the network on which the token or coin will function is not yet operational. I think there can be a number of reasons. For a while, some believed such labeling might, by itself, remove the transaction from the securities laws. I think people now realize labeling an investment opportunity as a coin or token does not achieve that result. Second, this labeling might have been used to bring some marketing “sizzle” to the enterprise. That might still work to some extent, but the track record of ICOs is still being sorted out and some of that sizzle may now be more of a potential warning flare for investors.

Some may be attracted to a blockchain-mediated crowdfunding process. Digital assets can represent an efficient way to reach a global audience where initial purchasers have a stake in the success of the network and become part of a network where their participation adds value beyond their investment contributions. The digital assets are then exchanged -- for some, to help find the market price for the new application; for others, to speculate on the venture. As I will discuss, whether a transaction in a coin or token on the secondary market amounts to an offer or sale of a security requires a careful and fact-sensitive legal analysis.

I believe some industry participants are beginning to realize that, in some circumstances, it might be easier to start a blockchain-based enterprise in a more conventional way. In other words, conduct the initial funding through a registered or exempt equity or debt offering and, once the network is up and running, distribute or offer blockchain-based tokens or coins to participants who need the functionality the network and the digital assets offer. This allows the tokens or coins to be structured and offered in a way where it is evident that purchasers are not making an investment in the development of the enterprise.

Returning to the ICOs I am seeing, strictly speaking, the token -- or coin or whatever the digital information packet is called -- all by itself is not a security, just as the orange groves in Howey were not. Central to determining whether a security is being sold is how it is being sold and the reasonable expectations of purchasers. When someone buys a housing unit to live in, it is probably not a security. But under certain circumstances, the same asset can be offered and sold in a way that causes investors to have a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others. For example, if the housing unit is offered with a management contract or other services, it can be a security. Similarly, when a CD, exempt from being treated as a security under Section 3 of the Securities Act, is sold as a part of a program organized by a broker who offers retail investors promises of liquidity and the potential to profit from changes in interest rates, the Gary Plastic case teaches us that the instrument can be part of an investment contract that is a security.

The same reasoning applies to digital assets. The digital asset itself is simply code. But the way it is sold -- as part of an investment; to non-users; by promoters to develop the enterprise -- can be, and, in that context, most often is, a security -- because it evidences an investment contract. And regulating these transactions as securities transactions makes sense. The impetus of the Securities Act is to remove the information asymmetry between promoters and investors. In a public distribution, the Securities Act prescribes the information investors need to make an informed investment decision, and the promoter is liable for material misstatements in the offering materials. These are important safeguards, and they are appropriate for most ICOs. The disclosures required under the federal securities laws nicely complement the Howey investment contract element about the efforts of others. As an investor, the success of the enterprise -- and the ability to realize a profit on the investment -- turns on the efforts of the third party. So learning material information about the third party -- its background, financing, plans, financial stake and so forth -- is a prerequisite to making an informed investment decision. Without a regulatory framework that promotes disclosure of what the third party alone knows of these topics and the risks associated with the venture, investors will be uninformed and are at risk.

But this also points the way to when a digital asset transaction may no longer represent a security offering. If the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized -- where purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts -- the assets may not represent an investment contract. Moreover, when the efforts of the third party are no longer a key factor for determining the enterprise's success, material information asymmetries recede. As a network becomes truly decentralized, the ability to identify an issuer or promoter to make the requisite disclosures becomes difficult, and less meaningful.

And so, when I look at Bitcoin today, I do not see a central third party whose efforts are a key determining factor in the enterprise. The network on which Bitcoin functions is operational and appears to have been decentralized for some time, perhaps from inception. Applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to the offer and resale of Bitcoin would seem to add little value. And putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. And, as with Bitcoin, applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to current transactions in Ether would seem to add little value. Over time, there may be other sufficiently decentralized networks and systems where regulating the tokens or coins that function on them as securities may not be required. And of course there will continue to be systems that rely on central actors whose efforts are a key to the success of the enterprise. In those cases, application of the securities laws protects the investors who purchase the tokens or coins.

I would like to emphasize that the analysis of whether something is a security is not static and does not strictly inhere to the instrument. Even digital assets with utility that function solely as a means of exchange in a decentralized network could be packaged and sold as an investment strategy that can be a security. If a promoter were to place Bitcoin in a fund or trust and sell interests, it would create a new security. Similarly, investment contracts can be made out of virtually any asset (including virtual assets), provided the investor is reasonably expecting profits from the promoter's efforts.

Let me emphasize an earlier point: simply labeling a digital asset a “utility token” does not turn the asset into something that is not a security. I recognize that the Supreme Court has acknowledged that if someone is purchasing an asset for consumption only, it is likely not a security. But, the economic substance of the transaction always determines the legal analysis, not the labels. The oranges in Howey had utility. Or in my favorite example, the Commission warned in the late 1960s about investment contracts sold in the form of whisky warehouse receipts. Promoters sold the receipts to U.S. investors to finance the aging and blending processes of Scotch whisky. The whisky was real -- and, for some, had exquisite utility. But Howey was not selling oranges and the warehouse receipts promoters were not selling whisky for consumption. They were selling investments, and the purchasers were expecting a return from the promoters' efforts.

Promoters and other market participants need to understand whether transactions in a particular digital asset involve the sale of a security. We are happy to help promoters and their counsel work through these issues. We stand prepared to provide more formal interpretive or no-action guidance about the proper characterization of a digital asset in a proposed use. In addition, we recognize that there are numerous implications under the federal securities laws of a particular asset being considered a security. For example, our Divisions of Trading and Markets and Investment Management are focused on such issues as broker-dealer, exchange and fund registration, as well as matters of market manipulation, custody and valuation. We understand that market participants are working to make their services compliant with the existing regulatory framework, and we are happy to continue our engagement in this process.

What are some of the factors to consider in assessing whether a digital asset is offered as an investment contract and is thus a security? Primarily, consider whether a third party -- be it a person, entity or coordinated group of actors -- drives the expectation of a return. That question will always depend on the particular facts and circumstances, and this list is illustrative, not exhaustive:

    . Is there a person or group that has sponsored or promoted the creation and sale of the digital asset, the efforts of whom play a significant role in the development and maintenance of the asset and its potential increase in value?
    . Has this person or group retained a stake or other interest in the digital asset such that it would be motivated to expend efforts to cause an increase in value in the digital asset? Would purchasers reasonably believe such efforts will be undertaken and may result in a return on their investment in the digital asset?
    . Has the promoter raised an amount of funds in excess of what may be needed to establish a functional network, and, if so, has it indicated how those funds may be used to support the value of the tokens or to increase the value of the enterprise? Does the promoter continue to expend funds from proceeds or operations to enhance the functionality and/or value of the system within which the tokens operate?
    . Are purchasers “investing,” that is seeking a return? In that regard, is the instrument marketed and sold to the general public instead of to potential users of the network for a price that reasonably correlates with the market value of the good or service in the network?
    . Does application of the Securities Act protections make sense? Is there a person or entity others are relying on that plays a key role in the profit-making of the enterprise such that disclosure of their activities and plans would be important to investors? Do informational asymmetries exist between the promoters and potential purchasers/investors in the digital asset?
    . Do persons or entities other than the promoter exercise governance rights or meaningful influence?

While these factors are important in analyzing the role of any third party, there are contractual or technical ways to structure digital assets so they function more like a consumer item and less like a security. Again, we would look to the economic substance of the transaction, but promoters and their counsels should consider these, and other, possible features. This list is not intended to be exhaustive and by no means do I believe each and every one of these factors needs to be present to establish a case that a token is not being offered as a security. This list is meant to prompt thinking by promoters and their counsel, and start the dialogue with the staff -- it is not meant to be a list of all necessary factors in a legal analysis.

. Is token creation commensurate with meeting the needs of users or, rather, with feeding speculation?
. Are independent actors setting the price or is the promoter supporting the secondary market for the asset or otherwise influencing trading?
. Is it clear that the primary motivation for purchasing the digital asset is for personal use or consumption, as compared to investment? Have purchasers made representations as to their consumptive, as opposed to their investment, intent? Are the tokens available in increments that correlate with a consumptive versus investment intent?
. Are the tokens distributed in ways to meet users' needs? For example, can the tokens be held or transferred only in amounts that correspond to a purchaser's expected use? Are there built-in incentives that compel using the tokens promptly on the network, such as having the tokens degrade in value over time, or can the tokens be held for extended periods for investment?
. Is the asset marketed and distributed to potential users or the general public?
. Are the assets dispersed across a diverse user base or concentrated in the hands of a few that can exert influence over the application?
. Is the application fully functioning or in early stages of development?


These are exciting legal times and I am pleased to be part of a process that can help promoters of this new technology and their counsel navigate and comply with the federal securities laws.

==== Discussion Questions ====

. Bill Hinman stated that he wanted to discuss whether "a digital asset offered as a security can, over time, become something other than a security." Is a digital asset a security under the Howey test, or is it the offer that is the investment contract under the Howey test? In Howey, the oranges are not an investment contract, but the offer to sell the orange groves was an investment contract when combined with the maintenance contract.

[underline]#**MEMORANDUM AND ORDER**#

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contends that LBRY, Inc. offered and sold unregistered securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. LBRY responds that it does not need to comply with the Securities Act because its alleged security, a blockchain token called LBC, is not a security at all. Instead, it argues that LBC functions as a digital currency that is an essential component of the LBRY Blockchain. LBRY also asserts that the SEC's attempt to treat LBC as a security violates its right to due process because the agency did not give LBRY fair notice that its offerings of LBC are subject to the securities laws. The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment addressing both issues

*I&#46; [underline]#BACKGROUND#*
[.text-justify]
The nascent technology known as blockchain operates in the background of this dispute. From its earliest days, proponents of blockchain technology have envisioned it as fundamentally altering many aspects of modern life. See Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (2008), https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf[] (outlining the idea for a peer-to-peer electronic payment system). As LBRY explains, a blockchain is essentially a “decentralized ledger maintained by a network of independently owned computers.” See Kauffman Decl., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Doc. No. 61-3] at 2 ¶ 5. Verified data is held in decentralized “block[s]” linked together via cryptographic consensus protocols. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[id.] at 2 ¶ 9. New data is connected to previous blocks, forming a chain. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[id.] at 2 ¶ 6. Digital tokens are used to compensate “miners” who validate transactions and allow for peer-to-peer “transfers of value,” which are then logged in the decentralized ledger. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[id.] at 2 ¶¶ 6, 9; see also link:https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I31dd31c0c1a211e491e799abcaf7f975/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_999_1[Morici v.

*2 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 27, 2015)] (further discussing the technical details of “mining”).  

A. The Development of the LBRY Network

[.text-justify]
LBRY began as an effort to harness blockchain technology to allow users to share videos, images, and other digital content without a centralized host such as YouTube. [underline]#See# Def.'s Mem., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791680[Doc. No. 61-1] at 3. LBRY asserts that its LBRY Network is “the first decentralized, open-source, fully encrypted content distribution service built using the same blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin.” [underline]#See# Introducing LBRY: The Bitcoin of Content, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791688[Doc. No. 61-9] at 1. The LBRY Network is comprised of three components: “(1) the LBRY Blockchain, (2) the LBRY Data Network, and (3) the applications layer[.]” Kauffman Decl., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Doc. No. 61-3] at 3 ¶ 11. LBRY developed the “LBRY Desktop Application” to run on the LBRY Network.  link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Id.] at 9 ¶ 26. LBRY has also developed other applications to run on the network, as have other thirdparty developers. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Id.] at 4 ¶ 11. LBRY Credits, or LBC, is the native digital token of the LBRY Blockchain. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Id.] at 4 ¶ 12. It is used to compensate miners, but it can also be spent on the LBRY Blockchain to publish content, create “channel[s]” that associate content with a single user, tip content creators, purchase paywall content, or “boost[]” channels or content in search results. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[id.] at 5-6 ¶ 17. Users generally must pay a fee in LBC in order to “interact with the LBRY Network for anything beyond viewing free content.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Id.] at 4 ¶ 12. 

[.text-justify]
The LBRY Network was designed to eventually have a circulation of approximately 1 billion LBC. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[id.] at 4 ¶ 13. Most of the LBC will be released in the future to compensate miners, but when the LBRY Blockchain launched in June 2016, LBRY reserved a “pre-mine” of 400 million LBC for itself. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[id.] at 5-6 ¶¶ 14-15; [underline]#see also# Kauffman Dep., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792048[Doc. No. 62-20] at 5. It then sorted its LBC into three buckets: (1) 200 million into a “Community Fund,” to be used for “spreading usage and adoption” of the Network by “rewarding early adopters,” “recruiting producers,” and “rewarding contributors to the community”; (2) 100 million into an “Institutional Fund,” to allow for “the formation of institutional partnerships, as well as for grants and donations to nonprofits and other [NGOs] with similar values as LBRY”; and (3) 100 million into the aptly named “Operational Fund,” to be used for “operational purposes.” [underline]#See# Kauffman Decl., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Doc. No. 61-3] at 5 ¶ 14.

[.text-justify]
LBRY's co-founders largely self-funded their initial development efforts, but they did raise “a small amount of funds from a number of angel investors.” [underline]#See# Def.'s Mem., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791680[Doc. No. 61-1] at 5. In September 2016, the company also obtained $500,000 in debt financing through Pillar VC, a venture capital firm. [underline]#See# Kauffman Decl., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Doc. No. 61-3] at 9 ¶ 29. Since then, LBRY has largely relied on sales and transfers of LBC to fund its operations. [underline]#See# 9/28/2016 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791450[Doc. No. 57-8]. 

[.text-justify]
To date, the company has spent approximately half of its pre-mined LBC through various transactions. [underline]#See# Kauffman Decl., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Doc. No. 61-3] at 4 ¶ 14. LBRY assigned 2 million of its pre-mined LBC to Pillar to extend the company's debt financing. [underline]#See# Token Issuance Agreement, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792185[Doc. No. 64-30].

*III&#46; [underline]#ANALYSIS#*

[text-justify] 
To establish a prima facie violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act, the SEC must prove that LBRY offered or sold securities in interstate commerce without filing a registration statement. [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iedab2640c58d11ecbf45df569f0c2bfa/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_8173_939++[SEC v.

Kahlon, 873 F.3d 500, 504 (5th Cir. 2017)]. LBRY does not challenge the SEC's contention that it offered and sold LBC in interstate commerce without registering its offerings with the SEC. Nor does it argue that its past offerings fall within an exemption to the registration requirement. Thus, the only issues impeding a finding that LBRY violated Section 5 are LBRY's claim that it did not offer LBC as a security and its argument that it was not given fair notice that it needed to register its offerings. I address each issue in turn. 

A&#46; Did LBRY Offer LBC as a Security?

[.text-justify]
When Congress adopted the Securities Act, “it enacted a definition of ‘security’ sufficiently broad to encompass virtually any instrument that might be sold as an investment.” link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I5dff0cc59c9011d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_780_60++[Reves v.

The First Circuit has broken the Howey test into three parts: “(1) the investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with an expectation of profits to be derived solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.” link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I13202b1079bf11d9ac1ffa9f33b6c3b0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_48++[SG Ltd., 265 F.3d at 46]. Here, only the third component of the Howey test is in dispute. Thus, the issue to be decided is whether the economic realities surrounding LBRY's offerings of LBC led investors to have “a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.” [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iab8f1e949bf011d991d0cc6b54f12d4d/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_780_852++[Forman, 421 U.S. at 852]. I analyze the evidence that bears on this issue by first examining LBRY's representations to prospective purchasers and the company's business model. I then turn to LBRY's argument that it has not offered LBC as a security because some purchasers acquired LBC for use on the LBRY Network.

1&#46; LBRY's Representations to Potential Purchasers 

[.text-justify]
The SEC identifies multiple statements by LBRY that it claims led potential investors to reasonably expect that LBC would grow in value as the company continued to oversee the development of the LBRY Network. LBRY minimizes the significance of these statements, and points to its many disclaimers that it did not intend for LBC to be purchased as an investment, but the SEC is correct. LBRY has - at key moments and despite its protestations - been acutely aware of LBC's potential value as an investment. And it made sure potential investors were too. 
[.text-justify]
When LBRY launched the LBRY Network in June 2016, LBC's market capitalization was a healthy $140 million. [underline]#See# 7/15/2016 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[Doc. No. 57-11]. This, despite the Network's relative infancy and limited usability. By the following month, LBC's market capitalization had ballooned to $1.2 billion. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[Id.] In response, LBRY issued a blog post reflecting on LBC's skyrocketing value. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] 
[.text-justify]
LBRY captioned the post: “1.2B Market Cap and We Don't Care.” Id. It began by touting the rapid growth in LBC's value, but frankly acknowledged that it could not say whether the current valuation was justified. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] At that point, only three videos were available on the blockchain, each produced by LBRY itself. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] And LBRY's staff were hard at work “frantically debugging” and developing its product. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] What LBRY did claim to know though was “that the long-term value proposition of LBRY is tremendous, but also dependent on our team staying focused on the task at hand: building this thing.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] It then closed the post by announcing a policy of neutrality with respect to LBC's price but plainly stating that “[o]ver the long-term, the interests of LBRY and the holders of [LBC] are aligned.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] 
[.text-justify]
In August 2016, the COO of LBRY, Josh Finer, emailed a potential investor explaining that the company was “currently negotiating private placements of LBC with several [other] investors” and asked the recipient to write him back “if there is interest” so the two could “chat.” [underline]#See# COO Email, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[Doc. No. 59-7]. The thrust of the email (subject line: “LBRY Credits Now Trading – LBC”) is clear. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[id.] After briefly noting that the platform was up and running, the COO explained how LBC are being traded on “major crypto exchanges” and that trading volume is moving at a healthy clip. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[id.] The “opportunity is obvious,” wrote the COO, “buy a bunch of credits, put them away safely, and hope that in 1-3 years we've appreciated even 10% of how much Bitcoin has in the past few years.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[id.] He wraps up by pitching LBRY's commitment to building its Network: “[i]f our product has the utility we plan, the credits should appreciate accordingly.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[id.] 
[.text-justify]
By November 2016, LBC's price was down, and some LBC investors were getting jittery. Jeremy Kauffman, LBRY's CEO, published a blog post titled “Acryptypical: The CEO of LBRY on the price of LBC,” outlining his view of LBRY's condition and providing “a canonical answer to questions about the price of LBC.” [underline]#See# 11/15/2016 Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[Doc. No. 57-21]. LBC's price was low, he contended, because of simple economics: the supply of LBC entering circulation through mining was outpacing the demand for new tokens. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] And demand was low because, at that point, “there [was] no reason to buy” LBC. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] When LBRY launched, Kauffman explained, it was “the barest, minimum proof-of-concept [application] possible.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] 
[.text-justify]
Although it had only been a few months since the launch, LBRY still stressed its long-term goal of “buil[ding] a product that is compelling enough to change people's habits,” replacing “YouTube” and “Amazon.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] And while investors were unlikely to make a “quick buck,” Kauffman encouraged them to “hold onto [their LBC] (or spend it to buy some of [LBRY's] great content . . . .).” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] LBRY's message was clear: We are a work in progress. LBC reflects that. Bear with us.  
[.text-justify]
In another communication, this time on Reddit, a user who was “trying to do ++[their]++ research before putting in ++[their]++ money” asked some general questions about how LBRY would manage its holdings of LBC. [underline]#See# Reddit Thread, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791462[Doc. No. 57-20]. In response, LBRY's Community Manager explained that the only way LBC will be “worth something in the future is if LBRY delivers on their promises to create a revolutionary way to share and monetize content.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791462[id.] The thread also includes another Redditor advising the community manager on what information “would help people with their investment decisions.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791462[id.] 

[.text-justify] 
Another relevant representation came in an interview with Mike Vine, LBRY's “Technology Evangelist”. [underline]#See# Vine Interview, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791461[Doc. No. 57-19]. Vine explained how the future “value of LBRY credits” would depend on “the success of our media marketplace.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791461[id.] When the interviewer asked how LBRY would keep “stolen[,] . . . unsavory, or downright illegal” content from the protocol, Vine's response betrayed LBRY's powerbroking role within its ecosystem by explaining that LBRY might be able to use its “position as the ‘market maker’ of [LBC] to basically make it more expensive for people to abuse the network.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791461[id.]  
[.text-justify]
In January 2018, Kauffman wrote further on the benefits of blockchain technology in another essay entitled “Blockchain is Love, Blockchain is Life.” 
[underline]#See# 1/10/2018 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[Doc. No. 57-16]. There, he wrote about what he called the “incentive problem[]” in developing open-source alternatives to existing technologies that are controlled by private companies. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[id.] One solution to this problem, as Kauffman saw it, was to be found in blockchain technology, which allowed for blockchain tokens to be used to realign incentives. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[id.] Because a blockchain token “has value in proportion to the usage and success of the network,” developers are incentivized to work to develop and promote new uses for blockchain. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[Id.] As Kauffman put it: 
[.text-justify]
[.quoteblock]#`_"It means that the people who discover and utilize a new protocol or network when it's just getting off the ground can reap substantial value by being there first. This solves the incentive problems around being a first-mover and softens the pain of using a service that probably won't be as feature-rich or slick as established competitors' options. It provides a source of funding for the development of the protocol. The creators can use the token to pay for the salaries and equipment required to get it started."_`#

link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[Id.] 

[.text-justify]
And in yet another post, this time in October 2020, LBRY provided another positive update. [underline]#See# 10/14/2020 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[Doc. No. 57-24]. It explained that it still saw itself as meeting the consumer “demand for a userowned and controlled alternative to YouTube and big tech.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[id.] Indeed, its work creating a “compelling token economy centered around digital content exchange” was still “imminently achievable” with just “some tweaks.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[id.] LBRY also touted the enormous potential it saw in continuing to develop its application on its blockchain. Other blockchain companies, the post asserted, are forced to rely on “some third-party” to “magicly [sic] build a world-class application” on their blockchains. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[id.] Not LBRY. And since “[a]pplications used by billions of people can be worth trillions of dollars,” LBRY was uniquely poised to “deliver that value” by “own[ing] the whole stack.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[id.]  
[.text-justify]
These statements are representative of LBRY's overall messaging about the growth potential for LBC, and thus the SEC is correct that potential investors would understand that LBRY was pitching a speculative value proposition for its digital token. LBRY's messaging amounts to precisely the “not-very-subtle form of economic inducement” the First Circuit identified in [underline]#SG# as evidencing [underline]#Howey's# “expectation of profits.” [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I13202b1079bf11d9ac1ffa9f33b6c3b0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_54++[SG Ltd., 265 F.3d at 54-55]. 
[.text-justify]
LBRY does not disavow its statements regarding LBC's value or price, but notes that the statements the SEC identifies constitute only 0.25% of “the total number of posts and messages the company has published since its inception.” [underline]#See# Def.'s Obj., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845[Doc. No. 74] at 5. But this statistic relies on a misleading denominator. Of course, like many other companies, LBRY regularly publishes statements on a range of topics, and could not argue that the 8,805 tweets it identified having posted, [underline]#see# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845[id.], all pertain in equal measure to its views of LBC's long-term value proposition. Since LBRY makes no effort to tally the number of comparable statements to those identified by the SEC, its argument lacks weight.  
[.text-justify]
LBRY also relies on the fact that it informed some potential purchasers of LBC that the company was not offering its token as an investment. But a disclaimer cannot undo the objective economic realities of a transaction. [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I4ba864e06e4411eaafc9a4147037e074/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_7903_365++[SEC v.

[.text-justify] 
2&#46; LBRY's Business Model 

[.text-justify]
As I just laid out, LBRY made no secret in its communications with potential investors that it expected LBC to grow in value through its managerial and entrepreneurial efforts. But even if it had never explicitly broadcast its views on the subject, any reasonable investor who was familiar with the company's business model would have understood the connection. 
[.text-justify]
From its inception, LBRY's profitability turned on its ability to grow the value of LBC by increasing usage of the LBRY Network. As Kauffman explained in an October 2016 informal business plan, LBC was the means by which LBRY and other early adopters would be able to profit as use of the network increased. [underline]#See# LBRY Plan, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030[Doc. No. 62-2] at 9. This was because “[e]ach percentage of [LBC] can be thought of as having a value proportional to the sum of all information transacted through the network.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030[Id.] In other words, as demand for information stored on the blockchain increased, so too would LBC's value. Accordingly, Kauffman reasoned, “[g]iven this situation, the most reasonable path to profit is to reserve a portion of the cryptocurrency.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030[Id.] Later in the same plan, he discussed the company's liquidation value by stating “[s]ince LBRY's most significant asset will be its credits, it could simply liquify these credits at a return of 10-10,000x on any investment.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030[Id.] at 10. 
[.text-justify]
Similarly, in a post on its website titled “Answers to Big Questions From our Reddit AMA,” LBRY responded to the question “How does the company behind LBRY make money?” by stating:  
[.text-justify]
[.quoteblock]#`_"The LBRY protocol has a built-in digital currency that allows it to function, called LBRY Credits. These Credits are very similar to bitcoins. Having a built-in digital currency creates an opportunity for a new kind of business that has never existed: the protocol first enterprise . . . LBRY Inc. has reserved 10% of all LBRY Credits to fund continued development and provide profit for the founders. Since Credits only gain value as the use of the protocol grows, the company has an incentive to continue developing this open-source project."_`# 

9/28/2016 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791450[Doc. No. 57-8]. +

[.text-justify]
The problem for LBRY is not just that a reasonable purchaser of LBC would understand that the tokens being offered represented investment opportunities - even if LBRY never said a word about it. It is that, by retaining hundreds of millions of LBC for itself, LBRY also signaled that it was motivated to work tirelessly to improve the value of its blockchain for itself and any LBC purchasers. This structure, which any reasonable purchaser would understand, would lead purchasers of LBC to expect that they too would profit from their holdings of LBC as a result of LBRY's assiduous efforts. 

[.text-justify]
Simply put, by intertwining LBRY's financial fate with the commercial success of LBC, LBRY made it obvious to its investors that it would work diligently to develop the Network so that LBC would increase in value. As LBRY said, “[o]ver the long-term, the interests of LBRY and the holders of Credits are aligned.” [underline]#See# 7/15/2016 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[Doc.

The SEC's burden is made all the easier by statements LBRY made about its managerial efforts, like how “the long-term value proposition of LBRY is . . . dependent on our team staying focused on the task at hand: building this thing.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] By its own account, LBRY expended significant managerial efforts to develop its Network and increase the value of LBC.

3&#46; Consumptive Uses for LBC 

[.text-justify]
LBRY's primary response to the SEC's claim starts with two generally uncontested facts: (1) LBC is a utility token designed for use on the LBRY Blockchain, and (2) some unknown number of purchasers of LBC acquired it at least in part with the intention of using it rather than holding it as an investment. Building from there, LBRY leaps to the conclusion that LBC cannot be a security even if LBRY offered it as an investment. LBRY is mistaken about both the facts and the law. 
[.text-justify]
Nothing in the case law suggests that a token with both consumptive and speculative uses cannot be sold as an investment contract. Despite LBRY's insistence to the contrary, I cannot reject the SEC's contention that LBRY offered LBC as a security simply because some LBC purchases were made with consumptive intent. Were it otherwise, the Securities Act would be unable to adapt to the “countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits” wherever a token held some consumptive utility. [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I22292b4f9bf011d993e6d35cc61aab4a/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_780_299++[Howey, 328 U.S.] at 299. 
Accordingly, statements from a subset of LBC holders that they purchased LBC for use on the LBRY Blockchain is of limited relevance in determining whether LBRY offered it as a security. [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I14265fa660e511deb08de1b7506ad85b/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_1021++[Warfield, 569 F.3d] at 1021 (“[W]hile the subjective intent of the purchasers may have some bearing on the issue of whether they entered into investment contracts, we must focus our inquiry on what the purchasers were offered or promised.”). 
[.text-justify]
In summary, what the evidence in the record discloses is that LBRY promoted LBC as an investment that would grow in value over time through the company's development of the LBRY Network. While some unknown number of purchasers may have acquired LBC in part for consumptive purposes, this does not change the fact that the objective economic realities of LBRY's offerings of LBC establish that it was offering it as a security. 
 
B&#46; Did LBRY Receive Fair Notice? 
[.text-justify]
LBRY argues that I should nonetheless deny the SEC's motion because it did not receive fair notice that its offerings were subject to the securities laws. In pressing this argument, LBRY has abandoned any broad claim that it lacked fair notice of the way in which the [underline]#Howey# test applies to digital tokens in general. Def.'s Obj., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845[Doc. No. 74] at 24. Instead, it complains that it lacked fair notice because, until the SEC brought this action, “the Commission historically and consistently focused its guidance, as well as its enforcement efforts, exclusively on the issuance of digital assets in the context of an [Initial Coin Offering] ICO.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845[Id.] 
[.text-justify]
The principal problem with LBRY's fair notice argument is that it offers nothing more to support its position than its bald claim that this is the first case in which the SEC has attempted to enforce the registration requirement against an issuer of digital tokens that did not conduct an ICO.
[.text-justify]
LBRY does not point to any specific statement by the SEC suggesting that companies need only comply with the registration requirement if they conduct an ICO. Nor does LBRY offer any persuasive reading of [underline]#Howey# that would cause a reasonable issuer to conclude that only ICOs are subject to the registration requirement. The test outlined in [underline]#Howey# is necessarily a fact specific one, in which no single fact will likely be dispositive. While participation in an ICO may be relevant to the analysis, it will not determine the outcome in a case like this, where the undisputed evidence leaves no doubt that LBRY offered and sold LBC as a security.  
[.text-justify]
LBRY relies on the Second Circuit's decision in [underline]#Upton v. SEC# for the proposition that the SEC may not impose a sanction for violating the securities laws “pursuant to a substantial change in its enforcement policy that was not reasonably communicated to the public.” [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_98++[75 F.3d 92, 98 (2nd Cir. 1996)]. But, as the SEC notes, the facts of [underline]#Upton# bear no resemblance to the present case. [underline]#Upton# involved an attempt by the SEC to sanction the CFO of a brokerage firm for violating an SEC rule that established a formula for setting the amount of money that the brokerage was required to maintain in a customer reserve account. link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_93++[Id.] at 93. Although it was undisputed that the brokerage had at all times complied with the “literal terms” of the rule, an administrative law judge relied on a novel interpretation of the rule by the SEC to conclude that the CFO could be sanctioned. link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_94++[Id.] at 94-96. Because the SEC did not give public notice of its new interpretation until after the brokerage had ended its offensive practice, the Second Circuit vacated the sanction imposed by the Commission. link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_94++[Id.] at 98. 
[.text-justify]
The present case is obviously quite different from the problem the court confronted in [underline]#Upton#. The SEC has not based its enforcement action here on a novel interpretation of a rule that by its terms does not expressly prohibit the relevant conduct. Instead, the SEC has based its claim on a straightforward application of a venerable Supreme Court precedent that has been applied by hundreds of federal courts across the country over more than 70 years. While this may be the first time it has been used against an issuer of digital tokens that did not conduct an ICO, LBRY is in no position to claim that it did not receive fair notice that its conduct was unlawful. 

[.text-center]
*IV&#46; [underline]#CONCLUSION#*

[.text-justify]
As I have explained, the only issues raised by the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment are whether LBRY offered LBC as a security and whether LBRY received fair notice that it needed to register its offerings. Because no reasonable trier of fact could reject the SEC's contention that LBRY offered LBC as a security, and LBRY does not have a triable defense that it lacked fair notice, the SEC is entitled to judgment. The SEC's Motion for Summary Judgment (link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791412[Doc. No. 55]) is granted, and LBRY's Motion for Summary Judgment (link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791679[Doc. No. 61]) is denied.

==== Discussion Questions ====

. In LBRY, some of the token purchases were made with consumptive intent and some token purchases were made with investment intent, does the proportion of the purchases for investment vs. consumption matter for the Howey test?  
. Would it make a difference for the Howey test if there were other organizations beyond LBRY promoting the LBC token?  
. Could LBRY have applied Bill Hinman's reasoning to argue that even though LBC was originally a security, it was no longer a security by the time of the SEC action, similar to Ethereum?

ANALISA TORRES, District Judge:

[.text-justify]
Plaintiff, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), brings this action against Defendants Ripple Labs, Inc. (“Ripple”) and two of its senior leaders, Bradley Garlinghouse and Christian A. Larsen, alleging that Defendants engaged in the unlawful offer and sale of securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and (c). Am. Compl. ¶¶ 9, 430–35, ECF No. 46. The SEC also alleges that Garlinghouse and Larsen aided and abetted Ripple’s Section 5 violations. _Id._ ¶¶ 9, 436–40.
[.text-justify]
Before the Court are the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment. ECF Nos. 824, 836; _see also_ ECF Nos. 621, 625, 639, 642.  For the reasons stated below, the SEC’s motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, and Defendants’ motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.

[.text-center]
*BACKGROUND*

&#8195;I&#46;&#8195; [underline]#Factual Background#

&#8195;&#8195;A&#46; Development of the XRP Ledger and the Founding of Ripple

[.text-justify]
In 2011 and early 2012, Arthur Britto, Jed McCaleb, and David Schwartz developed the source code for a cryptographically secured ledger, or a “blockchain,” which is now known as the XRP Ledger. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 11, ECF No. 842; _see also_ ECF No. 668. They aimed to create a faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient alternative to the bitcoin blockchain, the first blockchain ledger which was introduced in 2009. _Id._ ¶¶ 4, 12. When the XRP Ledger launched in 2012, its source code generated a fixed supply of 100 billion XRP. _Id._ ¶¶ 17–18. XRP is the native digital token of the XRP Ledger, and the XRP Ledger requires XRP to operate. _Id._ ¶¶ 13–14. Each unit of XRP is divisible into one million “drops,” and each unit or drop of XRP is fungible with any other unit or drop. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 17–18, ECF No. 835; _see also_ ECF No. 663.

[.text-justify]
In 2012, Britto, Defendant Larsen, and McCaleb founded Ripple. _Id._ ¶ 41; SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 32. Larsen became Ripple’s CEO, a position he held until December 2016. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 41. Of the 100 billion XRP generated by the XRP Ledger’s code, the three founders retained 20 billion for themselves (including 9 billion for Larsen) and provided 80 billion XRP to Ripple. _Id._ ¶ 15; SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 21. The founders did not sell any XRP before the launch of the XRP Ledger, and Ripple never owned the 20 billion XRP retained by the three founders. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 20, 22.

[.text-justify]
Since its founding, Ripple’s mission has been to realize an “Internet of Value” by using technology to facilitate the transfer of value across the internet. _Id._ ¶ 35. Specifically, Ripple “seeks to modernize international payments by developing a global payments network for international currency transfers.” _Id._ For instance, Ripple developed a software product called RippleNet, which allows customers to clear and settle cross-border financial transactions on mutually agreed upon terms. _Id._ ¶ 41. One feature of RippleNet is known as “on demand liquidity” (“ODL”). _Id._ ¶ 45. ODL facilitates cross-border transactions by allowing customers to exchange fiat currency (for example, U.S. dollars) for XRP and then the XRP for another fiat currency (for example, Mexican pesos). _Id._ ¶ 46; Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 740.

[.text-justify]
Like ODL, some, but not all, of Ripple’s products and services rely on the XRP Ledger and XRP. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 44. The XRP Ledger is based on open-source software; anyone can use the ledger, submit transactions, host a node to contribute to the validation of transactions, propose changes to the source code, or develop applications that run on the ledger. _Id._ ¶¶ 52, 54. Other developers have built software products that use the XRP Ledger, such as payment-processing applications. _Id._ ¶ 59. Ripple has also funded companies as part of its “Xpring” initiative to incentivize the development of other use “cases” on the XRP Ledger. _Id._ ¶¶ 58–59.

&#8195;&#8195;B&#46; Defendants’ Sales and Distributions of XRP

[.text-justify]
At all times before the end of 2020, Ripple owned between 50 and 80 billion XRP. _See_ Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 15, 35; _see also id._ ¶ 256. Although the parties dispute the specific dollar amounts and details, they agree that from 2013 through the end of 2020, Ripple engaged in various sales and distributions of XRP. _See id._ ¶¶ 647, 716; _see generally_ SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 92–123.

[.text-justify]
First, Ripple, through wholly owned subsidiaries, sold XRP directly to certain counterparties (primarily institutional buyers, hedge funds, and ODL customers) pursuant to written contracts (the “Institutional Sales”). SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 105; Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 5–6, 619–20, 716. The SEC alleges that Ripple sold approximately $728.9 million of XRP in these Institutional Sales. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 716.

[.text-justify]
Second, Ripple sold XRP on digital asset exchanges “programmatically,” or through the use of trading algorithms (the “Programmatic Sales”). SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 95; Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 647. Ripple’s XRP sales on these digital asset exchanges were blind bid/ask transactions: Ripple did not know who was buying the XRP, and the purchasers did not know who was selling it. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 96; Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 652–54. The SEC alleges that Ripple sold approximately $757.6 million of XRP in Programmatic Sales. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 647. Ripple used the proceeds from the Institutional and Programmatic Sales to fund its operations. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 156–70.

[.text-justify]
Ripple also distributed XRP as a form of payment for services (“Other Distributions”). Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 827–30. For instance, Ripple distributed XRP to its employees as a form of employee compensation. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 110; Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 217–18. Ripple also distributed XRP in conjunction with its Xpring initiative to fund third parties that would develop new applications for XRP and the XRP Ledger. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 831–32. In sum, the SEC alleges that Ripple recognized revenue of $609 million from its distributions of XRP to
individuals and entities in exchange for services. _Id._ ¶¶ 829–30. 

[.text-justify]
In addition to Ripple’s sales and distributions, Larsen and Garlinghouse offered and sold XRP in their individual capacities. After stepping down as CEO of Ripple in December 2016, Larsen became the Executive Chairman of Ripple’s Board of Directors, a position he currently holds. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 128–29. From at least 2013 through 2020, Larsen sold XRP on digital asset exchanges programmatically and made at least $450 million from his sales. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 868.

[.text-justify]
Garlinghouse was hired as Ripple’s COO in April 2015. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 140. After Larsen stepped down as CEO, Garlinghouse became CEO effective January 1, 2017, a position he currently holds. _Id._ ¶ 143. From April 2017 through 2020, Garlinghouse sold XRP on digital asset exchanges, id. ¶¶ 303, 310; the SEC alleges that Garlinghouse sold approximately $150 million in XRP during this period, Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 870. Garlinghouse has also received XRP as part of his overall compensation from Ripple. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 145. Defendants did not file a registration statement as to any offers or sales of XRP. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 928. Ripple did not publicly file any financial statements or other periodic reports, nor did it make any EDGAR filings with the SEC for Ripple or XRP, such as a Form 10-Q, Form 10-K, or Form 8-K relating to XRP. _Id._ ¶¶ 930–32.

&#8195;&#8195;C&#46; Defendants’ XRP Marketing Campaign

[.text-justify]
The SEC alleges that “in 2013 Defendants began extensive, years-long marketing efforts representing they would search for purported ‘use’ and ‘value’ for XRP—and casting XRP as an opportunity to invest in those efforts.” SEC Opp. at 4, ECF No. 841. The SEC points to a wide range of statements, including informational brochures, internal talking points, public blog posts, statements on social media, videos, interviews with various Ripple employees, and more. Defendants dispute the SEC’s factual narrative and argue that the SEC “cherry-picks excerpts from documents with many authors and from public statements of many speakers, made at many points across an eight-year period of time to many audiences.” Defs. Opp. at 10, ECF No. 828.

[.text-justify]
Since at least 2013, Ripple has prepared and distributed documents that describe the company’s operations, the XRP trading market, and the XRP Ledger. For example, in 2013 and 2014, Ripple created three brochures: a “Ripple for Gateways” brochure, a “Ripple Primer,” and a “Deep Dive for Finance Professionals.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 59–60, 171. These documents were distributed publicly to prospective and existing XRP investors and outline, among other things, the relationship between XRP and Ripple’s business model. _Id._ Ripple circulated versions of the “Gateways” brochure to more than one hundred third parties, id. ¶ 172; the “Primer” had “widespread distribution,” id. ¶ 178; and the “Deep Dive” was posted on Ripple’s website and sent to over one hundred people, id. ¶¶ 185–86. Later, starting at the end of 2016, Ripple began to publish on its website quarterly “XRP Market Reports,” which were intended to provide “clarity and visibility” about Ripple’s market activities. _Id._ ¶¶ 500–01.

[.text-justify]
Ripple and its senior leaders used a variety of social media platforms—including Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and XRP Chat, an online forum described as “The Largest XRP Crypto Community Forum”—to communicate about XRP and Ripple. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 77, 192; _see, e.g., id._ ¶¶ 391–96, 401–08, 425, 437–40. Ripple officials also spoke in interviews about the company and its relationship to XRP. For instance, Larsen gave interviews in which he discussed XRP, e.g., id. ¶¶ 371, 377, and Garlinghouse was interviewed by media outlets such as the Financial Times, Bloomberg, and CNBC, spoke with organizations like the Economic Club of New York, and participated at conferences such as DC Fintech, in which he described Ripple’s operations and the XRP market, _e.g., id._ ¶¶ 252, 263, 269, 387, 444, 446. 

&#8195;&#8195;D&#46; Defendants’ Receipt of Legal Advice About XRP Offers and Sales

[.text-justify]
In February 2012, before the XRP Ledger was publicly launched, Ripple’s founders, including Larsen, received from the Perkins Coie LLP law firm a memorandum, which sought to “review the proposed product and business structure, analyze the legal risks associated with [Ripple], and recommend steps to mitigate these risks.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 986; _see_ ECF No. 846-29 at 4. The memorandum analyzes, among other things, the legal risks associated with selling XRP. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 986. Specifically, it states that “[i]f sold to [i]nvestors, [XRP tokens] are likely to be securities,” and “[t]o the extent that [the founders’] issuance of [XRP] does not involve an investment of money, there is a low risk that [XRP] will be considered an investment contract.” _Id._ ¶¶ 986, 989; _see_ ECF No. 846-29 at 5, 12.

[.text-justify]
In October 2012, Ripple, Larsen, and others received another memorandum from Perkins Coie which sought to “review the proposed features of the Ripple [n]etwork and [XRP] and to provide recommendations for mitigating relevant legal risks.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 987; _see_ ECF No. 846-30 at 3. That memorandum states that “[a]lthough we believe that a compelling argument can be made that [XRP tokens] do not constitute ‘securities’ under federal securities laws, given the lack of applicable case law, we believe that there is some risk, albeit small, that the [SEC] disagrees with our analysis.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 993; _see_ ECF No. 846-30 at 6. The memorandum further states that, “[t]he more that [the founders and Ripple] promote [XRP] as an investment opportunity, the more likely it is that the SEC will take action and argue that [XRP tokens] are ‘investment contracts.’” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 993; _see_ ECF No. 846-30 at 6.

[.text-justify]
Larsen reviewed both the February and the October 2012 memoranda and discussed them with Perkins Coie attorneys. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 998. Both memoranda analyze XRP under the Supreme Court’s holding in _SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.,_ 328 U.S. 293 (1946), which outlines the standard for an investment contract. _Id._ ¶ 988.


&#8195;II&#46;&#8195; Procedural Background

[.text-justify]
On December 22, 2020, the SEC commenced this action. ECF No. 1. An amended complaint was filed on February 18, 2021. Am. Compl. Fact discovery closed on August 31, 2021, _see_ ECF No. 313, and expert discovery concluded on February 28, 2022, _see_ ECF No. 411. On March 11, 2022, the Court denied the SEC’s motion to strike Ripple’s affirmative defense that it “lacked . . . ‘notice that its conduct was in violation of law, in contravention of Ripple’s due process rights,’” ECF No. 128. ECF No. 440. That same day, the Court also denied Garlinghouse’s and Larsen’s separate motions to dismiss, ECF Nos. 105, 110. MTD Order, ECF No. 441. On March 6, 2023, the Court granted in part and denied in part the parties’ motions to preclude expert testimony. ECF No. 814.
 
[.text-justify]
Before the Court are the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment filed on September 13, 2022. ECF Nos. 621, 625; _see also_ ECF Nos. 639, 642, 824, 836. The Court has also reviewed amicus briefs from Accredify, Inc. d/b/a/ InvestReady, ECF No. 698; the Blockchain Association, ECF No. 706; the Chamber of Digital Commerce, ECF No. 649; Coinbase, Inc., ECF No. 705; Cryptillian Payment Systems, LLC, ECF No. 716; the Crypto Council for Innovation, ECF No. 711; I-Remit, Inc., ECF No. 660; the New Sports Economy Institute, ECF No. 717; Paradigm Operations LP, ECF No. 707; Phillip Goldstein and the Investor Choice Advocates Network, ECF No. 683; Reaper Financial, LLC, ECF No. 710; SpendTheBits, Inc., ECF No. 684; TapJets, Inc., ECF No. 661; Valhil Capital, LLC, ECF No. 722; Veri DAO, LLC, ECF No. 709; and XRP holders Jordan Deaton, James LaMonte, Mya LaMonte, Tyler LaMonte, Mitchell McKenna, and Kristiana Warner, ECF No. 708.

*DISCUSSION*

&#8195;I&#46;&#8195; [underline]#Legal Standard#

&#8195;&#8195;A&#46; Summary Judgment

[.text-justify]
Summary judgment is appropriate where the record shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); _see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,_ 477 U.S. 242, 247–48 (1986); _Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,_ 477 U.S. 317, 322–26 (1986). A genuine dispute exists “if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” _Anderson,_ 477 U.S. at 248.

[.text-justify]
The moving party initially bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact by citing evidence in the record. _See_ Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323–24; Koch v. Town of Brattleboro, Vt., 287 F.3d 162, 165 (2d Cir. 2002). If the moving party meets its initial burden, the burden then shifts to the opposing party to establish a genuine dispute of material fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1); Beard v. Banks, 548 U.S. 521, 529 (2006); PepsiCo, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., 315 F.3d 101, 105 (2d Cir. 2002) (per curiam). In doing so, the nonmoving party “may not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation,” Scotto v. Almenas, 143 F.3d 105, 114 (2d Cir. 1998), as “unsupported allegations do not create a material issue of fact,” Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., 224 F.3d 33, 41 (2d Cir. 2000).

&#8195;&#8195;B&#46; Section 5 Liability and the _Howey_ Test

[.text-justify]
Under Section 5 of the Securities Act, it is “unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, . . . to offer to sell, offer to buy or purchase[,] or sell” a “security” unless a registration statement is in effect or has been filed with the SEC as to the offer and sale of such security to the public. 15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), (c), (e). To prove a violation of Section 5, the SEC must show: (1) that no registration statement was filed or in effect as to the transaction, and (2) that the defendant directly or indirectly offered to sell or sold the securities (3) through interstate commerce. _See SEC v. Cavanagh,_ 445 F.3d 105, 111 n.13 (2d Cir. 2006).

[.text-justify]
Defendants do not dispute that they offered to sell and sold XRP through interstate commerce. _See, e.g.,_ Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 647, 716, 868, 870. They also do not dispute that they did not file a registration statement with the SEC for any offer or sale of XRP. _Id._ ¶ 928. The question before the Court is whether Defendants offered to sell or sold XRP as a security. Specifically, the SEC alleges that Defendants sold XRP as an “investment contract,” which is a type of security as defined by the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(1). _See, e.g.,_ SEC Mem. at 2, 5, 49, ECF No. 837; Am. Compl. ¶¶ 3, 9, 60. Defendants argue that they did not sell XRP as an investment contract, and, therefore, no registration statement was required. _See, e.g.,_ Defs. Mem. at 3, 36, ECF No. 825; Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 928.

[.text-justify]
In _SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.,_ the Supreme Court held that under the Securities Act, an investment contract is “a contract, transaction[,] or scheme whereby a person [(1)] invests his money [(2)] in a common enterprise and [(3)] is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.” 328 U.S. at 298–99; _see also SEC v. Edwards,_ 540 U.S. 389, 393 (2004). In analyzing whether a contract, transaction, or scheme is an investment contract, “form should be disregarded for substance and the emphasis should be on economic reality” and the “totality of circumstances.” _Tcherepnin v. Knight,_ 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967); _Glen-Arden Commodities, Inc. v. Constantino,_ 493 F.2d 1027, 1034 (2d Cir. 1974).

&#8195;&#8195;C&#46; Defendants’ “Essential Ingredients” Test

[.text-justify]
In their summary judgment briefing, Defendants advance a novel “essential ingredients” test, arguing that, in addition to the _Howey_ test, all investment contracts must contain three “essential ingredients”: (1) “a contract between a promoter and an investor that establishe[s] the investor’s rights as to an investment,” which contract (2) “impose[s] post-sale obligations on the promoter to take specific actions for the investor’s benefit” and (3) “grant[s] the investor a right to share in profits from the promoter’s efforts to generate a return on the use of investor funds.” Defs. Mem. at 2; _see id._ at 13–28.

[.text-justify]
The Court declines to adopt Defendants’ “essential ingredients” test, which would call for the Court to read beyond the plain words of _Howey_ and impose additional requirements not mandated by the Supreme Court. The Court sees no reason to do so. Neither _Howey_, nor its progeny, hold that an investment contract requires the existence of Defendants’ “essential ingredients.” To the contrary, these cases make clear that the relevant test reflects a focus on an investor’s expectation of “profits . . . from the efforts of others,” rather than the formal imposition of post-sale obligations on the promoter or the grant to an investor of a right to share in profits. _Howey_, 328 U.S. at 301. The Supreme Court’s use of the word “profits” in _Howey_ was intended to refer to “income or return,” _Edwards,_ 540 U.S. at 394, and financial returns on investments are not equivalent to post-sale obligations or profit sharing. Thus, the Court is not persuaded that precedent supports the consideration of these “ingredients” in determining whether a contract, transaction, or scheme constitutes an investment contract under _Howey_.

[.text-justify]
Defendants do not cite a single case that has applied their test. _See generally_ Defs. Mem. at 13–28. Rather, Defendants contend that the Court should look to the pre-1933 state “blue sky” law cases on which the _Howey_ Court relied. _Id._ at 16–17. According to Defendants, every pre-1933 blue sky investment contract case involved a contract, post-sale obligations on the promoter, and the investor’s right to receive a profit. _Id._ at 18–21. That may be so, but the _Howey_ Court relied on the state courts’ definition of an investment contract as “a contract or scheme for the placing of capital or laying out of money in a way intended to secure income or profit from its employment” when fashioning the relevant test. 328 U.S. at 298 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Had the Supreme Court intended to incorporate these ingredients as essential requirements, it would have done so. In any event, even accepting Defendants’ survey and analysis of the caselaw as accurate, the fact that pre-1933 investment contract cases shared some common features does not convert those common features into requirements necessary for finding an investment contract under _Howey_. Rather, the Supreme Court was guided by the “fundamental purpose undergirding the Securities Acts,” in which Congress “painted with a broad brush” in recognition of the “virtually limitless scope of human ingenuity.” _Reves v. Ernst & Young,_ 494 U.S. 56, 60–61 (1990). So, too, must this Court be guided.

[.text-justify]
Indeed, in the more than seventy-five years of securities law jurisprudence after _Howey_, courts have found the existence of an investment contract even in the absence of Defendants’ “essential ingredients,” including in recent digital asset cases in this District. _See, e.g., SEC v. Kik Interactive Inc.,_ 492 F. Supp. 3d 169, 175–80 (S.D.N.Y. 2020); _Balestra v. ATBCOIN LLC,_ 380 F. Supp. 3d 340, 354 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (“ATB Coins did not entitle purchasers to a pro rata share of the profits derived from any ATB-managed transaction . . . . However, such a formalized profit-sharing mechanism is not required.”). And this makes sense, given that the _Howey_ test was intended to “embod[y] a flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.” 328 U.S. at 299. Put differently, the _Howey_ test was intended to effectuate “[t]he statutory policy of affording broad protection to investors,” protection that is “not to be thwarted by unrealistic and irrelevant formulae.” _Id._ at 301. Accordingly, the Court rejects Defendants’ argument that all investment contracts must include post-sale obligations on the promoter and grant the investor a right to share in profits from the promoter’s efforts.

[.text-justify]
The Court does not reach Defendants’ first “essential ingredient”: that a contract must exist for an investment contract to exist. As discussed in greater detail below, in each instance where Defendants offered or sold XRP as an investment contract, a contract existed.

&#8195;II&#46;&#8195; [underline]#Analysis#

&#8195;&#8195;A&#46; The XRP Token

[.text-justify]
The plain words of _Howey_ make clear that “an investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means _a contract, transaction[,] or scheme._” 328 U.S. at 298–99 (emphasis
added). But the subject of a contract, transaction, or scheme is not necessarily a security on its face. Under _Howey_, the Court analyzes the economic reality and totality of circumstances surrounding the offers and sales of the underlying asset. _See Tcherepnin,_ 389 U.S. at 336; _Glen-Arden,_ 493 F.2d at 1034.

[.text-justify]
_Howey_ and its progeny have held that a variety of tangible and intangible assets can serve as the subject of an investment contract. _See, e.g., Howey_, 328 U.S. 293 (orange groves); _Glen-Arden,_ 493 F.2d 1027 (whiskey casks); _Edwards,_ 540 U.S. 389 (payphones); _Hocking v. Dubois,_ 885 F.2d 1449 (9th Cir. 1989) (condominiums), _cert. denied_, 494 U.S. 1078 (1990); _Cont’l Mktg. Corp. v. SEC,_ 387 F.2d 466 (10th Cir. 1967) (beavers); _SEC v. Telegram Grp. Inc.,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d 352 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (digital tokens). In each of these cases, the subject of the investment contract was a standalone commodity, which was not itself inherently an investment contract. For instance, if the original citrus groves in _Howey_ were later resold, those resales may or may not constitute investment contracts, depending on the totality of circumstances surrounding the later transaction.

[.text-justify]
Here, Defendants argue that XRP does not have the “character in commerce” of a security and is akin to other “ordinary assets” like gold, silver, and sugar. _See_ Defs. Mem. at
3–4, 42–44 (citation omitted). This argument misses the point because ordinary assets—like gold, silver, and sugar—may be sold as investment contracts, depending on the circumstances of those sales. _See Glen-Arden,_ 493 F.2d at 1033, 1035; _Fedance v. Harris,_ 1 F.4th 1278, 1288–89 (11th Cir. 2021) (“Plenty of items that can be consumed or used . . . have been the subject of transactions determined to be securities because they had the attributes of an investment.” (citation omitted)). Even if XRP exhibits certain characteristics of a commodity or a currency, it may nonetheless be offered or sold as an investment contract. +
&nbsp; +
[.quoteblock .text-justify]#As another court in this District recently held: +
&nbsp; +
While helpful as a shorthand reference, the security in this case is not simply the [digital token, the] Gram, which is little more than alphanumeric cryptographic sequence . . . . This case presents a “scheme” to be evaluated under _Howey_ that consists of the full set of contracts, expectations, and understandings centered on the sales and distribution of the Gram. _Howey_ requires an examination of the entirety of the parties’ understandings and expectations.# +
_Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 379. XRP, as a digital token, is not in and of itself a “contract, transaction[,] or scheme” that embodies the _Howey_ requirements of an investment contract. Rather, the Court examines the totality of circumstances surrounding Defendants’ different transactions and schemes involving the sale and distribution of XRP. _See Marine Bank v. Weaver,_ 455 U.S. 551, 560 n.11 (1982) (“Each transaction must be analyzed and evaluated on the basis of the content of the instruments in question, the purposes intended to be served, and the factual setting as a whole.”).


&#8195;&#8195;B&#46; Defendants’ Offers and Sales of XRP

[.text-justify]
The parties cross-move for summary judgment on the SEC’s claim under Section 5 of the Securities Act. Whether Defendants offered or sold “investment contracts” is a legal question that the Court resolves based on the undisputed record. _See SEC v. Thompson,_ 732 F.3d 1151, 1160–61 (10th Cir. 2013) (collecting cases). The SEC alleges that Ripple engaged in three categories of unregistered XRP offers and sales: + 
[.quoteblock .text-justify]#&nbsp; +
(1) Institutional Sales under written contracts for which it received $728 million; +
(2) Programmatic Sales on digital asset exchanges for which it received $757 million; and +
(3) Other Distributions under written contracts for which it recorded $609 million
in “consideration other than cash.”# +
_See_ SEC Reply at 4–5, ECF No. 843. The SEC also alleges that Larsen and Garlinghouse engaged in unregistered individual XRP sales, from which they received at least $450 million and $150 million, respectively. _See id._ at 5. The Court shall separately analyze and evaluate each category of transaction. _See Marine Bank,_ 455 U.S. at 560 n.11.

&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;1&#46; Institutional Sales

[.text-justify]
The Court first addresses Ripple’s Institutional Sales of XRP to sophisticated individuals and entities (the “Institutional Buyers”) pursuant to written contracts. _See_ SEC Mem. at 28–31; Defs. Mem. at 11. The SEC alleges that these Institutional Sales were distributions of XRP into public markets through conduits, and that “some Institutional [Buyers] were buying XRP as brokers, while others simply resold it as part of their trading strategies.” SEC Mem. at 28–29.

[.text-justify]
The first prong of _Howey_ examines whether an “investment of money” was part of the relevant transaction. 328 U.S. at 301. Here, the Institutional Buyers invested money by providing fiat or other currency in exchange for XRP. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 607. Defendants do not dispute that Ripple received money for XRP through its Institutional Sales. _See_ Defs. Mem. at 11; Defs. Opp. at 17 n.7. However, Defendants argue that an “investment of money” is different from “merely payment of money”—that is, _Howey_ requires not just payment of money but an intent to invest that money. _See_ Defs. Opp. at 18–19.

[.text-justify]
Not so. Defendants’ purported distinction is not supported by caselaw. The proper inquiry is whether the Institutional Buyers “provide[d] the capital,” _Howey_, 328 U.S. at 300, “put up their money,” _Glen-Arden,_ 493 F.2d at 1034, or “provide[d]” cash, _Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 368–69. Defendants do not dispute that there was a payment of money; the Court finds, therefore, that this element has been established.

[.text-justify]
The second prong of _Howey_, the existence of a “common enterprise,” 328 U.S. at 301, may be demonstrated through a showing of “horizontal commonality,” _Revak v. SEC Realty Corp.,_ 18 F.3d 81, 87 (2d Cir. 1994). Horizontal commonality exists where the investors’ assets are pooled and the fortunes of each investor are tied to the fortunes of other investors, as well as to the success of the overall enterprise. _See id._ at 88; _see also SEC v. SG Ltd.,_ 265 F.3d 42, 49 (1st Cir. 2001) (“[H]orizontal commonality [is] a type of commonality that involves the pooling of assets from multiple investors so that all share in the profits and risks of the enterprise.”); _ATBCOIN LLC,_ 380 F. Supp. 3d at 353.

[.text-justify]
Here, the undisputed record shows the existence of horizontal commonality. Ripple pooled the proceeds of its Institutional Sales into a network of bank accounts under the names of its various subsidiaries. _See, e.g.,_ ECF No. 831-29 ¶¶ 3–4; Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 795–98; _see also id._ ¶ 1004. Although Ripple maintained separate bank accounts for each subsidiary, Ripple controlled all of the accounts and used the funds raised from the Institutional Sales to finance its operations. _See_ Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 255–56; SEC Reply at 8; _cf._ Defs. Opp. at 22–23; Defs. Reply at 19–20, ECF No. 832. Defendants do not dispute that Ripple did not “segregate[] and separately manage[]” investor funds or “allow[] for profits to remain independent.” _Kik_, 492 F. Supp. 3d at 179; _see_ SEC Reply at 8. And, Ripple’s accountants recorded all of its XRP-related proceeds together. _See_ Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 147–48. 

[.text-justify]
Further, each Institutional Buyer’s ability to profit was tied to Ripple’s fortunes and the fortunes of other Institutional Buyers because all Institutional Buyers received the same fungible XRP. _See id._ ¶¶ 206–07. Ripple used the funds it received from its Institutional Sales to promote and increase the value of XRP by developing uses for XRP and protecting the XRP trading market. _See id._ ¶¶ 156–57, 161–68, 255–56. When the value of XRP rose, all Institutional Buyers profited in proportion to their XRP holdings. _See Kik,_ 492 F. Supp. 3d at 178 (“The success of the ecosystem drove demand for [the digital token] Kin and thus dictated investors’ profits.”); _Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 369–70 (finding horizontal commonality where the digital token purchasers “possess an identical instrument, the value of which is entirely dependent on the success or failure of the TON Blockchain” and “[t]he investors’ fortunes are directly tied to the success of the TON Blockchain as a whole”). The Court finds the existence of a common enterprise because the record demonstrates that there was a pooling of assets and that the fortunes of the Institutional Buyers were tied to the success of the enterprise as well as to the success of other Institutional Buyers.

[.text-justify]
The third prong of _Howey_ examines whether the economic reality surrounding Ripple’s Institutional Sales led the Institutional Buyers to have “a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.” _See United Hous. Found., Inc. v. Forman,_ 421 U.S. 837, 852 (1975). In this context, profit means an “income or return, to include, for example, dividends, other periodic payments, or _the increased value of the investment._” _Edwards_, 540 U.S. at 394 (emphasis added). The reasonable expectation of profits from the efforts of others need not be the sole reason a purchaser buys an investment; an asset may be sold for both consumptive and speculative uses. _See SEC v. LBRY, Inc.,_ No. 21 Civ. 260, 2022 WL 16744741, at *7 (D.N.H. Nov. 7, 2022). Moreover, “[t]he inquiry is an objective one focusing on the promises and offers made to investors; it is not a search for the precise motivation of each individual participant.” _Telegram_, 448 F. Supp. 3d at 371 (citing _Warfield v. Alaniz,_ 569 F.3d 1015, 1021 (9th Cir. 2009)).

[.text-justify]
Based on the totality of circumstances, the Court finds that reasonable investors, situated in the position of the Institutional Buyers, would have purchased XRP with the expectation that they would derive profits from Ripple’s efforts. From Ripple’s communications, marketing campaign, and the nature of the Institutional Sales, reasonable investors would understand that Ripple would use the capital received from its Institutional Sales to improve the market for XRP and develop uses for the XRP Ledger, thereby increasing the value of XRP. _Cf. Kik,_ 492 F. Supp. 3d at 179–80; _Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 371–78.

[.text-justify]
Starting in 2013, Ripple marketed XRP to potential investors, including the Institutional Buyers, by distributing promotional brochures that touted XRP as an investment tied to the company’s success. For instance, in the “Deep Dive” brochure, which was circulated to prospective investors, Ripple explains that its “business model is predicated on a belief that demand for XRP will increase . . . if the Ripple protocol becomes widely adopted,” and “[i]f the Ripple protocol becomes the backbone of global value transfer, Ripple . . . expects the demand for XRP to be considerable.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 187; ECF No. 855-14 at 23, 29, 31. Similarly, the “Ripple Primer” states that Ripple “hopes to make money from XRP if the world finds the Ripple network useful.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 180; ECF No. 861-26 at 20. The “Gateways” brochure also explains that “Ripple’s business model is based on the success of [XRP,]” and includes a graphical representation of bitcoin’s price change below the text: “Can a virtual currency really create and hold value? _Bitcoin proves it can_.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 173, 175; ECF No. 861-25 at 21.

[.text-justify]
Later, through its XRP Market Reports, Ripple continued to connect XRP’s price and trading to its own efforts. Ripple’s Q1 2017 XRP Markets Report states that the company’s efforts—including its “vocal . . . commitment to XRP,” the announcement of a new business relationship, and “continu[ing] to sign up banks to commercially deploy its enterprise blockchain solution and join its global payments network”—may have had an impact on XRP’s price increase and “impressive” trading volume. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 421; ECF No. 839-4 at 9. The Q2 2017 XRP Markets Report highlights XRP’s “dramatic” and “stunning” price increase and notes that “[t]he market responded favorably to [Ripple’s] escrow and decentralization announcements.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 422; ECF No. 839-4 at 16. Similarly, Ripple’s Q1 2020 XRP Markets Report states that XRP’s liquidity was “bolstered through new use cases for XRP outside of cross-border payments.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 366; ECF No. 839-4 at 98.

[.text-justify]
During this time, Ripple’s senior leaders echoed similar statements on various public channels. In a February 2014 interview, Larsen said, “for Ripple . . . to do well, we have to do a very good job in protecting the value of XRP and the value of the network,” and asked potential investors to “[g]ive [Ripple] time” to “add[] the most value to the protocol.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 461. In July 2017, David Schwartz, who was then chief cryptographer at Ripple, _see id._ ¶ 40, wrote on Reddit that “Ripple’s interest[s] closely (but, yes, not perfectly) align with those of other XRP holders,” id. ¶ 462. In February 2018, Schwartz posted on Reddit that what “really set[s] XRP apart from any other digital asset” is the “amazing team of dedicated professionals that Ripple has managed to amass to develop an ecosystem around XRP.” _Id._ ¶¶ 345, 349, 360. In a December 2017 interview, Garlinghouse stated that XRP gave Ripple “a huge strategic asset to go invest in and accelerate the vision [it] see[s] for an internet of value.” _Id._ ¶ 468. And, in March 2018, Garlinghouse said at a press conference that “Ripple is very, very interested in the success and the health of the ecosystem and will continue to invest in the ecosystem.” _Id._ ¶ 469.

[.text-justify]
Ripple and its senior leaders publicly emphasized the complexity of creating an “internet of value” and the need for extensive capital to solve this “trillion dollar” problem. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 101. For instance, in October 2017, Garlinghouse declared in a YouTube video: “I have no qualms saying definitively if we continue to drive the success we’re driving, we’re going to drive a massive amount of demand for XRP because we’re solving a multitrillion dollar problem.” _Id._ ¶ 98; _see also id._ ¶¶ 99–101. In July 2017, Schwartz wrote on Reddit that, “Ripple can justify spending $100 million on a project if it could reasonably be expected to increase the price of XRP by one penny over the long term.” _Id._ ¶ 462. In November 2017, Schwartz posted on XRP Chat that Ripple would use its “war chest” to put upward pressure on XRP’s price. _Id._ ¶ 445.

[.text-justify]
These statements, and many more, are representative of Ripple’s overall messaging to the Institutional Buyers about the investment potential of XRP and its relationship to Defendants’ efforts. Clearly, the Institutional Buyers would have understood that Ripple was pitching a speculative value proposition for XRP with potential profits to be derived from Ripple’s entrepreneurial and managerial efforts. _See LBRY,_ 2022 WL 16744741, at *5–6.

[.text-justify]
Further, the nature of the Institutional Sales also supports the conclusion that Ripple sold XRP as an investment rather than for consumptive use. In their sales contracts, some Institutional Buyers agreed to lockup provisions or resale restrictions based on XRP’s trading volume. _See, e.g.,_ Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 575, 800–01. These restrictions are inconsistent with the notion that XRP was used as a currency or for some other consumptive use. “Simply put, a rational economic actor would not agree to freeze millions of dollars . . . if the purchaser’s intent was to obtain a substitute for fiat currency.” _Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 373. Certain Institutional Sales contracts required the Institutional Buyer to indemnify Ripple for claims arising out of the sale or distribution of XRP, _see_ Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 792, and other contracts expressly stated that the Institutional Buyer was purchasing XRP “solely to resell or otherwise distribute . . . and not to use [XRP] as an [e]nd [u]ser or for any other purpose.” _Id._ ¶ 793. These various provisions in the Institutional Sales contracts support the conclusion that the parties did not view the XRP sale as a sale of a commodity or a currency—they understood the sale of XRP to be an investment in Ripple’s efforts.

[.text-justify]
Therefore, having considered the economic reality and totality of circumstances surrounding the Institutional Sales, the Court concludes that Ripple’s Institutional Sales of XRP constituted the unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act.

&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;2&#46; Programmatic Sales

[.text-justify]
The Court next addresses Ripple’s Programmatic Sales, which occurred under different circumstances from the Institutional Sales. _See_ SEC Mem. at 28; Defs. Mem. at 10–11. The SEC alleges that in the Programmatic Sales to public buyers (“Programmatic Buyers”) on digital asset exchanges, “Ripple understood that people were speculating on XRP as an investment,” “explicitly targeted speculators[,] and made increased speculative volume a ‘target goal.’” SEC Mem. at 28.

[.text-justify]
Having considered the economic reality of the Programmatic Sales, the Court concludes that the undisputed record does not establish the third _Howey_ prong. Whereas the Institutional Buyers reasonably expected that Ripple would use the capital it received from its sales to improve the XRP ecosystem and thereby increase the price of XRP, _see Kik,_ 492 F. Supp. 3d at 180; _cf. supra_ § II.B.1, Programmatic Buyers could not reasonably expect the same. Indeed, Ripple’s Programmatic Sales were blind bid/ask transactions, and Programmatic Buyers could not have known if their payments of money went to Ripple, or any other seller of XRP. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 96; Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 652–54. Since 2017, Ripple’s Programmatic Sales represented less than 1% of the global XRP trading volume. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 77, 82. Therefore, the vast majority of individuals who purchased XRP from digital asset exchanges did not invest their money in Ripple at all. An Institutional Buyer knowingly purchased XRP directly from Ripple pursuant to a contract, but the economic reality is that a Programmatic Buyer stood in the same shoes as a secondary market purchaser who did not know to whom or what it was paying its money.

[.text-justify]
Further, it is not enough for the SEC to argue that Ripple “explicitly targeted speculators” or that “Ripple understood that people were speculating on XRP as an investment,” SEC Mem. at 28, because a speculative motive “on the part of the purchaser or seller does not evidence the existence of an ‘investment contract’ within the meaning of the [Securities Act],” _Sinva, Inc. v. Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.,_ 253 F. Supp. 359, 367 (S.D.N.Y. 1966). “[A]nyone who buys or sells[, for example,] a horse or an automobile hopes to realize a profitable ‘investment.’ But the expected return is not contingent upon the continuing efforts of another.” _Id._ (citing _SEC v. C.M. Joiner Leasing Corp.,_ 320 U.S. 344, 348 (1943)). The relevant inquiry is whether this speculative motive “derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.” _Forman_, 421 U.S. at 852. It may certainly be the case that many Programmatic Buyers purchased XRP with an expectation of profit, but they did not derive that expectation from Ripple’s efforts (as opposed to other factors, such as general cryptocurrency market trends)—particularly because none of the Programmatic Buyers were aware that they were buying XRP from Ripple.

[.text-justify]
Of course, some Programmatic Buyers may have purchased XRP with the expectation of profits to be derived from Ripple’s efforts. However, “[t]he inquiry is an objective one focusing on the promises and offers made to investors; it is not a search for the precise motivation of each individual participant.” _Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 371 (citation omitted). Here, the record establishes that with respect to Programmatic Sales, Ripple did not make any promises or offers because Ripple did not know who was buying the XRP, and the purchasers did not know who was selling it. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 96; Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 652–54. In fact, many Programmatic Buyers were entirely unaware of Ripple’s existence. SEC Add. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 1606, ECF No. 844; ECF Nos. 831-1–831-26.

[.text-justify]
The Programmatic Sales also lacked other factors present in the economic reality of the Institutional Sales which cut in favor of finding “a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.” _Forman_, 421 U.S. at 852; _cf. supra_ § II.B.1. For instance, the Programmatic Sales were not made pursuant to contracts that contained lockup provisions, resale restrictions, indemnification clauses, or statements of purpose. _Cf. Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 373. Similarly, Ripple’s promotional materials, such as the “Ripple Primer” and the “Gateways” brochure, were widely circulated amongst potential investors like the Institutional Buyers. But, there is no evidence that these documents were distributed more broadly to the general public, such as XRP purchasers on digital asset exchanges. Nor is there evidence that Programmatic Buyers understood that statements made by Larsen, Schwartz, Garlinghouse, and others were representations of Ripple and its efforts.

[.text-justify]
Lastly, the Institutional Buyers were sophisticated entities, including institutional investors and hedge funds. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 105. An “examination of the entirety of the parties’ understandings and expectations,” including the “full set of contracts, expectations, and understandings centered on the sales and distribution of” XRP supports the conclusion that a reasonable investor, situated in the position of the Institutional Buyers, would have been aware of Ripple’s marketing campaign and public statements connecting XRP’s price to its own efforts. _Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 379. There is no evidence that a reasonable Programmatic Buyer, who was generally less sophisticated as an investor, shared similar “understandings and expectations” and could parse through the multiple documents and statements that the SEC highlights, which include statements (sometimes inconsistent) across many social media platforms and news sites from a variety of Ripple speakers (with different levels of authority) over an extended eight-year period.

[.text-justify]
Therefore, having considered the economic reality and totality of circumstances, the Court concludes that Ripple’s Programmatic Sales of XRP did not constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts.

&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;3&#46; Other Distributions

[.text-justify]
The SEC’s last category of XRP offers and sales are “Other Distributions under written  contracts for which [Ripple] recorded $609 million in ‘consideration other than cash’ in its audited financial statements.” SEC Reply at 5. These Other Distributions include distributions to employees as compensation and to third parties as part of Ripple’s Xpring initiative to develop new applications for XRP and the XRP Ledger. SEC Mem. at 31–32. The SEC alleges that “Ripple funded its projects by transferring XRP to third parties and then having them sell the XRP into public markets.” _Id._ at 31.

[.text-justify]
The Other Distributions do not satisfy _Howey’s_ first prong that there be an “investment of money” as part of the transaction or scheme. 328 U.S. at 301. _Howey_ requires a showing that the investors “provide[d] the capital,” id. at 300, “put up their money,” _Glen-Arden,_ 493 F.2d at 1034, or “provide[d]” cash, _Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 368–69. “In every case [finding an investment contract] the purchaser gave up some tangible and definable consideration in return for an interest that had substantially the characteristics of a security.” _Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v. Daniel,_ 439 U.S. 551, 560 (1979). Here, the record shows that recipients of the Other Distributions did not pay money or “some tangible and definable consideration” to Ripple. To the contrary, Ripple paid XRP to these employees and companies. And, as a factual matter, there is no evidence that “Ripple funded its projects by transferring XRP to third parties and then having them sell the XRP,” SEC Mem. at 31, because Ripple never received the payments from these XRP distributions.

[.text-justify]
In its opposition papers, the SEC pivots and argues instead that the Other Distributions were an indirect public offering because “the parties that received XRP from Ripple, such as an ‘[Xpring] recipient,’ could ‘transfer their XRP (in exchange for units of another currency, goods, or services) to another holder.’” SEC Opp. at 26 (citation omitted). But the SEC does not elsewhere allege that the recipients of these Other Distributions, like Ripple employees and Xpring third-party companies, were Ripple’s underwriters. In any event, the SEC does not develop the argument that these secondary market sales were offers or sales of investment contracts, particularly where the payment of money for these XRP sales never traced back to Ripple, and the Court cannot make such a finding. Therefore, having considered the economic reality and totality of circumstances, the Court concludes that Ripple’s Other Distributions did not constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts.

&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;4&#46; Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s Offers and Sales

[.text-justify]
Lastly, the Court addresses Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s offers and sales of XRP. Section 4(a)(1) of the Securities Act exempts “transactions by any person other than an issuer, underwriter, or dealer.” 15 U.S.C. § 77d(a)(1). The SEC argues that this exemption does not apply to Larsen and Garlinghouse because they are “affiliates” of Ripple and “an affiliate of the issuer—such as an officer, director, or controlling shareholder—ordinarily may not rely upon the Section 4(1) exemption.” _Cavanagh,_ 445 F.3d at 111.

[.text-justify]
The Court need not reach this issue. Like Ripple’s Programmatic Sales, Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s XRP sales were programmatic sales on various digital asset exchanges through blind bid/ask transactions. _See_ SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 280–84, 306–09. Larsen and Garlinghouse did not know to whom they sold XRP, and the buyers did not know the identity of the seller. Thus, as a matter of law, the record cannot establish the third _Howey_ prong as to these transactions. For substantially the same reasons discussed above, _supra_ § II.B.2, Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s offer and sale of XRP on digital asset exchanges did not amount to offers and sales of investment contracts.

&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;5&#46; Defendants’ Due Process Defenses

[.text-justify]
Defendants each assert a “fair notice” defense, claiming that the SEC violated their due process rights; Larsen and Garlinghouse also assert an as-applied vagueness defense based on the same due process principles. _See_ Defs. Opp. at 43 & n.28; _see also_ ECF No. 51 at 97–99; ECF No. 462 at 97–99; ECF No. 463 at 103–05.

[.text-justify]
“A fundamental principle in our legal system is that laws which regulate persons or entities must give fair notice of conduct that is forbidden or required.” _FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.,_ 567 U.S. 239, 253 (2012). This clarity requirement is “essential to the protections provided by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,” and “requires the invalidation of laws that are impermissibly vague.” _Id._ Laws fail to comport with due process when they (1) “fail[] to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited,” or (2) are so standardless that they authorize or encourage “seriously discriminatory enforcement.” _Id._ (citation omitted).

[.text-justify]
This “assessment cannot be conducted in the abstract; rather . . . the party claiming a lack of notice [must] show[] ‘that the statute in question provided insufficient notice that his or her behavior at issue was prohibited.’” ECF No. 440 at 8 (quoting _Copeland v. Vance,_ 893 F.3d 101, 110 (2d Cir. 2018)). “[T]he evaluation of any fair notice defense is objective—it does not require inquiry into ‘whether a particular [party] actually received a warning that alerted him or her to the danger of being held to account for the behavior in question.’” _Id._ at 10 n.5 (quoting _United States v. Smith,_ 985 F. Supp. 2d 547, 587 (S.D.N.Y. 2014), _aff’d sub nom. United States v. Halloran,_ 664 F. App’x 23 (2d Cir. 2016)).

[.text-justify]
The Court rejects Defendants’ fair notice and vagueness defenses as to the Institutional Sales. First, the caselaw that defines an investment contract provides a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it covers. _See Copeland,_ 893 F.3d at 114. _Howey_ sets forth a clear test for determining what constitutes an investment contract, and Howey’s progeny provides guidance on how to apply that test to a variety of factual scenarios. _See Smith,_ 985 F. Supp. 2d at 588 (“[I]t is not only the language of a statute that can provide the requisite fair notice; judicial decisions interpreting that statute can do so as well.”). That is constitutionally sufficient to satisfy due process. _See United States v. Zaslavskiy,_ No. 17 Cr. 647, 2018 WL 4346339, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 11, 2018) (“[T]he abundance of caselaw interpreting and applying _Howey_ at all levels of the judiciary, as well as related guidance issued by the SEC as to the scope of its regulatory authority and enforcement power, provide all the notice that is constitutionally required.”).

[.text-justify]
Second, the caselaw articulates sufficiently clear standards to eliminate the risk of arbitrary enforcement. _Howey_ is an objective test that provides the flexibility necessary for the assessment of a wide range of contracts, transactions, and schemes. Defendants focus on the SEC’s failure to issue guidance on digital assets and its inconsistent statements and approaches to regulating the sale of digital assets as investment contracts. _See_ Defs. Opp. at 45–52. But the SEC’s approach to enforcement, at least as to the Institutional Sales, is consistent with the enforcement actions that the agency has brought relating to the sale of other digital assets to buyers pursuant to written contracts and for the purpose of fundraising. _See, e.g., Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d 352; _Kik_, 492 F. Supp. 3d 169. Moreover, the law does not require the SEC to warn all potential violators on an individual or industry level. _See Dickerson v. Napolitano,_ 604 F.3d 732, 745–46 (2d Cir. 2010) (“Courts ask whether the law presents an ordinary person with sufficient notice of or the opportunity to understand what conduct is prohibited or proscribed, not whether a particular [party] actually received a warning that alerted him or her to the danger of being held to account for the behavior in question.” (cleaned up)).

[.text-justify]
Accordingly, the SEC’s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to the Institutional Sales and otherwise DENIED, and Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to the Programmatic Sales, the Other Distributions, and Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s sales, and DENIED as to the Institutional Sales.

&#8195;&#8195;C&#46; Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s Aiding and Abetting of Ripple’s Violations

[.text-justify]
The SEC also moves for summary judgment on its aiding and abetting claim against Larsen and Garlinghouse. _See_ SEC Mem. at 66. To establish liability for aiding and abetting a securities violation, the SEC must show: +
[.quoteblock .text-justify]#&nbsp; +
(1) the existence of a securities law violation by the primary (as opposed to the aiding and abetting) party; +
(2) knowledge of this violation on the part of the aider and abettor; and +
(3) substantial assistance by the aider and abettor in the achievement of the primary violation.#+
_SEC v. Apuzzo,_ 689 F.3d 204, 206 (2d Cir. 2012) (cleaned up). Courts cannot consider the three requirements in isolation from one another because “[s]atisfaction of the knowledge requirement will depend on the theory of primary liability, and there may be a nexus between the degree of knowledge and the requirement that the alleged aider and abettor render substantial assistance.” _SEC v. Espuelas,_ 905 F. Supp. 2d 507, 517 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting _SEC v. DiBella,_ 587 F.3d 553, 566 (2d Cir. 2009)). Indeed, courts have found that “‘[a] high degree of substantial assistance may lessen the SEC’s burden in proving scienter’ and vice versa.” _SEC v. Wey,_ 246 F. Supp. 3d 894, 928 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (quoting _Apuzzo,_ 689 F.3d at 215).

[.text-justify]
As to the first requirement, the Court has already held that Ripple’s Institutional Sales constituted the unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act. _See supra_ § II.B.1.

[.text-justify]
With respect to the second requirement, to show knowledge of Ripple’s violations, the SEC must demonstrate Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s “general awareness of their overall role in Ripple’s illegal scheme.” MTD Order at 15; _see SEC v. Yorkville Advisors, LLC,_ 305 F. Supp. 3d 486, 511 (S.D.N.Y. 2018); Dodd-Frank Wall St. Reform & Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, § 929O (2010) (codified at 15 U.S.C. § 78t(e)). The SEC need not demonstrate that Larsen and Garlinghouse were aware that Ripple’s transactions and schemes were illegal. _See SEC v. Mattessich,_ 407 F. Supp. 3d 264, 272–73 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). Rather, the SEC must show that Larsen and Garlinghouse knew, or recklessly disregarded, the facts that made Ripple’s transactions and schemes illegal under statutory and caselaw. _See id._

[.text-justify]
Based on the record, Defendants have raised a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Larsen and Garlinghouse knew or recklessly disregarded the facts that made Ripple’s scheme illegal. _See_ MTD Order at 15. It is not clear whether Larsen and Garlinghouse knew or recklessly disregarded that securities laws, rather than laws under other regulatory regimes, applied to XRP. For instance, Larsen and Garlinghouse testified that they did not believe XRP was a security because multiple foreign regulators, including regulators in Japan, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom, had determined that XRP was not a security. SEC Add. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 1744, 1782. Larsen and Garlinghouse also stated that when the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network labeled XRP a “virtual currency” in 2015, they understood this as an “official United States government declaration that XRP [was] a currency” and “exempt from [U.S.] securities laws.” _Id._ ¶¶ 1734, 1759–60. Larsen further testified that he understood the 2018 speech by the then-Director of the SEC Division of Corporate Finance, Bill Hinman—in which he stated that neither bitcoin nor ether (another digital asset) were securities—to further reinforce the SEC’s position that XRP was not a security. _See id._ ¶¶ 1742–43.

[.text-justify]
The October 2012 Perkins Coie memorandum, which Larsen reviewed, advises, “[a]lthough we believe that a compelling argument can be made that [XRP tokens] do not constitute ‘securities’ under the federal securities laws, given the lack of applicable [caselaw], we believe that there is some risk, albeit small, that the [SEC] disagrees with our analysis.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 993; _see_ ECF No. 846-30 at 6. Larsen testified that after receiving the memorandum, Ripple took specific steps to ensure compliance with the advice contained within the memorandum. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 1730.

[.text-justify]
Likewise, Defendants have raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Larsen and Garlinghouse knew or recklessly disregarded facts about each of the _Howey_ elements. For example, Defendants have adduced evidence that Larsen and Garlinghouse did not know that Ripple’s Institutional Sales of XRP satisfied the _Howey_ “common enterprise” element because they did not believe that the proceeds from the sales were pooled and understood that Ripple did not manage, operate, or control the XRP Ledger or the broader “XRP ecosystem.” _See id._ ¶¶ 1748–50. Based on the disputed facts in the record, therefore, a reasonable juror could find that Larsen and Garlinghouse did not know or recklessly disregard Ripple’s Section 5 violations. _See Apuzzo,_ 689 F.3d at 206.

[.text-justify]
As to the third requirement, Defendants concede that Larsen, as Ripple’s CEO prior to 2017, provided substantial assistance, and Garlinghouse, after becoming Ripple’s CEO in January 2017, provided substantial assistance. _See_ Defs. Opp. at 71. However, Larsen claims that he did not provide substantial assistance during his time as Executive Chairman of Ripple’s Board, starting in 2017. _See id._

[.text-justify]
To satisfy the substantial assistance component of aiding and abetting, the “SEC must show that the defendant in some sort associated himself with the venture, that he participated in it as in something that he wished to bring about, and that he sought by his action to make it succeed.” _Apuzzo,_ 689 F.3d at 206 (cleaned up). In other words, the defendant must “consciously assist the commission of the specific crime in some active way.” _SEC v. Mudd,_ 885 F. Supp. 2d 654, 670–71 (S.D.N.Y. 2012).

[.text-justify]
Here, Larsen has raised a triable issue of material fact as to whether he provided “substantial assistance” beginning in 2017. _See Anderson,_ 477 U.S. at 248. The record establishes that, starting in 2017, Larsen moved away from a day-to-day operational role at Ripple. _See_ SEC Add. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 1722–29. But after he stepped down as CEO, Larsen also continued his role on the XRP Sales Committee, which approved Ripple’s sales of XRP. _See_ Defs. 56.1 Resp. Part 2 ¶ 1099, ECF No. 835-1. The Court concludes, therefore, that a reasonable jury could find that, starting in 2017, Larsen did not “consciously assist [Ripple’s Section 5 violations] in some active way.” _Mudd,_ 885 F. Supp. 2d at 670–71.

[.text-justify]
Accordingly, the SEC’s motion for summary judgment on the aiding and abetting claim against Larsen and Garlinghouse is DENIED.

[.text-center]
*CONCLUSION*

[.text-justify]
&#8195;For the foregoing reasons, the SEC’s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to the Institutional Sales, and otherwise DENIED. Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to the Programmatic Sales, the Other Distributions, and Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s sales, and DENIED as to the Institutional Sales.

[underline]#OPINION AND ORDER#
|===
JED S. RAKOFF, U.S.D.J.:

[.text-justify]
In this case, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) alleges that the defendants -- Terraform Labs Pte. Ltd., a “cryptoassets” company, and its founder, Do Hyeong Kwon –- orchestrated a multi-billion-dollar fraud involving the development, marketing, and sale of various cryptocurrencies. The SEC’s claims, all brought under the federal securities laws, include a claim that defendants offered and sold unregistered securities, claims that defendants offered and effected transactions in unregistered security-based swaps, and claims that defendants engaged in fraudulent schemes to lead investors astray. One of the alleged fraudulent schemes is that defendants misrepresented that one of Terraform’s crypto asset securities, UST, was permanently pegged to a $1.00 price through an automatic self-stabilizing algorithm, rather than through the intervention of a third-party trading firm with whom defendants struck a secret deal. Another of the alleged fraudulent schemes is that  defendants falsely stated that a Korean mobile payment application, Chai, used the Terraform blockchain to process and settle transactions in cryptocurrencies, a lie that defendants concealed by replicating purported Chai transactions on a Terraform server.
[.text-justify]
In support of its fraud claims, the SEC offers two expert witnesses: Dr. Bruce Mizrach and Dr. Matthew Edman. In response, defendants offer three expert witnesses of their own: Dr. Terrence Hendershott (as rebuttal to Dr. Mizrach), Mr. Raj Unny (as rebuttal to Dr. Edman), and Dr. Christine Parlour. Each side moved under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 to exclude the other side’s experts, and the Court, after receiving full briefing, held a “[underline]#Daubert#” hearing on those motions on November 17, 2023, at which it questioned all five putative experts. On November 20, 2023, the Court issued a “bottom-line” order denying defendants’ motions to exclude the testimony of Dr. Mizrach and Dr. Edman, denying the SEC’s motion to exclude the testimony of Dr. Hendershott, and granting the SEC’s motions to exclude the testimony of Mr. Unny and Dr. Parlour. Below, the Court explains the reasons for those rulings.
[.text-justify]
In addition, this Opinion and Order disposes of the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment, on which the Court received full briefing and held oral argument on November 30, 2023. As the Court explains below, the Court grants summary judgment for the SEC on the claim that defendants offered and sold unregistered securities. The Court grants summary judgment for defendants on the claims involving offering and effecting transactions in security-based swaps. Finally, the Court denies’ both sides’ cross-motions for summary judgment on the fraud claims.


&#8195;I&#46;&#8195;&#8195; [underline]#Factual and Procedural Background#

[.text-justify]
Defendant Do Hyeong Kwon, along with an individual named Daniel Shin, founded Terraform Labs Pte. Ltd. (“Terraform”) in April 2018. ECF No. 124 (“Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1”), at ¶¶ 1-2. In April 2019, Terraform and Kwon launched and promoted the Terraform blockchain, which would record and display transactions of cryptocurrency tokens, or crypto assets, across computers in a linked network. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 25; ECF No. 126 (“SEC Resp. to Defs.’ 56.1”), at ¶¶ 10-13.

&#8195;&#8195;A&#46;&#8195; [underline]#LUNA and wLUNA#

[.text-justify]
Terraform coded into the blockchain at launch one billion tokens of a particular crypto asset, LUNA, that it created. Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶ 25. Beginning even before the blockchain was developed, Terraform entered agreements to sell LUNA to buyers in exchange for both fiat currency and other crypto assets, such
as Bitcoin. [underline]#Id.# ¶¶ 51, 117; [underline]#e.g.#, ECF No. 73, Ex. 26 (July 11, 2018 token sale agreement for an institutional investor to purchase LUNA tokens from Terraform for $3,000,000 worth of Bitcoin). The terms of those agreements referred to an “Initial Token Launch,” which was defined as “the online sale and/or distribution of Tokens by the Vendor [Terraform or its subsidiary Terraform BVI] to the general public in a campaign to be initiated and conducted by the Vendor.” Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶ 118.
[.text-justify]
The agreements further contemplated that “Terraform would undertake efforts to generate a secondary trading  market for the LUNA tokens.” [underline]#Id.# The terms of the sales provided incentives for the purchasers to resell LUNA tokens by, for example, setting the purchase price at discounts of 40% or more from expected market prices. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 119. In a fundraising update in December 2018, Terraform co-founder Daniel Shin wrote that Terraform had “begun exchange listing discussions given token listing is a precondition for Terra/Luna ecosystem to operate.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 121. Terraform used proceeds from selling LUNA to, in part, fund Terraform’s operating costs. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 56.
[.text-justify]
In November 2019 and September 2020, Kwon negotiated and signed, on behalf of Terraform, agreements with a U.S. crypto asset trading firm, Jump Crypto Holdings LLC (“Jump”), to receive loans of 30 million and 65 million LUNA tokens, respectively. [underline]#Id.# ¶¶ 124, 130. In a January 13, 2020 email to “Terra’s leading investor
group,” Kwon announced that Terraform had “agreed to enter a partnership with Jump,” in which Jump would “deploy its own resources to improve liquidity of Terra and Luna.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 126. Kwon stated that, until then, LUNA’s liquidity had been “rather lackluster partly due to our team’s inexperience with secondary markets & trading operations.” [underline]#Id.# Kwon further explained that Terraform’s loan of LUNA tokens to Jump was “with the expectation that they are going to fill bids and offers to improve liquidity of LUNA in secondary trading markets.” [underline]#Id.# Moreover, Kwon acknowledged that Jump later provided periodic reports to
Terraform of its trading on various crypto asset trading platforms. [underline]#Id.# The second loan agreement, in September 2020, came about because a Jump executive emailed Kwon a proposal to obtain tens of millions of additional LUNA tokens at a discounted price to “thicken up LUNA markets further.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 129. 
[.text-justify]
In a Tweet on April 7, 2021, Kwon wrote: “A bet on the moon [LUNA] is very simple: it goes up in value (inc. scarcity) the more Terra money is used; it goes down in value (inc. dilution) the less Terra money is used. The moon’s fate in the long run is tied to how widely the money gets used and transacted.” ECF No. 75, Ex. 105. In another post that day, Kwon wrote: “But in the long run, $Luna value is actionable –- it grows as the [Terraform]ecosystem grows. As a holder of the [moon], you then have three choices: Sit back and watch me kick ass; Take profits and buy unvaluable assets; Or you can roll up your sleeves and build cool shit.” [underline]#Id.#, Ex. 108. Around the same time, SJ Park, Director of Special Projects at Terraform, stated in a videotaped presentation that “[o]wning LUNA is essentially owning a stake in the network and a bet that value will continue to accrue over time.” Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶ 63. In a public interview, Jeff Kuan, business development lead at Terraform, explained that “VCs investing in Terra means they’re buying LUNA, which is the ‘equity’ in our co.” [underline]#Id.# The price of LUNA increased from under $1.00 in January 2021 to a high of over $119 in April 2022, before plummeting to under a penny in May 2022. ECF No. 175, Ex. 125. 

&#8195;&#8195;B&#46;&#8195; [underline]#UST and the Anchor Protocol#
[.text-justify]
In December 2019, Terraform created another crypto asset called UST, which it described as a “stablecoin” whose value was permanently and algorithmically pegged to one U.S. dollar. Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶¶ 21–24. As part of the algorithm, one UST could always be exchanged for $1 worth of LUNA, and $1 worth of LUNA could always be exchanged for one UST. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 23. In March 2021, Terraform launched “the Anchor Protocol,” which it described as a key component of “the Terra money market,” allowing UST holders to earn interest payments by depositing their tokens in a shared pool from which others could borrow UST. ECF No. 73, Ex. 44 at 2; [underline]#Id.#, Ex. 67. Terraform publicly announced, in a Tweet by Kwon, that “Anchor will target 20% fixed APR,” which was “by far the highest stablecoin yield in the market.” [underline]#Id.#, Ex. 66. A June 2020 white paper described the Anchor Protocol as “an attempt to give the main street investor a single, reliable, rate of return across all blockchains.” [underline]#Id.#, Ex. 44 at 2.

Returns from the Anchor Protocol were paid out in proportion to the amount of UST a person or entity had deposited. Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶ 80. The Anchor Protocol website stated that “[d]eposited stablecoins are pooled and lent out to borrowers, with accrued interest pro-rata distributed to all depositors.” [underline]#Id.# By May 2022, there were approximately 18.5 billion tokens of UST, 14 billion of which had been deposited in the Anchor Protocol. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 36.

&#8195;&#8195;C&#46;&#8195; [underline]#MIR, the Mirror Protocol, and mAssets#
[.text-justify]
In December 2020, Terraform launched “the Mirror Protocol.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 38. The Mirror Protocol allowed users to obtain “mAssets” -- tokens whose value would “mirror” the price of a pre-existing non-crypto asset, such as a publicly traded security. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 39. A Mirror Protocol user could mint an mAsset by depositing collateral of 150% or more of the value of the underlying security (the “reference stock”). [underline]#Id.# ¶ 113. The holder of the mAsset would thus hold the value of the deposit without holding the underlying reference stock or its attendant ownership interests. There was a catch, however. Whenever the price of the underlying reference stock rose above the holder’s initial buy-in, the holder would need to deposit additional collateral to maintain the mAsset. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 114. In other words, there is no evidence that suggests, and the SEC does not contend, that an mAsset would lead to profit for its holders or that any holders expected as much.
[.text-justify]
The same was not true, however, for the Mirror Protocol’s governance token, MIR. MIR’s value was based on the Mirror Protocol’s usage. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 38. A Terraform subsidiary sold MIR tokens directly to purchasers through “Simple Agreements for Farmed Tokens,” or SAFTs. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 135. Those agreements did not restrict purchasers from reselling their MIR tokens in secondary trading markets or to U.S. investors. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 136. Terraform also loaned as many as 4 million MIR tokens to Jump, in an agreement that expressly required Jump to trade MIR tokens on crypto asset trading platforms and to provide Terraform with reports of its trading. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 138. Terraform also sold LUNA and MIR tokens to secondary market purchasers on Binance and other crypto trading exchanges. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 142. The record provides no evidence that Terraform took steps to determine whether those trading platforms were available to U.S. investors. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 143.
[.text-justify]
In September 2020, Kwon emailed promotional materials to a potential purchaser, including a set of slides that described MIR as “a farmable governance token that earns fees from asset trades.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 101. Another slide proclaimed that the “Mirror token will accrue value from network fees and governance” and stated that MIR token holders could receive “trading fee revenues.” [underline]#Id.# Kwon even included in those materials a spreadsheet with a revenue projection table, estimating how the price of MIR would increase in tandem with greater usage of the Mirror Protocol. [underline]#Id.#; ECF No. 75, Ex. 148. In a June 2021 presentation, SJ Park, Terraform’s Director of Special Projects, stated that the Mirror Protocol had “grown to two billion [dollars] in total value locked and a billion [dollars] in liquidity.” Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶ 110.

&#8195;&#8195;D&#46;&#8195; [underline]#Chai’s Use of the Terraform Blockchain#
[.text-justify]
In mid-2019, Terraform’s co-founder Daniel Shin developed Chai, a Korean mobile payment application. [underline]#Id.# ¶¶ 150-51. Terraform and Chai were closely associated until early 2020, including sharing office space and overlapping personnel. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 153. In a July 26, 2019 Terraform “Community Update,” Kwon wrote that “Chai launched using the Terra Protocol, and . . . already it is one of the most heavily used blockchain applications in existence.”[underline]#Id.# ¶ 168. In a February 9, 2020 Terraform chat message available to the public, Kwon stated that “Chai has 12 merchants, all of whom get settled in KRT [a crypto asset pegged to the Korean fiat currency, the won] on the Terraform blockchain.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 173. In an April 16, 2021 interview, Kwon stated that by paying “merchants directly in stablecoin, we’re able to cut down settlement times from seven days to six seconds, which [is] the average block time of the entire blockchain.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 181. In another public interview, on March 31, 2022, Kwon added that “the idea was that we could, you know, bootstrap a large network of merchants and users that are willing to transact using Terra.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 182.
[.text-justify]
According to the SEC, however, the above statements were misrepresentations because Chai never used the Terraform
blockchain to process transactions. In a May 26, 2020 email, a Chai employee explained that Chai would “process transaction[s] outside [the] blockchain” and then “write a record on the Terra blockchain in parallel.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 185. In a May 9, 2019 message, Kwon told Shin that he would “do fake transactions on the mainnet to generate staking returns of SDT,” another Terraform crypto asset. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 187. Kwon added, “[I] can just create fake transactions that look real which will generate fees and we can wind down as chai grows.” [underline]#Id.# When asked by Shin whether people would learn that the transactions were fake, Kwon responded, “All power to those that can prove it[’]s fake because I will try my best to make it indiscernable.”[underline]#Id.#
[.text-justify]
Shortly thereafter, Terraform developed what became known as the “LP Server.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 188. On October 9, 2020, a Terraform engineer messaged another Terraform employee, Paul Kim, to ask, “can you quickly explain me what’s the role of the lp-server?”[underline]#Id.# ¶ 200. Kim responded, “lp-server creates multisend  transactions by receiving transaction information from Chai,” adding, “[i]n short: it basically replicates chai transactions.” [underline]#Id.# Jihoon Kim, a former Terraform employee who had left to join Chai as lead engineer for its e-wallet and card business, told Chai’s Chief Product Officer –- an SEC whistleblower in this case -- that “there’s no crypto going on within Chai.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 186. When that whistleblower confronted Kwon in September 2021 about the fact that Chai did not really use the Terraform blockchain, Kwon did not deny the allegation but stated merely that he did not “give a fuck about Chai.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 183.

&#8195;&#8195;E&#46;&#8195; [underline]#UST’s May 2021 Depeg#
[.text-justify]
On May 19, 2021, UST’s price fell below $1. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 209. On May 23, 2021, it dropped to around $0.90. [underline]#Id.# That same day, Kwon had multiple communications with a Jump executive. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 210. When asked about those communications at a deposition, that Jump executive –- as well as another -- invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 211. The SEC asserts that Terraform reached a deal with Jump to take action to restore UST’s $1 peg, and that, in return, Jump would no longer be required to achieve vesting conditions to receive additional LUNA tokens under earlier agreements. [underline]#Id.# On the day in question, May 23, 2021, a different Jump executive told employees, “I spoke to Do [Kwon] and he’s going to vest us.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 214. The same day, Kwon told Terraform’s head of business development that he was “speaking to jump about a solution.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 217. Terraform’s head of communications, Brian Curran, took notes at a division head meeting that day, writing that Kwon announced that the “[p]eg had to be defended”  and that “Jump was deploying $100 million to buyback UST.” [underline]#Id.# ¶¶ 217-18. Indeed, Jump purchased large amounts of UST in bursts that day, and UST’s market price was eventually restored to near $1.00. [underline]#Id.# ¶¶ 214-15. Later that year, Kwon told Curran that if Jump had not stepped in, Terraform “actually might’ve been fucked.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 219. Another Terraform employee added that “they [Jump] saved our ass.” [underline]#Id.#
[.text-justify]
On May 24, 2021, after UST’s price had largely recovered, Terraform published dozens of Tweets describing the benefits of “algorithmic, calibrated adjustments of economic parameters” as compared to the “stress-induced decision-making of human agents in [a] time of market volatility.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 222. Terraform referred to UST’s $1 peg as the “lynchpin for the entire [Terra] ecosystem” and described the depeg and repeg as a “black swan” event that was “as intense of a stress test in live conditions as can ever be expected.” [underline]#Id.# In a June 2021 Terraform Community Update, Terraform stated that “[i]ndustry-wide volatility stress-tested the stability mechanism of the Terra protocol.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 223. 
[.text-justify]
Kwon discussed the depeg again in a May 2022 talk show appearance, at which he pronounced that the UST algorithmic “protocol automatically self-heals the exchanged rate” and that “it took a few days for the slippage cost to naturally heal back to spot.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 224. Later that same month, however, Terraform’s crypto assets lost nearly all of their value –- according to the SEC, more than $45 billion -- and have not recovered. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 49.

&#8195;&#8195;E&#46;&#8195; [underline]#Procedural History#
[.text-justify]
The SEC filed this action against Terraform and Kwon on February 16, 2023 and filed an Amended Complaint on April 3, 2023. [underline]#See# ECF Nos. 1, 25. The Amended Complaint contains six claims for relief: fraud in the offer or sale of securities in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act (Count I); fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities in violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and accompanying Rule 10b-5 (Count II); control person liability against Kwon under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, for the Section 10(b) violation (Count III); offering and selling unregistered securities in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act (Count IV); offering unregistered security-based swaps to non-eligible contract participants in violation of Section 5(e) of the Securities Act (Count V); and effecting transactions in unregistered security-based swaps with non-eligible contract participants in violation of Section 6(l) of the Exchange Act (Count VI). 
[.text-justify]
Defendants timely moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint on a smattering of grounds, including, among others, the argument that none of the crypto assets at issue is a security. [underline]#See# ECF No. 29. After full briefing and oral argument, the Court denied the motion to dismiss. [underline]#See# ECF No. 51. Discovery closed on October 27, 2023. [underline]#See# ECF No. 44. Each side moved under Rule 702 to exclude the expert witnesses of the other, and after full briefing, the Court heard oral argument on those motions on November 17, 2023. On November 20, 2023, the Court issued a “bottom-line” order granting the motions to exclude two of defendants’ three experts, but denying the motions to exclude defendants’ other expert and the SEC’s two experts. [underline]#See# ECF No. 130. This Opinion and Order first explains the reasons for those Rule 702 rulings, and then goes on to resolve the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment, on which the Court heard oral argument on November 30, 2023 after full briefing.

&#8195;III&#46;&#8195;&#8195; [underline]#Motions for Summary Judgment#

&#8195;&#8195;A&#46;&#8195; [underline]#Offering and Selling Unregistered Securities#

&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;1&#46; [underline]#There is no genuine dispute that UST, LUNA, wLUNA, and MIR are securities because they are investment contracts.#
[.text-justify]
The SEC argues that four of Terraform’s crypto assets –- UST, LUNA, wLUNA, and MIR –- are securities, as defined in Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act for the purposes of the federal securities laws, because they are “investment contract[s].” 15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(1). Defendants first argue that, even if all the SEC’s allegations are credited, those assets are not investment contracts as a matter of law. In the alternative, defendants contest the SEC’s assertion that undisputed facts do indeed demonstrate that the crypto assets here at issue are investment contracts.
[.text-justify]
Defendants’ first argument in effect asks this Court to cast aside decades of settled law of the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit. In the seminal decision of [underline]#SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.#, 328 U.S. 293 (1946), the Supreme Court held in no uncertain terms that “an investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.” [underline]#Id.# at 298-99. Defendants urge this Court to scrap that definition, deeming it “dicta” that is the product of statutory interpretation of a bygone era. The Court declines defendants’ invitation. [underline]#Howey#’s definition of “investment contract” was and remains a binding statement of the law, not dicta. And even if, in some conceivable reality, the Supreme Court intended the definition to be dicta, that is of no moment because the Second Circuit has likewise adopted the [underline]#Howey# test as the law. [underline]#See, e.g.#, [underline]#Revak v. SEC Realty Corp.#, 18 F.3d 81, 87 (2d Cir. 1994).
[.text-justify]
There is no genuine dispute that the elements of the [underline]#Howey# test –- “(i) investment of money (ii) in a common enterprise (iii) with profits to be derived solely from the efforts of others” (id.) –- have been met for UST, LUNA, wLUNA, and MIR.
[.text-justify]
[underline]#UST#. Defendants make much of the fact, undisputed by the SEC, that UST on its own was not a security because purchasers understood that its value would remain stable at $1.00 rather than generate a profit. But, beginning in March 2021, holders of UST could deposit their tokens in the Anchor Protocol, which defendants’ efforts developed and which Kwon himself publicly announced would generate “by far the highest stablecoin yield in the market,” with a “target” of “20% fixed APR.” ECF No. 73, Ex. 66; [underline]#Id.#, Ex. 67. On May 11, 2021, Terraform wrote in a promotional Tweet that the Anchor Protocol would allow “third parties to seamlessly integrate 20% yield on $UST to expand stable savings opportunities to a greater audience.” [underline]#Id.#, Ex. 135. A 2020 white paper described Terraform’s work on the Anchor Protocol as “an attempt to give the main street investor a single, reliable, rate of return across all blockchains.” [underline]#Id.#, Ex. 44 at 2.
[.text-justify]
Once launched, returns from the Anchor Protocol were indeed paid out in proportion to the amount of UST tokens a person or entity had deposited. Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶ 80. The Anchor Protocol website stated that “[d]eposited stablecoins are pooled and lent out to borrowers, with accrued interest pro-rata distributed to all depositors.” [underline]#Id.# Terraform promoted in an October 2021 Tweet that it had configured its website to allow deposits of UST into the Anchor Protocol “directly from the Terra Station desktop wallet.” ECF No. 75, Ex. 136. A Terraform manager, Matthew Cantieri, led a team that worked on the Anchor Protocol. Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶ 83. His responsibilities included the ”strategic direction of the protocol, user adoption, making sure that people were accountable for product roadmap items, [and] working with Do [Kwon] and the team on what those products should be.” [underline]#Id.# By May 2022, there were approximately 18.5 billion tokens of UST, 14 billion of which had been deposited in the Anchor Protocol. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 36.
[.text-justify]
The above undisputed evidence clearly demonstrates that UST in combination with the Anchor Protocol constituted an investment contract. As the Supreme Court has held, it is of no legal consequence that not all holders of UST deposited tokens in the Anchor Protocol, and thus that some holders “ch[o]se not to accept the full offer of an investment contract.” [underline]#Howey#, 328 U.S. at 300. 
[.text-justify]
[underline]#LUNA and wLUNA#. Defendants’ efforts to rebut the evidence that LUNA and wLUNA were securities are even further off the mark. In denying the motion to dismiss, the Court held that, “by alleging that the defendants ‘pooled’ the proceeds of LUNA purchases together and promised that further investment through these purchases would benefit all LUNA holders, the SEC has adequately pled that the defendants and the investors were joined in a common, profit-seeking enterprise.” ECF No. 51, at 37. Those well-pleaded allegations have now been substantiated with undisputed evidence. 
[.text-justify]
Kwon and others made specific, repeated statements that would lead a reasonable investor in LUNA to expect a profit based on defendants’ efforts to further develop the Terraform blockchain.
Terraform’s business development lead, Jeff Kuan, stated in a 2021 public interview that “investing in Terra means . . . buying LUNA, which is the ‘equity’ in our co.” Response to SEC 56.1 ¶ 63. Terraform’s head of communications, Brian Curran, remarked in a June 2021 public interview that “[o]wning LUNA is equivalent to owning a stake in the transaction fees of a network like Visa” because “[a]ll the transaction fees from Terra stablecoins are distributed to LUNA stakers in the form of staking rewards.” ECF No. 75, Ex. 107.
[.text-justify]
In a similar vein, Terraform’s Director of Special Projects, SJ Park, stated in a videotaped presentation around the same time that “[o]wning LUNA is essentially owning a stake in the network and a bet that value will continue to accrue over time.” Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶ 63. And Kwon himself wrote in a public Tweet that “$Luna value is actionable –- it grows as the [Terraform] ecosystem grows.” ECF No. 75, Ex. 108. In Kwon’s own words, a holder of LUNA could simply “[s]it back and watch [him] kick ass.” [underline]#Id.# In other words, a person could invest their “money in a common enterprise” and be “led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party,” namely, Terraform and Do Kwon himself. [underline]#Howey#, 328 U.S. at 299. Indeed, the price of LUNA increased from under $1.00 in January 2021 to a high of over $119 in April 2022, before plummeting to under a penny in May 2022. ECF No. 75, Ex. 125.
[.text-justify]
[underline]#MIR#. Finally, the evidence shows beyond dispute that MIR was a security for similar reasons. “[T]he proceeds from sales of the MIR tokens were ‘pooled together’ to improve the Mirror Protocol,” and “[p]rofits derived from the use of the Mirror Protocol . . . were fed back to investors based on the size of their investment.” ECF No. 51, at 37. Terraform described MIR as a “governance token that earns fees from asset trades” on the Mirror Protocol that Terraform launched. Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶¶ 38, 101; ECF No. 73, Ex. 80. A Terraform press release at the launch of the Mirror Protocol touted that “[b]y adding the Mirror governance token –- MIR -- to liquidity pools, MIR holders can earn 0.25% from trading fees.” ECF No. 73, Ex. 80. Although Terraform labeled “the protocol [as] decentralized,” it explained that “the team behind Terra contributed most of the core development work behind the Mirror.” [underline]#Id.# Kwon himself sent promotional materials to a potential MIR purchaser, including a spreadsheet with a revenue projection table estimating how the price of MIR would increase as a result of greater usage of the Mirror Protocol. ECF No. 75, Ex. 148.
[.text-justify]
Terraform also described to potential investors its efforts to strengthen the Mirror Protocol, such as “deploying its UST reserves to make the markets for mAssets for the first year of the protocol,” building the Mirror Protocol website and hiring a firm to audit Terraform’s code for doing so, and publishing “dashboards” showing the Mirror Protocol’s growth. Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶¶ 102, 103, 107. In a public question-and-answer session, Terraform’s Community Lead, Aayush Gupta, stated on behalf of Terraform that the company was “very upbeat on our marketing campaign” and was “doing [its] best with its global suite of talent and organizing stuff like trading competitions and referral campaign to increase visibility for Mirror.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 108. In an April 2021 interview, Terraform’s head of communications, Brian Curran, stated that Terraform intended to launch a “V2” of the Mirror Protocol, which would bring “several major improvements,” and that Terraform planned to expand the Mirror Protocol “beyond SE Asia and the typical US market.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 109. Terraform employed a “product manager” for the Mirror Protocol and retained an administrative key to provide software updates to it. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 111. Terraform used proceeds from the sale of MIR, which it pooled, “to make payments for services, salary, and operations.” ECF No. 77, at ¶ 25; [underline]#see Id.# at ¶¶ 29-32.
[.text-justify]
In light of all this, defendants cannot meaningfully dispute that they led holders of MIR to expect profit from a common enterprise based on Terraform’s efforts to develop, maintain, and grow the Mirror Protocol -- in other words, that MIR passes the [underline]#Howey# test with flying colors. 

&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;2&#46; [underline]#There is no genuine dispute that defendants offered and sold unregistered securities, in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.#
[.text-justify]
The Court grants summary judgment to the SEC on Count IV of the Amended Complaint because defendants offered and sold unregistered securities, in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. In particular, defendants offered and sold LUNA and MIR in unregistered transactions.
[.text-justify]
“Section 5 requires that securities be registered with the SEC before any person may sell or offer to sell such securities.” [underline]#SEC v. Cavanagh#, 445 F.3d 105, 111 (2d Cir. 2006). Section 5(a) covers unregistered sales and Section 5(c) covers unregistered offers. [underline]#See# 15 U.S.C. § 77e(a), (c). To prove liability under Section 5, the SEC must show “(1) lack of a registration statement as to the subject securities; (2) the offer or sale of the securities; and (3) the use of interstate transportation or communication and the mails in connection with the offer or sale.” [underline]#Cavanagh#, 445 F.3d at 111 n.13. Only the second element is contested here.
[.text-justify]
Terraform sold LUNA tokens directly to institutional investors through sales agreements that expressly contemplated Terraform’s development of a secondary market. Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶¶ 117–19. The terms of those agreements provided a builtin incentive for secondary resale because Terraform sold LUNA to
initial investors at discounts of up to, and sometimes more than, 40%. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 119. In a fundraising update in December 2018, Terraform co-founder Daniel Shin wrote that Terraform had “begun exchange listing discussions given token listing is a precondition for [the] Terra/Luna ecosystem to operate.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 121. Similarly, as Terraform provided loans of tens of millions of LUNA tokens to trading firm Jump, Kwon announced Terraform’s expectation that Jump would “improve liquidity of LUNA in secondary trading markets.” [underline]#Id.# ¶ 126. Kwon stated that, before Jump’s involvement, LUNA’s liquidity had been “rather lackluster partly due to our team’s inexperience with secondary markets & trading operations.” [underline]#Id.#
[.text-justify]
Terraform’s offers and sales of MIR were similar. A Terraform subsidiary sold MIR tokens directly to purchasers through “Simple Agreements for Farmed Tokens,” or SAFTs. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 135. Those agreements did not restrict purchasers from reselling their MIR tokens in secondary trading markets or to U.S. investors. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 136. Terraform also loaned up to 4 million MIR tokens to Jump, in an agreement that expressly required Jump to trade MIR tokens on crypto asset trading platforms and to provide Terraform with reports of its trading. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 138. Terraform also sold both LUNA and MIR tokens to secondary market purchasers on Binance and other crypto trading exchanges. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 142. The record provides no evidence that Terraform took steps to determine whether those trading platforms were available to U.S. investors. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 143.
[.text-justify]
Defendants argue that even if LUNA and MIR were securities, they were exempt from registration. But “[o]nce a prima facie case” of Section 5 liability “has been made, the defendant bears the burden of proving the applicability of an exemption.” [underline]#Cavanagh#, 445 F.3d at 111 n.13. Defendants have not carried that burden here.
[.text-justify]
Defendants contend that their distributions of LUNA and MIR were not public offerings because they only sold directly to sophisticated investors. [underline]#See# ECF No. 100 (“Defs.’ Mem.”), at 25–27; [underline]#SEC v. Ralston Purina Co.#, 346 U.S. 119, 125 (“An offering to those who are shown to be able to fend for themselves is a transaction ‘not involving any public offering.’”). But to avail themselves of that exemption, defendants would need to also show that they “intended” the LUNA and MIR tokens “to come to rest with” those sophisticated investors. [underline]#SEC v. Telegram Grp. Inc.#, 448 F. Supp. 3d 352, 380 (S.D.N.Y. 2020). The natural problem for defendants is that “securities do not come to rest with investors who intend a further distribution.” [underline]#Id.# at 380. Terraform’s own repeated statements about developing a liquid secondary market for LUNA, and its express requirement that Jump trade MIR on exchanges -- and even that Jump provide reports to Terraform about that secondary trading -- make plain that neither Terraform nor its institutional investors had any intent to simply hold onto LUNA or MIR without further trades. It is immaterial that the vesting period in certain sales agreements “precluded immediate resale” or “that LUNA was not listed on any trading platform at the time of the purchases” by those institutional investors. Defs.’ Mem. at 25.
[.text-justify]
Defendants also argue that certain sales agreements for LUNA were exempt from registration under Regulation S, which states that Section 5’s reference to offers and sales refers only to those “that occur within the United States.” 17 C.F.R. § 230.901. But defendants point to no evidence -- as they must, given that they bear the burden of proof on this exemption -- showing that they reasonably believed “at the commencement of the offering” that there was “no substantial U.S. market interest” or that they took any steps to prevent resale of LUNA and MIR into the U.S. market. [underline]#Id.# § 230.903. Conjecture that “if a purchaser intended to sell its LUNA, it could have done so without violating Section 5 by selling on any of several foreign platforms under Regulation S’s exemption,” is not evidence that purchasers limited their resales to foreign exchanges or that Terraform believed purchasers did so. Defs.’ Mem at 25-26.
[.text-justify]
The SEC is thus entitled to summary judgment of liability on Count IV of the Amended Complaint for defendants’ unregistered offers and sales of LUNA and MIR. The SEC’s motion for summary judgment made no mention of potential remedies, which will be determined once the question of liability has been resolved for all claims.

&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;3&#46; [underline]#As a matter of law, defendants did not offer or effect transactions in security-based swaps.#
[.text-justify]
The Court grants summary judgment for defendants on Counts V and VI of the Amended Complaint, alleging that  defendants offered unregistered security-based swaps to non-eligible contract participants, in violation of Section 5(e) of the Securities Act, and effected transactions in security-based swaps with noneligible contract participants, in violation of Section 6(l) of the Exchange Act. Although the SEC makes no argument that an mAsset is itself a security, [underline]#see# ECF No. 142 (“Summary Judgment Arg. Tr.”), at 6 (counsel for the SEC conceding the point), the SEC asserts that by creating and maintaining the Mirror Protocol through which others could mint mAssets, defendants offered and effected transactions in security-based swaps. The Court holds, however, that an mAsset does not meet the statutory definition of a security-based swap.
[.text-justify]
The Commodity Exchange Act defines a “swap” as “any agreement, contract, or transaction . . . that provides on an executory basis for the exchange . . . of 1 or more payments based on the value or level of 1 or more . . . securities . . . and that transfers, as between the parties to the transaction, in whole or in part, the financial risk associated with a future change in any such value or level without also conveying a current or future direct or indirect ownership interest in an asset.” 7 U.S.C. § 1a(47)(A)(iii). A “security-based swap” is such a swap that, as relevant here, “is based on . . . a single security.” 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(68). 
[.text-justify]
The Mirror Protocol’s mAssets satisfy most -- but not all -- of the definition’s requirements. A user who mints or purchases an mAsset through the Mirror Protocol indeed exchanges a payment based on the value of some underlying reference security, such as a share of Apple. Defs.’ Response to SEC 56.1 ¶¶ 112–14. And the user does so without receiving any ownership interest in the underlying security. [underline]#Id.# But, crucially, there is no transfer of financial risk involved here. Whenever the price of an underlying security increases above the user’s initial payment, or collateral, for the mAsset, the user is required to deposit additional collateral to meet the higher price. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 114. In other words, a user cannot profit from holding an mAsset because his deposit must always exceed the value of the underlying reference security. If the user fails to deposit sufficient additional collateral, the mAsset will be lost. [underline]#Id.# ¶ 114.

As a result, there is no evidence in the record showing how a holder of an mAsset transfers any “financial risk associated with a future change” in the value of a security to or from a counterparty in a transaction. 7 U.S.C. § 1a(47)(A)(iii). Rather, the holder bears all the risk for himself. The SEC nevertheless waves its hand and contends “that the financial risk is actually being transferred to the investor, to the one minting the asset.” Summary Judgment Arg. Tr. 13. But the fact that the minter of an mAsset bears financial risk from his own choice to deposit collateral, which could lead to the loss of that collateral, does not mean that any of that risk was “transfer[red]” to him by a counterparty in a transaction. 7 U.S.C. § 1a(47)(A)(iii). Instead, the minter holds the risk all along. As a result, because mAssets are not security-based swaps, the Court grants summary judgment for defendants dismissing Counts V and VI of the Amended Complaint.
