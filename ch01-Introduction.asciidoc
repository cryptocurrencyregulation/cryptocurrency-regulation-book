= Introduction =

This book is intended as a textbook for a semester-length course on cryptocurrency regulation in the United States of America.  The textbook is intended for law students or graduate students studying cryptocurrency.  
The focus of the textbook is on cryptocurrency regulation, and other topics should be supplemented by the instructor as necessary.  I provide some examples of how a course can be structured for a semester-length course based on my experience.  For example, if students need additional background materials on cryptocurrency technology, those topics are not covered in this book, but I do provide references to additional materials.  As another example, if students need additional background on some of the legal topics, I also provide references for those additional topics.
