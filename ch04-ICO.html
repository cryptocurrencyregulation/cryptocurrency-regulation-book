<p><strong>Report of Investigation Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO</strong></p>

<li>
<p><strong>Introduction and Summary</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“Commission”) Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has investigated whether The DAO, an unincorporated organization; Slock.it UG (“Slock.it”), a German corporation; Slock.it’s co-founders; and intermediaries may have violated the federal securities laws. The Commission has determined not to pursue an enforcement action in this matter based on the conduct and activities known to the Commission
at this time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>As described more fully below, The DAO is one example of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, which is a term used to describe a “virtual” organization embodied in computer code and executed on a distributed ledger or blockchain. The DAO was created by Slock.it and Slock.it’s co-founders, with the objective of operating as a for-profit entity that
would create and hold a corpus of assets through the sale of DAO Tokens to investors, which assets would then be used to fund “projects.” The holders of DAO Tokens stood to share in the anticipated earnings from these projects as a return on their investment in DAO Tokens. In addition, DAO Token holders could monetize their investments in DAO Tokens by re-selling DAO Tokens on a number of web-based platforms (“Platforms”) that supported secondary trading in the DAO Tokens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>After DAO Tokens were sold, but before The DAO was able to commence funding projects, an attacker used a flaw in The DAO’s code to steal approximately one-third of The DAO’s assets. Slock.it’s co-founders and others responded by creating a work-around whereby DAO Token holders could opt to have their investment returned to them, as described in more detail below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The investigation raised questions regarding the application of the U.S. federal securities laws to the offer and sale of DAO Tokens, including the threshold question whether DAO Tokens are securities. Based on the investigation, and under the facts presented, the Commission has determined that DAO Tokens are securities under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a> The Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to issue this report of investigation (“Report”) pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_2"><sup><strong>(2)</strong></sup></a> to advise those who would use a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (“DAO Entity”), or other distributed ledger or blockchain-enabled means for capital raising, to take appropriate steps to ensure compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws. All securities offered and sold in the United States must be registered with the Commission or must qualify for an exemption from the registration requirements. In addition, any entity or person engaging in the activities of an exchange must register as a national
securities exchange or operate pursuant to an exemption from such registration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>This Report reiterates these fundamental principles of the U.S. federal securities laws and describes their applicability to a new paradigm—virtual organizations or capital raising entities that use distributed ledger or blockchain technology to facilitate capital raising and/or investment and the related offer and sale of securities. The automation of certain functions through this technology, “smart contracts,”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_3"><sup><strong>(3)</strong></sup></a> or computer code, does not remove conduct from the purview of the U.S. federal securities laws.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_4"><sup><strong>(4)</strong></sup></a> This Report also serves to stress the obligation to comply with the registration provisions of the federal securities laws with respect to products and platforms involving emerging technologies and new investor interfaces.</p>

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>From April 30, 2016 through May 28, 2016, The DAO offered and sold approximately 1.15 billion DAO Tokens in exchange for a total of approximately 12 million Ether (“ETH”), a virtual currency<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_5"><sup><strong>(5)</strong></sup></a> used on the Ethereum Blockchain.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_6"><sup><strong>(6)</strong></sup></a>  As of the time the offering closed, the total ETH raised by The DAO was valued in U.S. Dollars (“USD”) at approximately $150 million.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The concept of a DAO Entity is memorialized in a document (the “White Paper”), authored by Christoph Jentzsch, the Chief Technology Officer of Slock.it, a “Blockchain and IoT [(internet-of-things)] solution company,” incorporated in Germany and co-founded by Christoph Jentzsch, Simon Jentzsch (Christoph Jentzsch’s brother), and Stephan Tual (“Tual”). <a href="#ico_dao_footnote_7"><sup><strong>(7)</strong></sup></a> The White Paper purports to describe “the first implementation of a [DAO Entity] code to automate organizational governance and decision making.”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_8"><sup><strong>(8)</strong></sup></a> The White Paper posits that a DAO Entity “can be used by individuals working together collaboratively outside of a traditional corporate form. It can also be used by a registered corporate entity to automate formal governance rules contained in corporate bylaws or imposed by law.” The White Paper proposes an entity—a DAO Entity—that would use smart contracts to attempt to solve governance issues it described as inherent in traditional corporations.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_9"><sup><strong>(9)</strong></sup></a> As described, a DAO Entity purportedly would supplant traditional mechanisms of corporate governance and management with a blockchain such that contractual terms are “formalized, automated and enforced using software.” <a href="#ico_dao_footnote_10"><sup><strong>(10)</strong></sup></a></p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>“The DAO” is the “first generation” implementation of the White Paper concept of a DAO Entity, and it began as an effort to create a “crowdfunding contract” to raise “funds to grow [a] company in the crypto space.”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_11"><sup><strong>(11)</strong></sup></a> In November 2015, at an Ethereum Developer Conference in London, Christoph Jentzsch described his proposal for The DAO as a “for-profit DAO [Entity],” where participants would send ETH (a virtual currency) to The DAO to purchase DAO Tokens, which would permit the participant to vote and entitle the participant to “rewards.”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_12"><sup><strong>(12)</strong></sup></a> Christoph Jentzsch likened this to “buying shares in a company and getting … dividends.”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_13"><sup><strong>(13)</strong></sup></a> The DAO was to be “decentralized” in that it would allow for voting by investors holding DAO Tokens.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_14"><sup><strong>(14)</strong></sup></a> All funds raised were to be held at an Ethereum Blockchain “address” associated with The DAO and DAO Token holders were to vote on contract proposals, including proposals to The DAO to fund projects and distribute The DAO’s anticipated earnings from the projects it
funded. <a href="#ico_dao_footnote_15"><sup><strong>(15)</strong></sup></a> The DAO was intended to be “autonomous” in that project proposals were in the form of smart contracts that exist on the Ethereum Blockchain and the votes were administered by the code of The DAO.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_16"><sup><strong>(16)</strong></sup></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>On or about April 29, 2016, Slock.it deployed The DAO code on the Ethereum Blockchain, as a set of pre-programmed instructions. <a href="#ico_dao_footnote_17"><sup><strong>(17)</strong></sup></a> This code was to govern how The DAO was to operate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>To promote The DAO, Slock.it’s co-founders launched a website (“The DAO Website”). The DAO Website included a description of The DAO’s intended purpose: “To blaze a new path in business for the betterment of its members, existing simultaneously nowhere and everywhere and operating solely with the steadfast iron will of unstoppable code.”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_18"><sup><strong>(18)</strong></sup></a> The DAO Website also described how The DAO operated, and included a link through which DAO Tokens could be purchased. The DAO Website also included a link to the White Paper, which provided detailed information about a DAO Entity’s structure and its source code and, together with The DAO Website, served as the primary source of promotional materials for The DAO. On The DAO Website and elsewhere, Slock.it represented that The DAO’s source code had been reviewed by “one of the world’s leading security audit companies” and “no stone was left unturned during those five whole days of security analysis.”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_19"><sup><strong>(19)</strong></sup></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Slock.it’s co-founders also promoted The DAO by soliciting media attention and by
posting almost daily updates on The DAO’s status on The DAO and Slock.it websites and
numerous online forums relating to blockchain technology. Slock.it’s co-founders used these
posts to communicate to the public information about how to participate in The DAO, including:
how to create and acquire DAO Tokens; the framework for submitting proposals for projects;
and how to vote on proposals. Slock.it also created an online forum on The DAO Website, as
well as administered “The DAO Slack” channel, an online messaging platform in which over
5,000 invited “team members” could discuss and exchange ideas about The DAO in real time.</p>

<p><em>DAO Tokens</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In exchange for ETH, The DAO created DAO Tokens (proportional to the amount of ETH paid) that were then assigned to the Ethereum Blockchain address of the person or entity remitting the ETH. A DAO Token granted the DAO Token holder certain voting and ownership rights. According to promotional materials, The DAO would earn profits by funding projects that would provide DAO Token holders a return on investment. The various promotional materials disseminated by Slock.it’s co-founders touted that DAO Token holders would receive “rewards,” which the White Paper defined as, “any [ETH] received by a DAO [Entity] generated from projects the DAO [Entity] funded.” DAO Token holders would then vote to either use the rewards to fund new projects or to distribute the ETH to DAO Token holders.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>From April 30, 2016 through May 28, 2016 (the “Offering Period”), The DAO offered and sold DAO Tokens. Investments in The DAO were made “pseudonymously” (i.e., an individual’s or entity’s pseudonym was their Ethereum Blockchain address). To purchase a DAO Token offered for sale by The DAO, an individual or entity sent ETH from their Ethereum Blockchain address to an Ethereum Blockchain address associated with The DAO. All of the ETH raised in the offering as well as any future profits earned by The DAO were to be pooled and held in The DAO’s Ethereum Blockchain address. The token price fluctuated in a range of approximately 1 to 1.5 ETH per 100 DAO Tokens, depending on when the tokens were purchased during the Offering Period.  Anyone was eligible to purchase DAO Tokens (as long as they paid ETH). There ere no limitations placed on the number of DAO Tokens offered for sale, the number of purchasers of DAO Tokens, or the level of sophistication of such purchasers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>DAO Token holders were not restricted from re-selling DAO Tokens acquired in the offering, and DAO Token holders could sell their DAO Tokens in a variety of ways in the secondary market and thereby monetize their investment as discussed below. Prior to the Offering Period, Slock.it solicited at least one U.S. web-based platform to trade DAO Tokens on
its system and, at the time of the offering, The DAO Website and other promotional materials disseminated by Slock.it included representations that DAO Tokens would be available for secondary market trading after the Offering Period via several platforms. During the Offering Period and afterwards, the Platforms posted notices on their own websites and on social media that each planned to support secondary market trading of DAO Tokens.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_20"><sup><strong>(20)</strong></sup></a>
In addition to secondary market trading on the Platforms, after the Offering Period, DAO
Tokens were to be freely transferable on the Ethereum Blockchain. DAO Token holders would
also be permitted to redeem their DAO Tokens for ETH through a complicated, multi-week
(approximately 46-day) process referred to as a DAO Entity “split.”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_21"><sup><strong>(21)</strong></sup></a></p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>According to the White Paper, in order for a project to be considered for funding with “a DAO [Entity]’s [ETH],” a “Contractor” first must submit a proposal to the DAO Entity. Specifically, DAO Token holders expected Contractors to submit proposals for projects that could provide DAO Token holders returns on their investments. Submitting a proposal to The DAO involved: (1) writing a smart contract, and then deploying and publishing it on the Ethereum Blockchain; and (2) posting details about the proposal on The DAO Website, including the Ethereum Blockchain address of the deployed contract and a link to its source code. Proposals could be viewed on The DAO Website as well as other publicly-accessible websites. Per the White Paper, there were two prerequisites for submitting a proposal. An individual or entity must: (1) own at least one DAO Token; and (2) pay a deposit in the form of ETH that would be forfeited to the DAO Entity if the proposal was put up for a vote and failed to achieve a quorum of DAO Token holders. It was publicized that Slock.it would be the first to submit a proposal for funding.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_22"><sup><strong>(22)</strong></sup></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>ETH raised by The DAO was to be distributed to a Contractor to fund a proposal only on a majority vote of DAO Token holders.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_23"><sup><strong>(23)</strong></sup></a> DAO Token holders were to cast votes, which would be weighted by the number of tokens they controlled, for or against the funding of a specific proposal. The voting process, however, was publicly criticized in that it could incentivize distorted voting behavior and, as a result, would not accurately reflect the consensus of the majority of DAO Token holders. Specifically, as noted in a May 27, 2016 blog post by a group of computer security researchers, The DAO’s structure included a “strong positive bias to vote YES on proposals and to suppress NO votes as a side effect of the way in which it restricts users’ range of options following the casting of a vote.”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_24"><sup><strong>(24)</strong></sup></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Before any proposal was put to a vote by DAO Token holders, it was required to be reviewed by one or more of The DAO’s “Curators.” At the time of the formation of The DAO, the Curators were a group of individuals chosen by Slock.it.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_25"><sup><strong>(25)</strong></sup></a> According to the White Paper, the Curators of a DAO Entity had “considerable power.” The Curators performed crucial security functions and maintained ultimate control over which proposals could be submitted to, voted on, and funded by The DAO. As stated on The DAO Website during the Offering Period, The DAO relied on its Curators for “failsafe protection” and for protecting The DAO from “malicous [sic] actors.” Specifically, per The DAO Website, a Curator was responsible for: (1) confirming that any proposal for funding originated from an identifiable person or organization; and (2) confirming that smart contracts associated with any such proposal properly reflected the code the Contractor claims to have deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain. If a Curator determined that the proposal met these criteria, the Curator could add the proposal to the “whitelist,” which was a list of Ethereum Blockchain addresses that could receive ETH from The DAO if the majority of DAO Token holders voted for the proposal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Curators of The DAO had ultimate discretion as to whether or not to submit a proposal for voting by DAO Token holders. Curators also determined the order and frequency of proposals, and could impose subjective criteria for whether the proposal should be whitelisted. One member of the group chosen by Slock.it to serve collectively as the Curator stated publicly that the Curator had “complete control over the whitelist … the order in which things get whitelisted, the duration for which [proposals] get whitelisted, when things get unwhitelisted … [and] clear ability to control the order and frequency of proposals,” noting that “curators have tremendous power.”<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_26"><sup><strong>(26)</strong></sup></a> Another Curator publicly announced his subjective criteria for determining whether to whitelist a proposal, which included his personal ethics.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_27"><sup><strong>(27)</strong></sup></a> Per the White Paper, a Curator also had the power to reduce the voting quorum requirement by 50% every other week. Absent action by a Curator, the quorum could be reduced by 50% only if no proposal had reached the required quorum for 52 weeks.</p>

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>During the period from May 28, 2016 through early September 2016, the Platforms became the preferred vehicle for DAO Token holders to buy and sell DAO Tokens in the secondary market using virtual or fiat currencies. Specifically, the Platforms used electronic systems that allowed their respective customers to post orders for DAO Tokens on an anonymous basis. For example, customers of each Platform could buy or sell DAO Tokens by entering a market order on the Platform’s system, which would then match with orders from other customers residing on the system. Each Platform’s system would automatically execute these orders based on pre-programmed order interaction protocols established by the Platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>None of the Platforms received orders for DAO Tokens from non-Platform customers or routed its respective customers’ orders to any other trading destinations. The Platforms publicly displayed all their quotes, trades, and daily trading volume in DAO Tokens on their respective websites. During the period from May 28, 2016 through September 6, 2016, one such Platform executed more than 557,378 buy and sell transactions in DAO Tokens by more than 15,000 of its U.S. and foreign customers. During the period from May 28, 2016 through August 1, 2016, another such Platform executed more than 22,207 buy and sell transactions in DAO Tokens by more than 700 of its U.S. customers.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In late May 2016, just prior to the expiration of the Offering Period, concerns about the safety and security of The DAO’s funds began to surface due to vulnerabilities in The DAO’s code. On May 26, 2016, in response to these concerns, Slock.it submitted a “DAO Security Proposal” that called for the development of certain updates to The DAO’s code and the appointment of a security expert.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_28"><sup><strong>(28)</strong></sup></a> Further, on June 3, 2016, Christoph Jentzsch, on behalf of Slock.it, proposed a moratorium on all proposals until alterations to The DAO’s code to fix vulnerabilities in The DAO’s code had been implemented.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_29"><sup><strong>(29)</strong></sup></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>On June 17, 2016, an unknown individual or group (the “Attacker”) began rapidly diverting ETH from The DAO, causing approximately 3.6 million ETH—1/3 of the total ETH raised by The DAO offering—to move from The DAO’s Ethereum Blockchain address to an Ethereum Blockchain address controlled by the Attacker (the “Attack”).<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_30"><sup><strong>(30)</strong></sup></a> Although the diverted ETH was then held in an address controlled by the Attacker, the Attacker was prevented by The DAO’s code from moving the ETH from that address for 27 days.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_31"><sup><strong>(31)</strong></sup></a>31</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In order to secure the diverted ETH and return it to DAO Token holders, Slock.it’s cofounders and others endorsed a “Hard Fork” to the Ethereum Blockchain. The “Hard Fork,” called for a change in the Ethereum protocol on a going forward basis that would restore the DAO Token holders’ investments as if the Attack had not occurred. On July 20, 2016, after a majority of the Ethereum network adopted the necessary software updates, the new, forked Ethereum Blockchain became active.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_32"><sup><strong>(32)</strong></sup></a> The Hard Fork had the effect of transferring all of the funds raised (including those held by the Attacker) from The DAO to a recovery address, where DAO Token holders could exchange their DAO Tokens for ETH.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_33"><sup><strong>(33)</strong></sup></a> All DAO Token holders who adopted the Hard Fork could exchange their DAO Tokens for ETH, and avoid any loss of the ETH they had invested.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_34"><sup><strong>(34)</strong></sup></a></p>

<p>The Commission is aware that virtual organizations and associated individuals and entities increasingly are using distributed ledger technology to offer and sell instruments such as DAO Tokens to raise capital. These offers and sales have been referred to, among other things, as “Initial Coin Offerings” or “Token Sales.” Accordingly, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to issue this Report in order to stress that the U.S. federal securities law may apply to various activities, including distributed ledger technology, depending on the particular facts and circumstances, without regard to the form of the organization or technology used to effectuate a particular offer or sale.

<p>Under Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act, a security includes “an investment contract.” See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77b-77c. An investment contract is an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. See SEC v. Edwards, 540 U.S. 389, 393 (2004); SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 301 (1946); see also United Housing Found., Inc. v. Forman, 421 U.S. 837, 852-53 (1975) (The “touchstone” of an investment contract “is the presence of an investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.”). This definition embodies a “flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.” Howey, 328 U.S. at 299 (emphasis added). The test “permits the fulfillment of the statutory purpose of compelling full and fair disclosure relative to the issuance of ‘the many types of instruments that in our commercial world fall within the ordinary concept of a security.’” Id. In analyzing whether something is a security, “form should be disregarded for substance,” Tcherepnin v.

The projects (or “contracts”) would be proposed by Contractors. If the proposed contracts were whitelisted by Curators, DAO Token holders could vote on whether The DAO should fund the proposed contracts. Depending on the terms of each particular contract, DAO Token holders stood to share in potential profits from the contracts.

</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Investors’ profits were to be derived from the managerial efforts of others—specifically, Slock.it and its co-founders, and The DAO’s Curators. The central issue is “whether the efforts made by those other than the investor are the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise.” SEC v. Glenn W. Turner Enters., Inc., 474 F.2d 476, 482 (9th Cir. 1973). The DAO’s investors relied on the managerial and entrepreneurial efforts of Slock.it and its co-founders, and The DAO’s Curators, to manage The DAO and put forth project proposals that could generate profits for The DAO’s investors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Investors’ expectations were primed by the marketing of The DAO and active engagement between Slock.it and its co-founders with The DAO and DAO Token holders. To market The DAO and DAO Tokens, Slock.it created The DAO Website on which it published the White Paper explaining how a DAO Entity would work and describing their vision for a DAO Entity. Slock.it also created and maintained other online forums that it used to provide information to DAO Token holders about how to vote and perform other tasks related to their investment. Slock.it appears to have closely monitored these forums, answering questions from DAO Token holders about a variety of topics, including the future of The DAO, security concerns, ground rules for how The DAO would work, and the anticipated role of DAO Token holders. The creators of The DAO held themselves out to investors as experts in Ethereum, the blockchain protocol on which The DAO operated, and told investors that they had selected persons to serve as Curators based on their expertise and credentials. Additionally, Slock.it told investors that it expected to put forth the first substantive profit-making contract proposal—a blockchain venture in its area of expertise. Through their conduct and marketing materials, Slock.it and its co-founders led investors to believe that they could be relied on to provide the significant managerial efforts required to make The DAO a success.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Investors in The DAO reasonably expected Slock.it and its co-founders, and The DAO’s Curators, to provide significant managerial efforts after The DAO’s launch. The expertise of The DAO’s creators and Curators was critical in monitoring the operation of The DAO, safeguarding investor funds, and determining whether proposed contracts should be put for a vote. Investors had little choice but to rely on their expertise. At the time of the offering, The DAO’s protocols had already been pre-determined by Slock.it and its co-founders, including the control that could be exercised by the Curators. Slock.it and its co-founders chose the Curators, whose function it was to: (1) vet Contractors; (2) determine whether and when to submit proposals for votes; (3) determine the order and frequency of proposals that were submitted for a vote; and (4) determine whether to halve the default quorum necessary for a successful vote on certain proposals. Thus, the Curators exercised significant control over the order and frequency of proposals, and could impose their own subjective criteria for whether the proposal should be whitelisted for a vote by DAO Token holders. DAO Token holders’ votes were limited to proposals whitelisted by the Curators, and, although any DAO Token holder could put forth a proposal, each proposal would follow the same protocol, which included vetting and control by the current Curators. While DAO Token holders could put forth proposals to replace a Curator, such proposals were subject to control by the current Curators, including whitelisting and approval of the new address to which the tokens would be directed for such a proposal. In essence, Curators had the power to determine whether a proposal to remove a Curator was put to a vote. <a href="#ico_dao_footnote_36"><sup><strong>(36)</strong></sup></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>And, Slock.it and its co-founders did, in fact, actively oversee The DAO. They monitored The DAO closely and addressed issues as they arose, proposing a moratorium on all proposals until vulnerabilities in The DAO’s code had been addressed and a security expert to monitor potential attacks on The DAO had been appointed. When the Attacker exploited a weakness in the code and removed investor funds, Slock.it and its co-founders stepped in to help resolve the situation.</p>

<li>
<p>DAO Token Holders’ Voting Rights Were Limited</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Although DAO Token holders were afforded voting rights, these voting rights were limited. DAO Token holders were substantially reliant on the managerial efforts of Slock.it, its co-founders, and the Curators. <a href="#ico_dao_footnote_37"><sup><strong>(37)</strong></sup></a> Even if an investor’s efforts help to make an enterprise profitable, those efforts do not necessarily equate with a promoter’s significant managerial efforts or control over the enterprise. See, e.g., Glenn W. Turner, 474 F.2d at 482 (finding that a multi-level marketing scheme was an investment contract and that investors relied on the promoter’s managerial efforts, despite the fact that investors put forth the majority of the labor that made the enterprise profitable, because the promoter dictated the terms and controlled the scheme itself); Long v. Shultz, 881 F.2d 129, 137 (5th Cir. 1989) (“An investor may authorize the assumption of particular risks that would create the possibility of greater profits or losses but still depend on a third party for all of the essential managerial efforts without which the risk could not pay off.”). See also generally SEC v. Merchant Capital, LLC, 483 F.3d 747 (11th Cir. 2007) (finding an investment contract even where voting rights were provided to purported general partners, noting that the voting process provided limited information for investors to make informed decisions, and the purported general partners lacked control over the information in the ballots).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The voting rights afforded DAO Token holders did not provide them with meaningful control over the enterprise, because (1) DAO Token holders’ ability to vote for contracts was a largely perfunctory one; and (2) DAO Token holders were widely dispersed and limited in their ability to communicate with one another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>First, as discussed above, DAO Token holders could only vote on proposals that had been cleared by the Curators.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_38"><sup><strong>(38)</strong></sup></a> And that clearance process did not include any mechanism to provide DAO Token holders with sufficient information to permit them to make informed voting decisions. Indeed, based on the particular facts concerning The DAO and the few draft proposals discussed in online forums, there are indications that contract proposals would not have necessarily provide enough information for investors to make an informed voting decision, affording them less meaningful control. For example, the sample contract proposal attached to the White Paper included little information concerning the terms of the contract. Also, the Slock.it co-founders put forth a draft of their own contract proposal and, in response to questions and requests to negotiate the terms of the proposal (posted to a DAO forum), a Slock.it founder explained that the proposal was intentionally vague and that it was, in essence, a take it or leave it proposition not subject to negotiation or feedback. See, e.g., SEC v. Shields, 744 F.3d 633, 643-45 (10th Cir. 2014) (in assessing whether agreements were investment contracts, court looked to whether “the investors actually had the type of control reserved under the agreements to obtain access to information necessary to protect, manage, and control their investments at the time they purchased their interests.”).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Second, the pseudonymity and dispersion of the DAO Token holders made it difficult for them to join together to effect change or to exercise meaningful control. Investments in The DAO were made pseudonymously (such that the real-world identities of investors are not apparent), and there was great dispersion among those individuals and/or entities who were invested in The DAO and thousands of individuals and/or entities that traded DAO Tokens in the secondary market—an arrangement that bears little resemblance to that of a genuine general partnership. Cf. Williamson v. Tucker, 645 F.2d 404, 422-24 (5th Cir. 1981) (“[O]ne would not expect partnership interests sold to large numbers of the general public to provide any real partnership control; at some point there would be so many [limited] partners that a partnership vote would be more like a corporate vote, each partner’s role having been diluted to the level of a single shareholder in a corporation.”).<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_39"><sup><strong>(39)</strong></sup></a> Slock.it did create and maintain online forums on which investors could submit posts regarding contract proposals, which were not limited to use by DAO Token holders (anyone was permitted to post). However, DAO Token holders were pseudonymous, as were their posts to the forums. Those facts, combined with the sheer number of DAO Token holders, potentially made the forums of limited use if investors hoped to consolidate their votes into blocs powerful enough to assert actual control. This was later demonstrated through the fact that DAO Token holders were unable to effectively address the Attack without the assistance of Slock.it and others. The DAO Token holders’ pseudonymity and dispersion diluted their control over The DAO. See Merchant Capital, 483 F.3d at 758 (finding geographic dispersion of investors weighing against investor control).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>These facts diminished the ability of DAO Token holders to exercise meaningful control over the enterprise through the voting process, rendering the voting rights of DAO Token holders akin to those of a corporate shareholder. Steinhardt Group, Inc. v. Citicorp., 126 F.3d 144, 152 (3d Cir. 1997) (“It must be emphasized that the assignment of nominal or limited responsibilities to the participant does not negate the existence of an investment contract; where the duties
assigned are so narrowly circumscribed as to involve little real choice of action … a security may be found to exist … . [The] emphasis must be placed on economic reality.”) (citing SEC v. Koscot Interplanetary, Inc., 497 F.2d 473, 483 n. 14 (5th Cir. 1974)).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>By contract and in reality, DAO Token holders relied on the significant managerial efforts provided by Slock.it and its co-founders, and The DAO’s Curators, as described above. Their efforts, not those of DAO Token holders, were the “undeniably significant” ones, essential to the overall success and profitability of any investment into The DAO. See Glenn W. Turner, 474 F.2d at 482.</p>

During the Offering Period, The DAO offered and sold DAO Tokens in exchange for ETH through The DAO Website, which was publicly-accessible, including to individuals in the United States. During the Offering Period, The DAO sold approximately 1.15 billion DAO Tokens in exchange for a total of approximately 12 million ETH, which was valued in USD, at the time, at approximately $150 million. Because DAO Tokens were securities, The DAO was required to register the offer and sale of DAO Tokens, unless a valid exemption from such registration applied.</p>

<p>Section 5 of the Exchange Act makes it unlawful for any broker, dealer, or exchange, directly or indirectly, to effect any transaction in a security, or to report any such transaction, in interstate commerce, unless the exchange is registered as a national securities exchange under Section 6 of the Exchange Act, or is exempted from such registration. See 15 U.S.C. §78e. Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act defines an “exchange” as “any organization, association, or group of persons, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which constitutes, maintains, or provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood … .” 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(1). Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) provides a functional test to assess whether a trading system meets the definition of exchange under Section 3(a)(1). Under Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a), an organization, association, or group of persons shall be considered to constitute, maintain, or provide “a marketplace or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange,” if such organization, association, or group of persons: (1) brings together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers; and (2) uses established, non-discretionary methods (whether by providing a trading facility or by setting rules) under which such orders interact with each other, and the buyers and sellers entering such orders agree to the terms of the trade.<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_40"><sup><strong>(40)</strong></sup></a>
A system that meets the criteria of Rule 3b-16(a), and is not excluded under Rule 3b16(b), must register as a national securities exchange pursuant to Sections 5 and 6 of the Exchange Act <a href="#ico_dao_footnote_41"><sup><strong>(41)</strong></sup></a> or operate pursuant to an appropriate exemption. One frequently used exemption is for alternative trading systems (“ATS”).<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_42"><sup><strong>(42)</strong></sup></a> Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) exempts from the definition of “exchange” under Section 3(a)(1) an ATS that complies with Regulation ATS,<a href="#ico_dao_footnote_43"><sup><strong>(43)</strong></sup></a> which includes, among other things, the requirement to register as a broker-dealer and file a Form ATS with the Commission to provide notice of the ATS’s operations. Therefore, an ATS that operates pursuant to the Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) exemption and complies with Regulation ATS would not be subject to the registration requirement of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.</p>

<p>The Platforms that traded DAO Tokens appear to have satisfied the criteria of Rule 3b16(a) and do not appear to have been excluded from Rule 3b-16(b).

</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Whether or not a particular transaction involves the offer and sale of a security— regardless of the terminology used—will depend on the facts and circumstances, including the economic realities of the transaction. Those who offer and sell securities in the United States must comply with the federal securities laws, including the requirement to register with the Commission or to qualify for an exemption from the registration requirements of the federal
securities laws. The registration requirements are designed to provide investors with procedural protections and material information necessary to make informed investment decisions. These requirements apply to those who offer and sell securities in the United States, regardless whether the issuing entity is a traditional company or a decentralized autonomous organization, regardless whether those securities are purchased using U.S. dollars or virtual currencies, and regardless whether they are distributed in certificated form or through distributed ledger technology. In addition, any entity or person engaging in the activities of an exchange, such as bringing together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers using established nondiscretionary methods under which such orders interact with each other and buyers and sellers entering such orders agree upon the terms of the trade, must register as a national securities exchange or operate pursuant to an exemption from such registration.</p>

It is not issued or guaranteed by any jurisdiction, and fulfils the above functions only by agreement within the community of users of the virtual currency. Virtual currency is distinguished from fiat currency (a.k.a. “real currency,” “real money,” or “national currency”), which is the coin and paper money of a country that is designated as its legal tender; circulates; and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the issuing country. It is distinct from e-money, which is a digital representation of fiat currency used to electronically transfer value denominated in fiat currency.</span></p>

There will be many use cases, and the DAO [Entity] code will develop over time. Ultimately, how a DAO [Entity] functions and its legal status will depend on many factors, including how DAO [Entity] code is used, where it is used, and who uses it.

Although The DAO has been described as a “crowdfunding contract,” The DAO would not have met the requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding, adopted under Title III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act of 2012 (providing an exemption from registration for certain crowdfunding), because, among other things, it was not a broker-dealer or a funding portal registered with the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”).

using an application that interfaces with the Ethereum Blockchain. It was generally acknowledged that DAO Token

Jentzsch, supra note 8 at 8 (“The tokens used to vote will be blocked, meaning they can not [sic] be transferred until
the proposal is closed.”). If, however, a DAO Token holder abstained from voting, the DAO Token holder could
avoid these restrictions; any DAO Tokens not submitted for a vote could be withdrawn or transferred at any time.
As a result, DAO Token holders were incentivized either to vote yes or to abstain from voting. See Dino Mark et al.,

vectors The DAO may face, including social, technical and economic attacks.” Id. Slock.it initially proposed a
much broader security proposal that included the formation of a “DAO Security” group, the establishment of a “Bug
Bounty Program,” and routine external audits of The DAO’s code. However, the cost of the proposal (125,000

<p><span class="underline">Summary</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>As described more fully below, EtherDelta is an online platform that allows buyers and sellers to trade certain digital assets – Ether and “ERC20 tokens” – in secondary market trading. ERC20 tokens refer to digital assets issued and distributed on the Ethereum Blockchain using the ERC20 protocol, which is the standard coding protocol currently used by a significant majority of issuers in Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”).<a href="#coburn_footnote_2"><strong><sup><em>(2)</em></sup></strong></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EtherDelta’s website, launched by Coburn on July 12, 2016, provides a user-friendly interface to EtherDelta and resembles online securities trading platforms. For example, the website makes token “pairs”<a href="#coburn_footnote_3"><strong><sup><em>(3)</em></sup></strong></a> available for trading, provides access to the EtherDelta order book, and displays the current, top 500 firm bids and offers by symbol, price, and size. The website also displays account information for users of the EtherDelta platform (“Users”) (tracked by the User’s Ethereum address and maintained in an internal ledger) and provides fields for Users to input trading interest in any token pair. Users may enter orders to buy or sell specified quantities of any ERC20 token at a specified price (in Ether) and with a specified time-in-force. The website also displays to Users market depth<a href="#coburn_footnote_4"><strong><sup><em>(4)</em></sup></strong></a> charts and a list of confirmed trades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On July 25, 2017, the Commission issued its Report of Investigation Pursuant To Section 21(a) Of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO (Exchange Act Rel. No. 81207) (July 25, 2017) (the “DAO Report”). In the DAO Report, the Commission advised that a platform that offers trading of digital assets that are securities and operates as an “exchange,” as defined by the federal securities laws, must register with the Commission as a national securities exchange or be exempt from registration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From July 12, 2016 to December 15, 2017 (the “Relevant Period”), more than 3.6 million buy and sell orders in ERC20 tokens that included securities as defined by Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act were traded on EtherDelta, of which approximately 92% (3.3 million) were traded during the period following the DAO Report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As discussed further below, EtherDelta meets the criteria of an “exchange” as defined by Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 3b-16 thereunder. During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta was not registered with the Commission as a national securities exchange and it did not operate pursuant to any exemption from registration. As a result, and as discussed further below, Coburn should have known that his actions would contribute to EtherDelta’s violations and thus, under Exchange Act Section 21C(a), caused EtherDelta to violate Section 5 of the Exchange Act.</p>

<li>
<p>Coburn, age 31, is a resident of Chicago, Illinois. From September 2010 to June 2015, Coburn was a registered representative with a Chicago-based options trading firm that was a broker-dealer registered with the Commission. In approximately June 2015, Coburn left that firm to pursue his own business interests. In March 2016, he created EtherOpt, an online platform for trading options and, in July 2016, he created EtherDelta.<a href="#coburn_footnote_5"><strong><sup><em>(5)</em></sup></strong></a> In November 2017, Coburn entered into an agreement to sell EtherDelta to foreign buyers and, as of December 16, 2017, Coburn ceased to collect any fees from Users of the platform. Coburn does not currently operate EtherDelta.</p>

<span class="underline">The EtherDelta Website and Hours of Operations</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="7">
<li>
<p>As seen below, the EtherDelta website had features similar to online securities trading platforms. For each Ether/ERC20 token pair available for trading on EtherDelta, the website provided access to the EtherDelta order book and displayed the top 500 orders to buy and orders to sell, sorted by price and color (buy orders are green and sell orders are red). The website provided User account information and provided fields for Users to input deposit, withdrawal, and trading interest. The website also provided Users’ daily transaction volumes per token, market depth charts, and a list of User’s confirmed trades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the Relevant Period, the EtherDelta platform was available to anyone, including U.S. persons, and had no specified hours of operation. As long as EtherDelta’s website was operational, Users could interact directly with the EtherDelta smart contract or enter orders and trade tokens through the website 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>

<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline">The EtherDelta Smart Contract</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="9">
<li>
<p>EtherDelta’s business operations are defined and executed by EtherDelta’s “smart contract”<a href="#coburn_footnote_6"><strong><sup><em>(6)</em></sup></strong></a> that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain. The EtherDelta smart contract consists of coded functions<a href="#coburn_footnote_7"><strong><sup><em>(7)</em></sup></strong></a> that allow for, among other things, the trading of any Ether/ ERC20 token pair.<a href="#coburn_footnote_8"><strong><sup><em>(8)</em></sup></strong></a> On July 8, 2016, Coburn deployed the code for the first EtherDelta smart contract, written in the programming language Solidity, onto the Ethereum Blockchain. When it was deployed, the EtherDelta smart contract created an Ethereum Blockchain address, where the smart contract “resides.”<a href="#coburn_footnote_9"><strong><sup><em>(9)</em></sup></strong></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the EtherDelta smart contract runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, every interaction with EtherDelta by a User requires the User to send a message to the Ethereum Blockchain mining network to be executed on the EtherDelta smart contract.<a href="#coburn_footnote_10"><strong><sup><em>(10)</em></sup></strong></a> When Ethereum Blockchain miners run the EtherDelta smart contract, the smart contract applies a preexisting set of rules (i.e., its code) to given inputs. If the User’s message results in a change of state to the Ethereum Blockchain, such as through a User request to move or withdraw ERC20 tokens to and from the EtherDelta smart contract, or through a User request to trade on the EtherDelta platform, among other things, the Ethereum Blockchain miners then record that change of state, i.e., reflecting the transfer of Ether and/or ERC20 tokens to and from addresses, to the Ethereum Blockchain. If the User’s message does not result in a change of state, such as through a User request to check the balance of the User’s Ethereum address on EtherDelta, there is no change of state recorded to the Ethereum Blockchain.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline">EtherDelta User Eligibility</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="11">
<li>
<p>As a prerequisite for submitting an order to the platform, a User must first have an Ethereum wallet address that is capable of sending messages to the Ethereum Blockchain. Users may create a new wallet address through EtherDelta’s website or by using other wallet software that is compatible with EtherDelta. Users trade on EtherDelta pseudonymously by using one or more Ethereum addresses, each a unique string of numbers and letters. Users must also demonstrate that they have available ERC20 tokens or Ether to trade on EtherDelta.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline">Tokens Eligible for Trading and EtherDelta’s “Official Listings”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="12">
<li>
<p>Users may enter orders to buy or sell any token that is ERC20 compliant. Coburn purposely wrote the EtherDelta smart contract to include the ERC20 token coding standard and there are no rules set forth in the smart contract that limit a User from trading any particular ERC20 token on EtherDelta.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta maintained a list of “official [token] listings, a select list of ERC20 Tokens that were available for trading on EtherDelta.” Prior to identifying a token as an official listing, Coburn requested certain information from a token issuer (e.g., the token’s name, associated website URL, and a paragraph describing the token) and performed his own due diligence on these tokens. Official listings appeared on a drop down menu on a sidebar on EtherDelta’s website for easy User accessibility. During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta had approximately 500 official token listings.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline">The EtherDelta Order Book</span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="14">
<li>
<p>With respect to a given order, an EtherDelta User is identified as either a “maker” or “taker” on the EtherDelta platform. A maker is someone that posts an order to buy or sell a particular ERC20 token on the EtherDelta website, which signals to other Users their intention to trade a particular token at a specific price, size, and time. A taker is someone seeking to become the counterparty to a maker’s order on the platform.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Order Types and Order Entry</em></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="15">
<li>
<p>The only order type available on EtherDelta is a limit order to buy or sell a token at a specific price. There are no market orders.<a href="#coburn_footnote_11"><strong><sup><em>(11)</em></sup></strong></a>  Users indicate their interest to buy or sell a token by entering a buy or sell order. At the time an order is entered, Users provide the following information onto the EtherDelta’s website: token symbol, size, price and time-in-force (measured in “blocks”).<a href="#coburn_footnote_12"><strong><sup><em>(12)</em></sup></strong></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike other operations on EtherDelta, entering an order on EtherDelta does not change the state of the Ethereum Blockchain and, as a result, there is no gas fee (paid in Ether to the Ethereum miners) associated with entering an order on EtherDelta. Rather, all orders are stored in EtherDelta’s order book, which resides on a centralized server maintained by EtherDelta and not on the Ethereum Blockchain.<a href="#coburn_footnote_13"><strong><sup><em>(13)</em></sup></strong></a>  As discussed above, for each token pair, EtherDelta’s website displays only the top 500 buy and sell orders, sorted by price and order type (buy or sell).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Order Execution and the Order Book</em></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="17">
<li>
<p>All orders on EtherDelta must be acted upon by a taker for a trade to occur. When a taker seeks to trade with a maker’s order, the taker, through the EtherDelta website interface, clicks on an order displayed on EtherDelta’s order book and enters the size of the order. This pairs the maker’s cryptographically-signed intent to trade (i.e., the maker order) with the taker’s cryptographically-signed intent to trade (i.e., the taker’s order) and instructs the Ethereum Blockchain miners to run the EtherDelta smart contract, which automatically performs certain checks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No further confirmation or action is required by the taker for the taker’s message to be executed by the smart contract and for a trade to occur. The smart contract checks that the messages are valid (contain valid cryptographic signatures), confirms the conditions of the orders (i.e., orders have not expired or been canceled) and that both Users have sufficient funds and/or tokens to complete the trade. If the messages are valid and there are sufficient funds and/or tokens, the trade is executed and the smart contract will update the smart contract’s internal ledger to reflect the trade. The maker order will remain displayed on EtherDelta’s website until the miners write the trade and post it to the Ethereum Blockchain. Thereafter, information displayed on the EtherDelta order book and website is updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a taker clicks on a maker’s order, this action will automatically result in a trade unless: (1) there are insufficient funds and/or tokens to complete the trade or pay the gas fee; (2) a competing taker’s order is confirmed on the Blockchain first; (3) the maker’s order has expired; or (4) the maker or taker’s order has been cancelled.<a href="#coburn_footnote_14"><strong><sup><em>(14)</em></sup></strong></a></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In posts on Reddit, Coburn explained that: “[a]t a high level, EtherDelta functions just like a normal exchange” and “[l]ike any other exchange, EtherDelta has an order book of resting orders.”<a href="#coburn_footnote_16"><strong><sup><em>(16)</em></sup></strong></a> However, unlike a traditional exchange, “[t]here is no ‘exchange owner’ holding your funds.

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>A. EtherDelta Violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="23">
<li>
<p>Section 5 of the Exchange Act makes it unlawful for any broker, dealer, or exchange, directly or indirectly, to effect any transaction in a security, or to report any such transaction, in interstate commerce, unless the exchange is registered as a national securities exchange under Section 6 of the Exchange Act, or is exempted from such registration. Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act defines an “exchange” as “any organization, association, or group of persons, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which constitutes, maintains, or provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood, and includes the market place and the market facilities maintained by such exchange.” 15 USC § 78c(a)(1).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) provides a functional test to assess whether a trading system meets the definition of exchange under Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) provides that an organization, association, or group of persons shall be considered to constitute, maintain, or provide “a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by an exchange” as those terms are used in Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act if such an organization, association, or group of persons: (1) brings together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers; and (2) uses established, non-discretionary methods (whether by providing a trading facility or by setting rules) under which such orders interact with each other, and the buyers and sellers entering such orders agree to the terms of the trade.<a href="#coburn_footnote_18"><strong><sup><em>(18)</em></sup></strong></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A system that meets the criteria of Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a), and is not excluded under Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(b), must register, pursuant to Section 5 of the Exchange Act, as a national securities exchange under Section 6 of the Exchange Act<a href="#coburn_footnote_19"><strong><sup><em>(19)</em></sup></strong></a> or operate pursuant to an appropriate exemption. One of the available exemptions is for alternative trading systems (“ATSs”).<a href="#coburn_footnote_20"><strong><sup><em>(20)</em></sup></strong></a> Exchange Act Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) exempts from the definition of “exchange” under Section 3(a)(1) an organization, association, or group of persons that complies with Regulation ATS.<a href="#coburn_footnote_21"><strong><sup><em>(21)</em></sup></strong></a> Regulation ATS requires an ATS to, among other things, register as a broker-dealer, file a Form ATS with the Commission to notice its operations, and establish written safeguards and procedures to protect subscribers’ confidential trading information. An ATS that complies with Regulation ATS and operates pursuant to the Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) exemption would not be required by Section 5 to register as a national securities exchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EtherDelta satisfied the criteria of Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) and is not excluded under Rule 3b-16(b). During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta operated as a market place for bringing together the orders of multiple buyers and sellers in tokens that included securities as defined by Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act. The purchasers of such digital tokens invested money with a reasonable expectation of profits, including through the increased value of their investments in secondary trading, based on the managerial efforts of others. See DAO Report; SEC v. Edwards, 540 U.S. 389, 393 (2004); SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 301 (1946). As discussed above, EtherDelta brought together orders by receiving and storing orders in tokens in the EtherDelta order book and displaying the top 500 orders (including token symbol, size, and price) as bids and offers on the EtherDelta website. EtherDelta provided the means for these orders to interact and execute through the combined use of the EtherDelta website, order book, and pre-programmed trading protocols defined in the EtherDelta smart contract. These established non-discretionary methods allowed Users to agree upon the terms of their trades in tokens on EtherDelta during the Relevant Period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite operating as a Rule 3b-16(a) system, EtherDelta did not register as a national securities exchange or operate pursuant to an exemption from such registration. Accordingly, EtherDelta violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act.</p>

<p>[2] An ICO is a term that describes the offer and sale of digital assets issued and distributed on a blockchain. A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, or peer-to-peer database spread across a network, that records all transactions in the network in theoretically unchangeable, digitally-recorded data packages called blocks. Each block contains a batch of records of transactions, including a timestamp and a reference to the previous block, linking the blocks together in a chain. The system relies on cryptographic techniques for secure recording of transactions. A blockchain can be shared and accessed by anyone with appropriate permissions. The Ethereum Blockchain is an open, or permissionless, blockchain that is a record of events resulting from the execution of code (smart contracts) on the Ethereum Blockchain. ERC20 refers to a specific Ethereum token issuing protocol, formally adopted by the Ethereum network in September 2017, and used on the Ethereum Blockchain. (ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comments and 20 is the unique identification used to distinguish this coding standard from other standards.) The ERC20 token standard, created in November 2015, “allows any token on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges” and “provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.” See Fabian Vogelsteller and Vitalik Buterin, ERC-20 Token Standard, November 19, 2015, <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md" class="bare">https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md</a>. The widespread adoption of the ERC20 token standard has also led developers to design applications, such as EtherDelta, that are compatible with any ERC20 token.</p>
</div>
<div id="coburn_footnote_3" class="paragraph">
<p>[3] Token pair refers to a trade between one digital asset and either another digital asset or fiat currency. On EtherDelta, the only token pairs available for trading were those between a particular ERC20 token and Ether.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="quoteblock">a computerized transaction protocol that executes terms of a contract. The general objectives of smart contract design are to satisfy common contractual conditions (such as payment terms, liens, confidentiality, and even enforcement), minimize exceptions both malicious and accidental, and minimize the need for trusted intermediaries.

<p>[10] Anyone can interact with the Ethereum Blockchain by transmitting a cryptographically-secured message to the Blockchain. That message can be “state-changing” in that it can request that a particular smart contract on the Ethereum Blockchain perform a certain function that results in a change of state of the Blockchain. A state-changing message is also referred to as a “Send.” Alternatively, a message can simply request information already written to the Blockchain, and not result in a change to the state of the Blockchain. That type of message is referred to as a “Call.” Any Send must first be validated and the resulting change of state recorded to the Blockchain by the “mining” activities of a network of Ethereum “miners,” which are computing nodes on the Blockchain. A Send generally requires the payment of “gas,” or a fee paid in Ether to the Ethereum miners. Generally (but not always), the speed at which a transaction is mined on the Ethereum Blockchain is determined by the amount of gas paid by the sender of a transaction to the mining network; the higher the gas price paid for the transaction, the faster a transaction is likely to be mined. The gas price is set by the sender at the time the message is sent to the network.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit: Crypto</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thank you Andy. I am pleased to be here today. This event provides a great opportunity to address a topic that is the subject of considerable debate in the press and in the crypto-community&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;whether a digital asset offered as a security can, over time, become something other than a security.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To start, we should frame the question differently and focus not on the digital asset itself, but on the circumstances surrounding the digital asset and the manner in which it is sold. To that end, a better line of inquiry is: “Can a digital asset that was originally offered in a securities offering ever be later sold in a manner that does not constitute an offering of a security?” In cases where the digital asset represents a set of rights that gives the holder a financial interest in an enterprise, the answer is likely “no.” In these cases, calling the transaction an initial coin offering, or “ICO,” or a sale of a “token,” will not take it out of the purview of the U.S. securities laws.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But what about cases where there is no longer any central enterprise being invested in or where the digital asset is sold only to be used to purchase a good or service available through the network on which it was created? I believe in these cases the answer is a qualified “yes.” I would like to share my thinking with you today about the circumstances under which that could occur.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before I turn to the securities law analysis, let me share what I believe may be most exciting about distributed ledger technology&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that is, the potential to share information, transfer value, and record transactions in a decentralized digital environment. Potential applications include supply chain management, intellectual property rights licensing, stock ownership transfers and countless others. There is real value in creating applications that can be accessed and executed electronically with a public, immutable record and without the need for a trusted third party to verify transactions. Some people believe that this technology will transform e-commerce as we know it. There is excitement and a great deal of speculative interest around this new technology. Unfortunately, there also are cases of fraud. In many regards, it is still “early days.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But I am not here to discuss the promise of technology&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;there are many in attendance and speaking here today that can do a much better job of that. I would like to focus on the application of the federal securities laws to digital asset transactions&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that is how tokens and coins are being issued, distributed and sold. While perhaps a bit dryer than the promise of the blockchain, this topic is critical to the broader acceptance and use of these novel instruments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I will begin by describing what I often see. Promoters, in order to raise money to develop networks on which digital assets will operate, often sell the tokens or coins rather than sell shares, issue notes or obtain bank financing. But, in many cases, the economic substance is the same as a conventional securities offering. Funds are raised with the expectation that the promoters will build their system and investors can earn a return on the instrument&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;usually by selling their tokens in the secondary market once the promoters create something of value with the proceeds and the value of the digital enterprise increases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we see that kind of economic transaction, it is easy to apply the Supreme Court&#8217;s “investment contract” test first announced in SEC v. Howey. That test requires an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others. And it is important to reflect on the facts of Howey. A hotel operator sold interests in a citrus grove to its guests and claimed it was selling real estate, not securities. While the transaction was recorded as a real estate sale, it also included a service contract to cultivate and harvest the oranges. The purchasers could have arranged to service the grove themselves but, in fact, most were passive, relying on the efforts of Howey-in-the-Hills Service, Inc. for a return. In articulating the test for an investment contract, the Supreme Court stressed: “Form [is] disregarded for substance and the emphasis [is] placed upon economic reality.” So the purported real estate purchase was found to be an investment contract&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;an investment in orange groves was in these circumstances an investment in a security.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just as in the Howey case, tokens and coins are often touted as assets that have a use in their own right, coupled with a promise that the assets will be cultivated in a way that will cause them to grow in value, to be sold later at a profit. And, as in Howey&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;where interests in the groves were sold to hotel guests, not farmers&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;tokens and coins typically are sold to a wide audience rather than to persons who are likely to use them on the network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the ICOs I have seen, overwhelmingly, promoters tout their ability to create an innovative application of blockchain technology. Like in Howey, the investors are passive. Marketing efforts are rarely narrowly targeted to token users. And typically at the outset, the business model and very viability of the application is still uncertain. The purchaser usually has no choice but to rely on the efforts of the promoter to build the network and make the enterprise a success. At that stage, the purchase of a token looks a lot like a bet on the success of the enterprise and not the purchase of something used to exchange for goods or services on the network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an aside, you might ask, given that these token sales often look like securities offerings, why are the promoters choosing to package the investment as a coin or token offering? This is an especially good question if the network on which the token or coin will function is not yet operational. I think there can be a number of reasons. For a while, some believed such labeling might, by itself, remove the transaction from the securities laws. I think people now realize labeling an investment opportunity as a coin or token does not achieve that result. Second, this labeling might have been used to bring some marketing “sizzle” to the enterprise. That might still work to some extent, but the track record of ICOs is still being sorted out and some of that sizzle may now be more of a potential warning flare for investors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some may be attracted to a blockchain-mediated crowdfunding process. Digital assets can represent an efficient way to reach a global audience where initial purchasers have a stake in the success of the network and become part of a network where their participation adds value beyond their investment contributions. The digital assets are then exchanged&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for some, to help find the market price for the new application; for others, to speculate on the venture. As I will discuss, whether a transaction in a coin or token on the secondary market amounts to an offer or sale of a security requires a careful and fact-sensitive legal analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I believe some industry participants are beginning to realize that, in some circumstances, it might be easier to start a blockchain-based enterprise in a more conventional way. In other words, conduct the initial funding through a registered or exempt equity or debt offering and, once the network is up and running, distribute or offer blockchain-based tokens or coins to participants who need the functionality the network and the digital assets offer. This allows the tokens or coins to be structured and offered in a way where it is evident that purchasers are not making an investment in the development of the enterprise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Returning to the ICOs I am seeing, strictly speaking, the token&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;or coin or whatever the digital information packet is called&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;all by itself is not a security, just as the orange groves in Howey were not. Central to determining whether a security is being sold is how it is being sold and the reasonable expectations of purchasers. When someone buys a housing unit to live in, it is probably not a security. But under certain circumstances, the same asset can be offered and sold in a way that causes investors to have a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others. For example, if the housing unit is offered with a management contract or other services, it can be a security. Similarly, when a CD, exempt from being treated as a security under Section 3 of the Securities Act, is sold as a part of a program organized by a broker who offers retail investors promises of liquidity and the potential to profit from changes in interest rates, the Gary Plastic case teaches us that the instrument can be part of an investment contract that is a security.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same reasoning applies to digital assets. The digital asset itself is simply code. But the way it is sold&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;as part of an investment; to non-users; by promoters to develop the enterprise&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;can be, and, in that context, most often is, a security&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;because it evidences an investment contract. And regulating these transactions as securities transactions makes sense. The impetus of the Securities Act is to remove the information asymmetry between promoters and investors. In a public distribution, the Securities Act prescribes the information investors need to make an informed investment decision, and the promoter is liable for material misstatements in the offering materials. These are important safeguards, and they are appropriate for most ICOs. The disclosures required under the federal securities laws nicely complement the Howey investment contract element about the efforts of others. As an investor, the success of the enterprise&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and the ability to realize a profit on the investment&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;turns on the efforts of the third party. So learning material information about the third party&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;its background, financing, plans, financial stake and so forth&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;is a prerequisite to making an informed investment decision. Without a regulatory framework that promotes disclosure of what the third party alone knows of these topics and the risks associated with the venture, investors will be uninformed and are at risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But this also points the way to when a digital asset transaction may no longer represent a security offering. If the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;where purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the assets may not represent an investment contract. Moreover, when the efforts of the third party are no longer a key factor for determining the enterprise&#8217;s success, material information asymmetries recede. As a network becomes truly decentralized, the ability to identify an issuer or promoter to make the requisite disclosures becomes difficult, and less meaningful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And so, when I look at Bitcoin today, I do not see a central third party whose efforts are a key determining factor in the enterprise. The network on which Bitcoin functions is operational and appears to have been decentralized for some time, perhaps from inception. Applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to the offer and resale of Bitcoin would seem to add little value. And putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. And, as with Bitcoin, applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to current transactions in Ether would seem to add little value. Over time, there may be other sufficiently decentralized networks and systems where regulating the tokens or coins that function on them as securities may not be required. And of course there will continue to be systems that rely on central actors whose efforts are a key to the success of the enterprise. In those cases, application of the securities laws protects the investors who purchase the tokens or coins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I would like to emphasize that the analysis of whether something is a security is not static and does not strictly inhere to the instrument. Even digital assets with utility that function solely as a means of exchange in a decentralized network could be packaged and sold as an investment strategy that can be a security. If a promoter were to place Bitcoin in a fund or trust and sell interests, it would create a new security. Similarly, investment contracts can be made out of virtually any asset (including virtual assets), provided the investor is reasonably expecting profits from the promoter&#8217;s efforts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let me emphasize an earlier point: simply labeling a digital asset a “utility token” does not turn the asset into something that is not a security. I recognize that the Supreme Court has acknowledged that if someone is purchasing an asset for consumption only, it is likely not a security. But, the economic substance of the transaction always determines the legal analysis, not the labels. The oranges in Howey had utility. Or in my favorite example, the Commission warned in the late 1960s about investment contracts sold in the form of whisky warehouse receipts. Promoters sold the receipts to U.S. investors to finance the aging and blending processes of Scotch whisky. The whisky was real&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and, for some, had exquisite utility. But Howey was not selling oranges and the warehouse receipts promoters were not selling whisky for consumption. They were selling investments, and the purchasers were expecting a return from the promoters' efforts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Promoters and other market participants need to understand whether transactions in a particular digital asset involve the sale of a security. We are happy to help promoters and their counsel work through these issues. We stand prepared to provide more formal interpretive or no-action guidance about the proper characterization of a digital asset in a proposed use. In addition, we recognize that there are numerous implications under the federal securities laws of a particular asset being considered a security. For example, our Divisions of Trading and Markets and Investment Management are focused on such issues as broker-dealer, exchange and fund registration, as well as matters of market manipulation, custody and valuation. We understand that market participants are working to make their services compliant with the existing regulatory framework, and we are happy to continue our engagement in this process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What are some of the factors to consider in assessing whether a digital asset is offered as an investment contract and is thus a security? Primarily, consider whether a third party&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;be it a person, entity or coordinated group of actors&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;drives the expectation of a return. That question will always depend on the particular facts and circumstances, and this list is illustrative, not exhaustive:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Is there a person or group that has sponsored or promoted the creation and sale of the digital asset, the efforts of whom play a significant role in the development and maintenance of the asset and its potential increase in value?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has this person or group retained a stake or other interest in the digital asset such that it would be motivated to expend efforts to cause an increase in value in the digital asset? Would purchasers reasonably believe such efforts will be undertaken and may result in a return on their investment in the digital asset?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has the promoter raised an amount of funds in excess of what may be needed to establish a functional network, and, if so, has it indicated how those funds may be used to support the value of the tokens or to increase the value of the enterprise? Does the promoter continue to expend funds from proceeds or operations to enhance the functionality and/or value of the system within which the tokens operate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are purchasers “investing,” that is seeking a return? In that regard, is the instrument marketed and sold to the general public instead of to potential users of the network for a price that reasonably correlates with the market value of the good or service in the network?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does application of the Securities Act protections make sense? Is there a person or entity others are relying on that plays a key role in the profit-making of the enterprise such that disclosure of their activities and plans would be important to investors? Do informational asymmetries exist between the promoters and potential purchasers/investors in the digital asset?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do persons or entities other than the promoter exercise governance rights or meaningful influence?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While these factors are important in analyzing the role of any third party, there are contractual or technical ways to structure digital assets so they function more like a consumer item and less like a security. Again, we would look to the economic substance of the transaction, but promoters and their counsels should consider these, and other, possible features. This list is not intended to be exhaustive and by no means do I believe each and every one of these factors needs to be present to establish a case that a token is not being offered as a security. This list is meant to prompt thinking by promoters and their counsel, and start the dialogue with the staff&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it is not meant to be a list of all necessary factors in a legal analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Is token creation commensurate with meeting the needs of users or, rather, with feeding speculation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are independent actors setting the price or is the promoter supporting the secondary market for the asset or otherwise influencing trading?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it clear that the primary motivation for purchasing the digital asset is for personal use or consumption, as compared to investment? Have purchasers made representations as to their consumptive, as opposed to their investment, intent? Are the tokens available in increments that correlate with a consumptive versus investment intent?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the tokens distributed in ways to meet users' needs? For example, can the tokens be held or transferred only in amounts that correspond to a purchaser&#8217;s expected use? Are there built-in incentives that compel using the tokens promptly on the network, such as having the tokens degrade in value over time, or can the tokens be held for extended periods for investment?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the asset marketed and distributed to potential users or the general public?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the assets dispersed across a diverse user base or concentrated in the hands of a few that can exert influence over the application?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the application fully functioning or in early stages of development?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are exciting legal times and I am pleased to be part of a process that can help promoters of this new technology and their counsel navigate and comply with the federal securities laws.</p>

<p>Based on the facts presented, the Division will not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if, in reliance on your opinion as counsel that the Tokens are not securities, TKJ offers and sells the Tokens without registration under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Capitalized terms have the same meanings as defined in your letter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In reaching this position, we particularly note that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>TKJ will not use any funds from Token sales to develop the TKJ Platform, Network, or App, and each of these will be fully developed and operational at the time any Tokens are sold;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Tokens will be immediately usable for their intended functionality (purchasing air charter services) at the time they are sold;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TKJ will restrict transfers of Tokens to TKJ Wallets only, and not to wallets external to the Platform;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TKJ will sell Tokens at a price of one USD per Token throughout the life of the Program, and each Token will represent a TKJ obligation to supply air charter services at a value of one USD per Token;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If TKJ offers to repurchase Tokens, it will only do so at a discount to the face value of the Tokens (one USD per Token) that the holder seeks to resell to TKJ, unless a court within the United States orders TKJ to liquidate the Tokens; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Token is marketed in a manner that emphasizes the functionality of the Token, and not the potential for the increase in the market value of the Token.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This position is based on the representations made to the Division in your letter. Any different facts or conditions might require the Division to reach a different conclusion. Further, this response expresses the Division&#8217;s position on enforcement action only and does not express any legal conclusion on the question presented.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contends that LBRY, Inc. offered and sold unregistered securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. LBRY responds that it does not need to comply with the Securities Act because its alleged security, a blockchain token called LBC, is not a security at all. Instead, it argues that LBC functions as a digital currency that is an essential component of the LBRY Blockchain. LBRY also a sserts that the SEC&#8217;s attempt to treat LBC as a security violates its right to due process because the agency did not give LBRY fair notice that its offerings of LBC are subject to the securities laws. The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment addressing both issues</p>

<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><strong>I&period; <span class="underline">BACKGROUND</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The nascent technology known as blockchain operates in the background of this dispute. From its earliest days, proponents of blockchain technology have envisioned it as fundamentally altering many aspects of modern life. See Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (2008), <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" class="bare">https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf</a> (outlining the idea for a peer-topeer electronic payment system). As LBRY explains, a blockchain is essentially a “decentralized ledger maintained by a network of independently owned computers.” See Kauffman Decl., <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682">Doc. No. 61-3</a> at 2 ¶ 5. Verified data is held in decentralized “block[s]” linked together via cryptographic consensus protocols. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682">id.</a> at 2 ¶ 9.

Digital tokens are used to compensate “miners” who validate transactions and allow for peer-to-peer “transfers of value,” which are then logged in the decentralized ledger. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682">id.</a> at 2 ¶¶ 6, 9; see also <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I31dd31c0c1a211e491e799abcaf7f975/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_999_1">Morici v.

Nor does it argue that its past offerings fall within an exemption to the registration requirement. Thus, the only issues impeding a finding that LBRY violated Section 5 are LBRY&#8217;s claim that it did not offer LBC as a security and its argument that it was not given fair notice that it needed to register its offerings.

The First Circuit has broken the Howey test into three parts: “(1) the investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with an expectation of profits to be derived solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.” <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I13202b1079bf11d9ac1ffa9f33b6c3b0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_48">SG Ltd., 265 F.3d at 46</a>.

I analyze the evidence that bears on this issue by first examining LBRY&#8217;s representations to prospective purchasers and the company&#8217;s business model. I then turn to LBRY&#8217;s argument that it has not offered LBC as a security because some purchasers acquired LBC for use on the LBRY Network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1&period; LBRY&#8217;s Representations to Potential Purchasers</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The SEC identifies multiple statements by LBRY that it claims led potential investors to reasonably expect that LBC would grow in value as the company continued to oversee the development of the LBRY Network. LBRY minimizes the significance of these statements, and points to its many disclaimers that it did not intend for LBC to be purchased as an investment, but the SEC is correct. LBRY has - at key moments and despite its protestations - been acutely aware of LBC&#8217;s potential value as an investment. And it made sure potential investors were too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>When LBRY launched the LBRY Network in June 2016, LBC&#8217;s market capitalization was a healthy $140 million. <span class="underline">See</span> 7/15/2016 LBRY Article, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">Doc. No. 57-11</a>. This, despite the Network&#8217;s relative infancy and limited usability. By the following month, LBC&#8217;s market capitalization had ballooned to $1.2 billion. <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">Id.</a> In response, LBRY issued a blog post reflecting on LBC&#8217;s skyrocketing value. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">id.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>LBRY captioned the post: “1.2B Market Cap and We Don&#8217;t Care.” Id. It began by touting the rapid growth in LBC&#8217;s value, but frankly acknowledged that it could not say whether the current valuation was justified. <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">id.</a> At that point, only three videos were available on the blockchain, each produced by LBRY itself. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">id.</a> And LBRY&#8217;s staff were hard at work “frantically debugging” and developing its product. <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">id.</a> What LBRY did claim to know though was “that the long-term value proposition of LBRY is tremendous, but also dependent on our team staying focused on the task at hand: building this thing.” <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">id.</a> It then closed the post by announcing a policy of neutrality with respect to LBC&#8217;s price but plainly stating that “[o]ver the long-term, the interests of LBRY and the holders of [LBC] are aligned.” <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">id.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In August 2016, the COO of LBRY, Josh Finer, emailed a potential investor explaining that the company was “currently negotiating private placements of LBC with several [other] investors” and asked the recipient to write him back “if there is interest” so the two could “chat.” <span class="underline">See</span> COO Email, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488">Doc. No. 59-7</a>.<a href="#sec_v_lbry_footnote_3"><strong><sup><em>(3)</em></sup></strong></a> The thrust of the email (subject line: “LBRY Credits Now Trading – LBC”) is clear. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488">id.</a> After briefly noting that the platform was up and running, the COO explained how LBC are being traded on “major crypto exchanges” and that trading volume is moving at a healthy clip. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488">id.</a> The “opportunity is obvious,” wrote the COO, “buy a bunch of credits, put them away safely, and hope that in 1-3 years we&#8217;ve appreciated even 10% of how much Bitcoin has in the past few years.” <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488">id.</a> He wraps up by pitching LBRY&#8217;s commitment to building its Network: “[i]f our product has the utility we plan, the credits should appreciate accordingly.” <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488">id.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>By November 2016, LBC&#8217;s price was down, and some LBC investors were getting jittery. Jeremy Kauffman, LBRY&#8217;s CEO, published a blog post titled “Acryptypical: The CEO of LBRY on the price of LBC,” outlining his view of LBRY&#8217;s condition and providing “a canonical answer to questions about the price of LBC.” <span class="underline">See</span> 11/15/2016 Article, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463">Doc. No. 57-21</a>. LBC&#8217;s price was low, he contended, because of simple economics: the supply of LBC entering circulation through mining was outpacing the demand for new tokens. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463">id.</a> And demand was low because, at that point, “there [was] no reason to buy” LBC. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463">id.</a> When LBRY launched, Kauffman explained, it was “the barest, minimum proof-of-concept [application] possible.” <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463">id.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Although it had only been a few months since the launch, LBRY still stressed its long-term goal of “buil[ding] a product that is compelling enough to change people&#8217;s habits,” replacing “YouTube” and “Amazon.” <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463">id.</a> And while investors were unlikely to make a “quick buck,” Kauffman encouraged them to “hold onto [their LBC] (or spend it to buy some of [LBRY&#8217;s] great content . . . .).” <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463">id.</a> LBRY&#8217;s message was clear: We are a work in progress. LBC reflects that. Bear with us.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In another communication, this time on Reddit, a user who was “trying to do [their] research before putting in [their] money” asked some general questions about how LBRY would manage its holdings of LBC. <span class="underline">See</span> Reddit Thread, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791462">Doc. No. 57-20</a>. In response, LBRY&#8217;s Community Manager explained that the only way LBC will be “worth something in the future is if LBRY delivers on their promises to create a revolutionary way to share and monetize content.” <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791462">id.</a> The thread also includes another Redditor advising the community manager on what information “would help people with their investment decisions.” <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791462">id.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Another relevant representation came in an interview with Mike Vine, LBRY&#8217;s “Technology Evangelist”. <span class="underline">See</span> Vine Interview, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791461">Doc.

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In January 2018, Kauffman wrote further on the benefits of blockchain technology in another essay entitled “Blockchain is Love, Blockchain is Life.”
<span class="underline">See</span> 1/10/2018 LBRY Article, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458">Doc. No. 57-16</a>. There, he wrote about what he called the “incentive problem[]” in developing open-source alternatives to existing technologies that are controlled by private companies. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458">id.</a> One solution to this problem, as Kauffman saw it, was to be found in blockchain technology, which allowed for blockchain tokens to be used to realign incentives. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458">id.</a> Because a blockchain token “has value in proportion to the usage and success of the network,” developers are incentivized to work to develop and promote new uses for blockchain. <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458">Id.</a> As Kauffman put it:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p><span class="quoteblock"><code><em>"It means that the people who discover and utilize a new protocol or network when it&#8217;s just getting off the ground can reap substantial value by being there first. This solves the incentive problems around being a first-mover and softens the pain of using a service that probably won&#8217;t be as feature-rich or slick as established competitors' options. It provides a source of funding for the development of the protocol. The creators can use the token to pay for the salaries and equipment required to get it started."</em></code></span></p>

<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>And in yet another post, this time in October 2020, LBRY provided another positive update. <span class="underline">See</span> 10/14/2020 LBRY Article, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466">Doc. No. 57-24</a>. It explained that it still saw itself as meeting the consumer “demand for a userowned and controlled alternative to YouTube and big tech.” <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466">id.</a> Indeed, its work creating a “compelling token economy centered around digital content exchange” was still “imminently achievable” with just “some tweaks.” <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466">id.</a> LBRY also touted the enormous potential it saw in continuing to develop its application on its blockchain. Other blockchain companies, the post asserted, are forced to rely on “some third-party” to “magicly [sic] build a world-class application” on their blockchains. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466">id.</a> Not LBRY. And since “[a]pplications used by billions of people can be worth trillions of dollars,” LBRY was uniquely poised to “deliver that value” by “own[ing] the whole stack.” <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466">id.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>These statements are representative of LBRY&#8217;s overall messaging about the growth potential for LBC, and thus the SEC is correct that potential investors would understand that LBRY was pitching a speculative value proposition for its digital token. LBRY&#8217;s messaging amounts to precisely the “not-very-subtle form of economic inducement” the First Circuit identified in <span class="underline">SG</span> as evidencing <span class="underline">Howey&#8217;s</span> “expectation of profits.” <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I13202b1079bf11d9ac1ffa9f33b6c3b0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_54">SG Ltd., 265 F.3d at 54-55</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>LBRY does not disavow its statements regarding LBC&#8217;s value or price, but notes that the statements the SEC identifies constitute only 0.25% of “the total number of posts and messages the company has published since its inception.” <span class="underline">See</span> Def.'s Obj., <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845">Doc. No. 74</a> at 5. But this statistic relies on a misleading denominator. Of course, like many other companies, LBRY regularly publishes statements on a range of topics, and could not argue that the 8,805 tweets it identified having posted, <span class="underline">see</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845">id.</a>, all pertain in equal measure to its views of LBC&#8217;s long-term value proposition. Since LBRY makes no effort to tally the number of comparable statements to those identified by the SEC, its argument lacks weight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>LBRY also relies on the fact that it informed some potential purchasers of LBC that the company was not offering its token as an investment. But a disclaimer cannot undo the objective economic realities of a transaction. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I4ba864e06e4411eaafc9a4147037e074/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_7903_365">SEC v.

<p>2&period; LBRY&#8217;s Business Model</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>As I just laid out, LBRY made no secret in its communications with potential investors that it expected LBC to grow in value through its managerial and entrepreneurial efforts. But even if it had never explicitly broadcast its views on the subject, any reasonable investor who was familiar with the company&#8217;s business model would have understood the connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>From its inception, LBRY&#8217;s profitability turned on its ability to grow the value of LBC by increasing usage of the LBRY Network. As Kauffman explained in an October 2016 informal business plan, LBC was the means by which LBRY and other early adopters would be able to profit as use of the network increased. <span class="underline">See</span> LBRY Plan, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030">Doc. No. 62-2</a> at 9. This was because “[e]ach percentage of [LBC] can be thought of as having a value proportional to the sum of all information transacted through the network.” <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030">Id.</a> In other words, as demand for information stored on the blockchain increased, so too would LBC&#8217;s value. Accordingly, Kauffman reasoned, “[g]iven this situation, the most reasonable path to profit is to reserve a portion of the cryptocurrency.” <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030">Id.</a> Later in the same plan, he discussed the company&#8217;s liquidation value by stating “[s]ince LBRY&#8217;s most significant asset will be its credits, it could simply liquify these credits at a return of 10-10,000x on any investment.” <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030">Id.</a> at 10.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Similarly, in a post on its website titled “Answers to Big Questions From our Reddit AMA,” LBRY responded to the question “How does the company behind LBRY make money?” by stating:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p><span class="quoteblock"><code><em>"The LBRY protocol has a built-in digital currency that allows it to function, called LBRY Credits. These Credits are very similar to bitcoins. Having a built-in digital currency creates an opportunity for a new kind of business that has never existed: the protocolfirst enterprise . . . LBRY Inc. has reserved 10% of all LBRY Credits to fund continued development and provide profit for the founders. Since Credits only gain value as the use of the protocol grows, the company has an incentive to continue developing this open-source project."</em></code></span></p>

<p>9/28/2016 LBRY Article, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791450">Doc. No. 57-8</a>.<br/></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The problem for LBRY is not just that a reasonable purchaser of LBC would understand that the tokens being offered represented investment opportunities - even if LBRY never said a word about it. It is that, by retaining hundreds of millions of LBC for itself, LBRY also signaled that it was motivated to work tirelessly to improve the value of its blockchain for itself and any LBC purchasers. This structure, which any reasonable purchaser would understand, would lead purchasers of LBC to expect that they too would profit from their holdings of LBC as a result of LBRY&#8217;s assiduous efforts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Simply put, by intertwining LBRY&#8217;s financial fate with the commercial success of LBC, LBRY made it obvious to its investors that it would work diligently to develop the Network so that LBC would increase in value. As LBRY said, “[o]ver the long-term, the interests of LBRY and the holders of Credits are aligned.” <span class="underline">See</span> 7/15/2016 LBRY Article, <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">Doc. No. 57-11</a>. The SEC&#8217;s burden is made all the easier by statements LBRY made about its managerial efforts, like how “the long-term value proposition of LBRY is . . . dependent on our team staying focused on the task at hand: building this thing.” <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453">id.</a> By its own account, LBRY expended significant managerial efforts to develop its Network and increase the value of LBC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>3&period; Consumptive Uses for LBC</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>LBRY&#8217;s primary response to the SEC&#8217;s claim starts with two generally uncontested facts: (1) LBC is a utility token designed for use on the LBRY Blockchain, and (2) some unknown number of purchasers of LBC acquired it at least in part with the intention of using it rather than holding it as an investment. Building from there, LBRY leaps to the conclusion that LBC cannot be a security even if LBRY offered it as an investment. LBRY is mistaken about both the facts and the law.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Nothing in the case law suggests that a token with both consumptive and speculative uses cannot be sold as an investment contract. Despite LBRY&#8217;s insistence to the contrary, I cannot reject the SEC&#8217;s contention that LBRY offered LBC as a security simply because some LBC purchases were made with consumptive intent. Were it otherwise, the Securities Act would be unable to adapt to the “countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits” wherever a token held some consumptive utility. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I22292b4f9bf011d993e6d35cc61aab4a/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_780_299">Howey, 328 U.S.</a> at 299.
Accordingly, statements from a subset of LBC holders that they purchased LBC for use on the LBRY Blockchain is of limited relevance in determining whether LBRY offered it as a security. <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I14265fa660e511deb08de1b7506ad85b/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_1021">Warfield, 569 F.3d</a> at 1021 (“[W]hile the subjective intent of the purchasers may have some bearing on the issue of whether they entered into investment contracts, we must focus our inquiry on what the purchasers were offered or promised.”).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>In summary, what the evidence in the record discloses is that LBRY promoted LBC as an investment that would grow in value over time through the company&#8217;s development of the LBRY Network. While some unknown number of purchasers may have acquired LBC in part for consumptive purposes, this does not change the fact that the objective economic realities of LBRY&#8217;s offerings of LBC establish that it was offering it as a security.<a href="#sec_v_lbry_footnote_4"><strong><sup><em>(4)</em></sup></strong></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>B&period; Did LBRY Receive Fair Notice?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>LBRY argues that I should nonetheless deny the SEC&#8217;s motion because it did not receive fair notice that its offerings were subject to the securities laws. In pressing this argument, LBRY has abandoned any broad claim that it lacked fair notice of the way in which the <span class="underline">Howey</span> test applies to digital tokens in general. Def.'s Obj., <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845">Doc. No. 74</a> at 24. Instead, it complains that it lacked fair notice because, until the SEC brought this action, “the Commission historically and consistently focused its guidance, as well as its enforcement efforts, exclusively on the issuance of digital assets in the context of an [Initial Coin Offering] ICO.” <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845">Id.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The principal problem with LBRY&#8217;s fair notice argument is that it offers nothing more to support its position than its bald claim that this is the first case in which the SEC has attempted to enforce the registration requirement against an issuer of digital tokens that did not conduct an ICO.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>LBRY does not point to any specific statement by the SEC suggesting that companies need only comply with the registration requirement if they conduct an ICO. Nor does LBRY offer any persuasive reading of <span class="underline">Howey</span> that would cause a reasonable issuer to conclude that only ICOs are subject to the registration requirement. The test outlined in <span class="underline">Howey</span> is necessarily a factspecific one, in which no single fact will likely be dispositive. While participation in an ICO may be relevant to the analysis, it will not determine the outcome in a case like this, where the undisputed evidence leaves no doubt that LBRY offered and sold LBC as a security.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>LBRY relies on the Second Circuit&#8217;s decision in <span class="underline">Upton v. SEC</span> for the proposition that the SEC may not impose a sanction for violating the securities laws “pursuant to a substantial change in its enforcement policy that was not reasonably communicated to the public.” <span class="underline">See</span> <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_98">75 F.3d 92, 98 (2nd Cir. 1996)</a>. But, as the SEC notes, the facts of <span class="underline">Upton</span> bear no resemblance to the present case. <span class="underline">Upton</span> involved an attempt by the SEC to sanction the CFO of a brokerage firm for violating an SEC rule that established a formula for setting the amount of money that the brokerage was required to maintain in a customer reserve account. <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_93">Id.</a> at 93. Although it was undisputed that the brokerage had at all times complied with the “literal terms” of the rule, an administrative law judge relied on a novel interpretation of the rule by the SEC to conclude that the CFO could be sanctioned. <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_94">Id.</a> at 94-96. Because the SEC did not give public notice of its new interpretation until after the brokerage had ended its offensive practice, the Second Circuit vacated the sanction imposed by the Commission. <a href="https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0&amp;fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_94">Id.</a> at 98.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>The present case is obviously quite different from the problem the court confronted in <span class="underline">Upton</span>. The SEC has not based its enforcement action here on a novel interpretation of a rule that by its terms does not expressly prohibit the relevant conduct. Instead, the SEC has based its claim on a straightforward application of a venerable Supreme Court precedent that has been applied by hundreds of federal courts across the country over more than 70 years. While this may be the first time it has been used against an issuer of digital tokens that did not conduct an ICO, LBRY is in no position to claim that it did not receive fair notice that its conduct was unlawful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><strong>IV&period; <span class="underline">CONCLUSION</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>As I have explained, the only issues raised by the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment are whether LBRY offered LBC as a security and whether LBRY received fair notice that it needed to register its offerings. Because no reasonable trier of fact could reject the SEC&#8217;s contention that LBRY offered LBC as a security, and LBRY does not have a triable defense that it lacked fair notice, the SEC is entitled to judgment. The SEC&#8217;s Motion for Summary J udgment (<a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791412">Doc. No. 55</a>) is granted, and LBRY&#8217;s Motion for Summary Judgment (<a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791679">Doc. No. 61</a>) is denied. The Clerk shall schedule a status conference to discuss the process for resolving any remaining issues.</p>
