</div>
<div class="paragraph text-justify">
<p>Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), for its complaint
against Caroline Ellison (“Ellison”) and Zixiao “Gary” Wang (“Wang,” together with Ellison,
“Defendants”), alleges as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><span class="underline"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="1">
<li>
<p>From at least May 2019 through November 2022, Defendants, together with Samuel Bankman-Fried (“Bankman-Fried”) and others, engaged in a scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX Trading Ltd. (“FTX”), the crypto asset trading platform of which Bankman-Fried and Wang were co-founders, at the same time that they were also defrauding the platform’s customers.<a href="#ellison_wang_footnote_1"><strong><sup><em>(1)</em></sup></strong></a> FTX raised more than $1.8 billion from investors, including U.S. investors, who bought an equity stake in FTX believing that FTX had appropriate controls and risk management measures. Unbeknownst to those investors (and to FTX’s trading customers), Bankman-Fried was orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud, diverting billions of dollars of the trading platform’s customer funds for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire. Defendants were active participants in the scheme and engaged in conduct that was critical to its success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout this period, Bankman-Fried portrayed himself as a responsible leader of the crypto community. He touted the importance of regulation and accountability. He told the public, including investors, that FTX was both innovative and responsible. Customers around the world believed his lies, and sent billions of dollars to FTX, believing their assets were secure on the FTX trading platform. But Bankman-Fried and Wang improperly diverted customer assets to Alameda Research LLC and its subsidiaries (“Alameda”), the crypto asset hedge fund that they had founded and co-owned and that Ellison ran. Wang created and participated in the creation of the software code that allowed Alameda to divert FTX customer funds. Ellison, in turn, used the misappropriated FTX customer funds for Alameda’s trading activity. And Bankman-Fried used those customer funds to make undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working with Bankman-Fried, Defendants hid the scheme from FTX’s equity investors, including U.S. investors, from whom FTX sought to raise billions of dollars in additional funds. Bankman-Fried repeatedly cast FTX as an innovative and conservative trailblazer in the crypto markets. He told investors and prospective investors that FTX had topnotch, sophisticated automated risk measures in place to protect customer assets, that those assets were safe and secure, and that Alameda was just another platform customer with no special privileges. Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that these statements were false and misleading. In truth, Bankman-Fried and Wang, with Ellison’s knowledge and consent, had exempted Alameda from the risk mitigation measures and had provided Alameda with significant special treatment on the FTX platform, including a virtually unlimited “line of credit” funded by the platform’s customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beyond its “line of credit” with FTX, Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, caused Alameda to borrow billions of dollars from third party lenders. Those loans were backed in significant part by Alameda’s holdings of FTT—an illiquid crypto asset security that was issued by FTX and provided to Alameda at no cost. Ellison, acting at the direction of Bankman-Fried, engaged in automated purchases of FTT tokens on various platforms in order to increase the price of those tokens and inflate the value of Alameda’s collateral, which allowed Alameda to borrow even more money from external lenders at increased risk to the lenders and to FTX’s investors and customers, all in furtherance of the scheme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While Bankman-Fried spent lavishly on office space and condominiums in The Bahamas, and sank billions of dollars of customer funds into speculative venture investments, his house of cards began to crumble. When prices of crypto assets plummeted in May 2022, Alameda’s lenders demanded repayment on billions of dollars of loans. Despite the fact that
Alameda had, by this point, already taken billions of dollars of FTX customer assets, it was unable to satisfy its loan obligations. Bankman-Fried, with Defendants’ knowledge, directed FTX to divert billions more in customer assets to Alameda to ensure that Alameda maintained its lending relationships, and that money could continue to flow in from lenders and other investors. Ellison then used FTX’s customer assets to pay Alameda’s debts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even as it was increasingly clear that Alameda and FTX could not make customers whole, Bankman-Fried and Defendants continued to misappropriate FTX customer funds. Through the summer of 2022, Bankman-Fried, with Defendants’ knowledge, directed hundreds of millions more in FTX customer funds to Alameda, which he then used for additional venture investments and for “loans” to himself and other FTX executives, including Wang. All the while, Bankman-Fried continued to make misleading statements to investors about FTX’s financial condition and risk management. Defendants were aware that Bankman-Fried was making these statements, and knew or were reckless in not knowing that they were false and misleading. Even in November 2022, faced with billions of dollars in customer withdrawal demands that FTX could not fulfill, Bankman-Fried and Ellison, with Wang’s knowledge, misled investors from whom they needed money to plug a multi-billion-dollar hole. This brazen, multiyear scheme finally came to an end when FTX, Alameda, and their tangled web of affiliated entities filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="18">
<li>
<p>In or around October 2017, Bankman-Fried and Wang founded Alameda, a quantitative trading firm specializing in crypto assets. <a href="#ellison_wang_footnote_3"><strong><sup><em>(3)</em></sup></strong></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At inception, Alameda was focused on arbitrage trading strategies, but went on to employ other strategies including market making, yield farming (pooling of crypto assets in exchange for interest or other rewards), and volatility trading. Alameda also offered over-thecounter trading services, and made and managed other debt and equity investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At first, Bankman-Fried was responsible for trading operations, and Wang handled the engineering and programming functions. Over time, Alameda hired additional employees, including Singh (in or around December 2017), Ellison (in or around March 2018), and Trabucco (in or around 2019). By the end of 2021, Alameda had approximately 30 employees. At times, Alameda shared office space and employees with FTX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried remained the ultimate decision-maker at Alameda, even after Ellison and Trabucco became co-CEOs in or around October 2021. Bankman-Fried directed investment and operational decisions, frequently communicated with Alameda employees, and had full access to Alameda’s records and databases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ellison was a trader at Alameda during the time Bankman-Fried acted as CEO. When Ellison became co-CEO in 2021, and continuing through November 2022, Ellison was responsible for Alameda’s day-to-day operations. Though Ellison made some trading decisions, she frequently consulted with Bankman-Fried, particularly about strategic issues and significant trades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In or around 2018, Bankman-Fried began work on building a crypto asset trading platform. Together with Wang and Singh, Bankman-Fried ultimately founded FTX, which began operations in or around May 2019.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX offered its customers a number of services. For example:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>FTX offered a “spot market,” a trading platform through which customers could trade crypto assets with other FTX customers in exchange for fiat currency (i.e., currency such as U.S. Dollars) or other crypto assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX offered “spot margin trading” services, which allowed FTX customers to trade using assets they did not have (i.e., to trade “on margin”) by posting collateral in their FTX accounts and borrowing crypto assets through the “spot market” on the FTX platform. FTX also allowed customers to lend their crypto assets to other FTX customers who would then use those crypto assets to spot trade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX offered an off-platform (over-the-counter or “OTC”) portal that enabled customers to connect and request quotes for spot crypto assets and to conduct trades.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried was the ultimate decision-maker at FTX from the platform’s inception in or around May 2019 until he resigned as CEO on or about November 11, 2022 (“the Relevant Period”). Wang and Singh were the lead engineers responsible for writing the software code for FTX, including the code that allowed for the services described above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In or around January 2020, Bankman-Fried, Wang, and Singh founded FTX US, a crypto asset trading platform designed primarily for customers in the United States.<a href="#ellison_wang_footnote_4"><strong><sup><em>(4)</em></sup></strong></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over time, Bankman-Fried expanded his holdings to include a number of companies focused on making and managing private (or “venture”) investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This interconnected web of companies grew to include over 100 separate entities, with Bankman-Fried at the top and Alameda, his crypto hedge fund, at the center.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the Relevant Period, in multiple public statements, Bankman-Fried held himself out as a visionary leader in the crypto industry, and touted his efforts to create a regulated and thriving crypto asset market. He conducted an intensive public relations campaign to brand himself and his companies as honest stewards of crypto.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reality was very different: From the start, contrary to what FTX investors and trading customers were told, Bankman-Fried, actively supported by Defendants, continually diverted FTX customer funds to Alameda and then used those funds to continue to grow his empire, using billions of dollars to make undisclosed private venture investments, political contributions, and real estate purchases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, throughout the Relevant Period, Bankman-Fried, with Defendants’ knowledge, solicited equity investors by touting FTX’s controls and risk management, ultimately raising at least $1.8 billion from investors in exchange for various classes of stock in FTX through multiple fundraising rounds, including raising: (1) approximately $8 million from the sale of shares of FTX Series A preferred stock, with fundraising completed in or around August 2019; (2) approximately $1 billion from the sale of shares of FTX Series B preferred stock, with fundraising completed in or around July 2021; (3) approximately $420 million from the sale of shares of FTX Series B-1 stock, with fundraising completed in or around October 2021; and (4) approximately $500 million from the sale of shares of FTX Series C stock, with fundraising completed in or around January 2022. Of this total, approximately $1.1 billion was invested in FTX by approximately 90 investors based in the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the entire span of the Relevant Period, while raising money from equity investors, Bankman-Fried, and those speaking at his direction and on his behalf, with the knowledge of Defendants, claimed in widely distributed public forums and directly to investors that: FTX was a safe crypto asset trading platform; FTX had a comparative advantage due to its automated risk mitigation procedures; and FTX and its customers were protected from other customers’ losses due to FTX’s automated liquidation process. As discussed further herein, these statements and others were misleading in light of Bankman-Fried’s failure to disclose to FTX investors the diversion of FTX customer funds to Alameda, which he then used for his own purposes, including loans to himself. Similarly, Bankman-Fried’s statements concerning the separation of FTX and Alameda, made throughout the Relevant Period, were misleading because he did not disclose the special treatment afforded to Alameda on FTX, including its virtually unlimited “line of credit” at FTX, its ability to carry a negative balance in its FTX customer account, and its exemption from FTX’s automated liquidation process—none of which any other customer of the platform enjoyed, but which changed the risk profile of FTX. Defendants were aware that Bankman-Fried was making false or misleading statements in order to raise money for FTX from equity investors. At times, they were in close proximity to these discussions, and directly or indirectly supported Bankman-Fried in providing false and misleading information to investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried also misrepresented the risk profile of investing in FTX throughout the Relevant Period by failing to disclose FTX’s exposure to Alameda and, relatedly, that the collateral Alameda deposited on FTX consisted largely of illiquid, FTX-affiliated tokens, including FTT, the price of which Alameda was actively manipulating. In addition to these material omissions, Bankman-Fried also made material misrepresentations to FTX investors about FTX’s risk management and its relationship with Alameda. As detailed below, Bankman-Fried made these material misstatements throughout the Relevant Period, and the entire time he was raising or attempting to raise funds for FTX—from the time FTX began operations in May 2019 through its ultimate demise in November 2022. Again, Defendants were aware that Bankman-Fried was making these false or misleading statements and that he was doing so in order to raise money from equity investors, and they directly or indirectly supported him in doing so.</p>
</li>

<div class="olist upperalpha">
<ol class="upperalpha" type="A" start="2">
<li>
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Defendants Used Alameda to Carry Out the Fraudulent Scheme.</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="34">
<li>
<p>Alameda (and its many subsidiaries) served a number of essential functions in Bankman-Fried’s growing web of companies. For example, Alameda was the primary market maker on FTX at the time of FTX’s inception in 2019. In this capacity, Alameda, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, was tasked with creating liquidity on FTX to allow the platform to function more efficiently. Bankman-Fried also made venture investments through an Alameda subsidiary. Most crucially, Bankman-Fried used Alameda to house FTX customer assets and to deploy those assets, under Bankman-Fried’s direction, to help grow his empire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the inception of FTX, Defendants and Bankman-Fried diverted FTX customer funds to Alameda, and continued to do so until FTX’s collapse in November 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants and Bankman-Fried diverted FTX customer funds to Alameda in essentially two ways: (1) by directing FTX customers to deposit fiat currency (e.g., U.S. Dollars) into bank accounts controlled by Alameda; and (2) by enabling Alameda to draw down from a virtually limitless “line of credit” at FTX, which was funded by FTX customer assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result, there was no meaningful distinction between FTX customer funds and Alameda’s own funds. Bankman-Fried and Wang thus gave Alameda and Ellison carte blanche to use FTX customer assets for Alameda’s trading operations and for whatever other purposes Bankman-Fried and Ellison saw fit. In essence, Bankman-Fried and Wang placed billions of dollars of FTX customer funds into Alameda. Bankman-Fried then used Alameda as his personal piggy bank to buy luxury condominiums, support political campaigns, and make private investments, among other uses. Ellison used these funds for Alameda’s operations, including speculative trading strategies and servicing Alameda’s debt to third-party lenders. Defendants knew that none of this was disclosed to FTX equity investors or to the platform’s trading customers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist lowerroman">
<ol class="lowerroman" type="i" start="1">
<li>
<p><strong>FTX Customers Deposited Billions of Dollars into Alameda-Owned Bank Accounts, Which Alameda Spent on Its Own Trading Operations and to Expand Bankman-Fried’s Empire.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="38">
<li>
<p>From the start of FTX’s operations in or around May 2019 until at least 2021, FTX customers deposited fiat currency (e.g., U.S. Dollars) into bank accounts controlled by Alameda. Billions of dollars of FTX customer funds were so deposited into Alameda-controlled bank accounts. Ellison was aware that Alameda was receiving FTX customer funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least some of these bank accounts were not in Alameda’s name, but rather in the name of North Dimension Inc. (“North Dimension”), an Alameda subsidiary. North Dimension’s website does not disclose any connection to Alameda. Ellison knew that Bankman- Fried had directed FTX to have customers send funds to North Dimension in an effort to hide the fact that the funds were being sent to an account controlled by Alameda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda did not segregate these customer funds, but instead commingled them with its other assets, and used them indiscriminately to fund its trading operations and Bankman-Fried’s other ventures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This multi-billion-dollar liability was reflected in an internal account in the FTX database that was not tied to Alameda but was instead called “<a href="mailto:fiat@ftx.com">fiat@ftx.com</a>.” Characterizing the amount of customer funds sent to Alameda as an internal FTX account had the effect of concealing Alameda’s liability in FTX’s internal systems. Defendants knew that FTX customer funds were being sent to Alameda-controlled bank accounts and that Alameda’s liability was reflected in the “<a href="mailto:fiat@ftx.com">fiat@ftx.com</a>” account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In quarterly balance sheets that Ellison prepared, and that were provided to Alameda’s third-party lenders, Alameda tracked this liability as a “loan,” but did not specify that the “loan” was from FTX. Instead, Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, combined this liability with loans Alameda had received from third-party lenders to obscure Alameda’s intertwined financial relationship with FTX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda was not required to pay interest on the liability reflected in the “<a href="mailto:fiat@ftx.com">fiat@ftx.com</a>” account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2022, FTX began trying to separate Alameda’s portion of the liability in the “<a href="mailto:fiat@ftx.com">fiat@ftx.com</a>” account from the portion that was attributable to FTX (i.e., to separate out customer deposits sent to Alameda-controlled bank accounts from deposits sent to FTXcontrolled bank accounts). Alameda’s portion—which amounted to more than $8 billion in FTX customer assets that had been deposited into Alameda-controlled bank accounts—was initially moved to a different account in the FTX database. However, because this change caused FTX’s internal systems to automatically charge Alameda interest on the more than $8 billion liability, Bankman-Fried directed that the Alameda liability be moved to an account that would not be charged interest. This account was associated with an individual that had no apparent connection to Alameda. As a result, this change had the effect of further concealing Alameda’s liability in FTX’s internal systems.</p>

<div class="olist lowerroman">
<ol class="lowerroman" type="i" start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>The FTX Platform, By Design, Granted Special Treatment to Alameda, Including Features that Allowed Alameda to Divert FTX Customer Assets.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="45">
<li>
<p>In addition to receiving cash deposits directly from FTX customers, Alameda benefited from undisclosed features of the FTX platform, which were embedded in software code developed by Wang and other FTX engineers, and which allowed Alameda to divert FTX customer assets. For example:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Negative Balance: Alameda was able to maintain a negative balance in its customer account at FTX. Bankman-Fried directed FTX engineers, including Wang, to write software code in or around August 2019, and to update it in or around May 2020, ultimately allowing Alameda to maintain a negative balance in its account, untethered from any collateral requirements. No other customer account at FTX was permitted to maintain a negative balance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Line of Credit: On multiple occasions, Bankman-Fried directed FTX engineers, including Wang, to increase the amount by which Alameda could maintain a negative balance in its account. In effect, this gave an unofficial “line of credit” to Alameda, since Alameda was able to draw down on its FTX customer account and use those funds—which were actually the funds deposited by other FTX customers—for its own trading. At Bankman-Fried’s direction, Wang and others  continually raised the limit on Alameda’s “line of credit” to the point where it grew to tens of billions of dollars and effectively became limitless. No other FTX customer had a similar “line of credit.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liquidation Exemption: In or around May 2020, Bankman-Fried directed FTX engineers, including Wang, to exempt Alameda from the “auto-liquidation” feature of FTX’s spot margin trading services. As a result, Alameda’s collateral
could fall below the requisite margin levels without triggering the automatic liquidation of its account. Alameda was the only customer exempted from FTX’s automatic account liquidation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants were both aware that these special privileges were afforded to Alameda—and only Alameda. Defendants were also both aware that the existence of these special privileges, which were put in place at Bankman-Fried’s direction, were hidden from FTX’s investors. These privileges permitted Alameda to draw on FTX customer assets to a virtually unlimited extent for its own uses. Because its own FTX trading account was able to maintain a negative balance of billions of dollars, unbacked by sufficient collateral—as a direct result of software code implemented by Wang and others—Alameda was able to divert billions of dollars in FTX customer assets. Alameda and Ellison did just that in 2022.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist lowerroman">
<ol class="lowerroman" type="i" start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>In 2022, Alameda Diverted Billions More in FTX Customer Assets.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="47">
<li>
<p>Starting in or around 2021, Bankman-Fried directed Ellison to have Alameda borrow billions of dollars from third-party crypto asset lending firms in order to fund Bankman-Fried’s venture investments and for his personal use. Certain of these loans included provisions permitting the lenders to demand re-payment at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In or around May 2022, as prices of crypto assets were dropping precipitously, several of these lenders demanded re-payment from Alameda. Because Alameda did not have sufficient assets to cover all of these obligations, Bankman-Fried directed Ellison to draw on Alameda’s “line of credit” from FTX, which, based on the software code that Wang had previously created, allowed Alameda to borrow virtually limitless funds from FTX. Billions of dollars of FTX customer funds were thus diverted to Alameda and used by Alameda to re-pay its third-party loan obligations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because Alameda now had billions of dollars more in liability to FTX (on top of the billions of dollars reflected in the “<a href="mailto:fiat@ftx.com">fiat@ftx.com</a>” account), Bankman-Fried—concerned that this enormous liability would alarm Alameda’s lenders—directed Ellison to hide this “line of credit” in Alameda’s balance sheet. Ellison did so and presented this information to lenders, knowing that it was materially misleading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite the fact that Alameda now owed FTX billions of dollars with no immediate prospects of raising capital to pay off its “line of credit,” Bankman-Fried continued to direct Ellison to draw on the Alameda “line of credit” in the summer of 2022. The customer funds diverted to Alameda were used, among other things, to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in “loans” to Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives, as well as hundreds of millions more to fund additional venture investments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist lowerroman">
<ol class="lowerroman" type="i" start="4">
<li>
<p><strong>Bankman-Fried, with Defendants’ Knowledge and Consent, Assured Investors that FTX Customer Assets Were Secure, and Hid Alameda’s Close Relationship with FTX.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="51">
<li>
<p>Throughout the Relevant Period, Bankman-Fried was directly involved in soliciting potential investors in FTX. Bankman-Fried met, and otherwise communicated, with FTX investors, including investors based in the United States. Along with another FTX employee, Bankman-Fried was the point-person for investor relations at FTX. Defendants knew that Bankman-Fried was meeting with and soliciting funds from equity investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX’s Terms of Service, which were publicly available on FTX’s website and accessible to investors, assured FTX customers that their assets were secure, providing: “you control the Digital Assets held in your Account;” “[t]itle to your Digital Assets shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to FTX;” and “none of the digital assets in your account are the property of, or shall or may be loaned to, FTX Trading.” The Terms of Service further provided: “Once we receive fiat currency we may issue you an equivalent amount of electronic money (“E-Money”)…which represents the fiat currency that you have loaded” and “[y]ou may redeem all or part of any E-Money held in your Account at any time.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, FTX posted on its website a document entitled, “FTX’s Key Principles for Ensuring Investor Protections on Digital-Asset Platforms,” in which FTX represented that it “segregates customer assets from its own assets across our platforms.” FTX further represented in that document that it maintained “liquid assets for customer withdrawals…[to] ensure a customer without losses can redeem its assets from the platform on demand.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to making this document available to the public on its website, FTX specifically provided it to potential investors, including a U.S. investor who had invested $35 million in FTX’s Series B fundraising round in July 2021. As described above, these statements to the public, customers, and investors were false—FTX did not segregate its customer assets from its own assets, and, as events would later demonstrate, did not maintain liquidity to allow customer withdrawals on demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX investors were provided with FTX’s audited financial statements, and FTX represented in its purchase agreements that those financial statements “fairly present in all material respects the financial condition and operating results of” FTX. These audited financial statements, which do not include information about Alameda’s undocumented “line of credit” from FTX and other information discussed herein, were, at the very least, materially misleading. Indeed, FTX’s current CEO has voiced “substantial concern as to the information presented in
these audited financial statements.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the Relevant Period, Bankman-Fried made public statements assuring that customer assets were safe at FTX. For example, he stated in a tweet on or about June 27, 2022: “Backstopping customer assets should always be primary. Everything else is secondary.” He likewise tweeted on or about August 9, 2021: “As always, our users’ funds and safety comes first. We will always allow withdrawals (except in cases of suspected money laundering/theft/etc.).”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried also told investors, and directed other FTX and Alameda employees to tell investors, that Alameda received no preferential treatment from FTX. For example, Bankman-Fried told the Wall Street Journal in or around July 2022: “There are no parties that have privileged access.” Likewise, in a Bloomberg article published in or about September 2022, Bankman-Fried claimed that “Alameda is a wholly separate entity” than FTX. In the same article, Ellison is quoted as stating about Alameda: “We’re at arm’s length and don’t get any different treatment from other market makers.” Similarly, in an interview in or about August 2022, Ellison claimed that FTX and Alameda were separate companies, that Alameda received no special treatment on the FTX platform, and that there was an ethical wall between them preventing sharing of customer information between FTX and Alameda. Bankman-Fried made similar statements directly to investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants were aware of the substance of Bankman-Fried’s statements about FTX customer assets—including the security of the assets and the manner in which they would be handled—and about the relationship between Alameda and FTX. Given their involvement in the fraudulent scheme outlined herein, Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that these statements to investors were false and misleading and that they were important to FTX’s investors. Defendants further knew or were reckless in not knowing that these statements were intended to make FTX more attractive to investors and potential investors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist upperalpha">
<ol class="upperalpha" type="A" start="3">
<li>
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Defendants Knew that FTX Had Poor Controls and Deeply Inadequate Risk Management Procedures, in Stark Contrast to Bankman-Fried’s Claims that It Was a Mature, Conservative Company.</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="59">
<li>
<p>From its inception, FTX had poor controls and fundamentally deficient risk management procedures. Assets and liabilities of all forms were generally treated as interchangeable, and there were insufficient distinctions between the assignment of debts and credits to Alameda, FTX, and executives, including Bankman-Fried, Wang, and Singh. This reality was a sharp contrast to the image of FTX that Bankman-Fried consistently portrayed to the public and to investors—a mature company that managed funds and risk in a conservative, rigorous manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX invested significant resources to develop and promote its brand as a trustworthy company. For example, in materials provided to one investor in or around June 2022, FTX cultivated and promoted its reputation:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">FTX has an industry-leading brand, endorsed by some of the most trustworthy public figures, including Tom Brady, MLB, Gisele Bundchen, Steph Curry, and the Miami Heat, and backed by an industry-leading set of investors. FTX has the leanest brand in crypto.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX also promoted itself as a company that was willing to work collaboratively with regulators and lawmakers. In the same materials, FTX claimed: “FTX is also the only major digital asset venue to maintain positive, constructive relationships with regulators and lawmakers.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that the reality was far different than what Bankman-Fried presented to FTX’s investors and customers.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>The FTX Automated Risk Engine</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="63">
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried repeatedly touted FTX’s automated risk mitigation protocols— which he called FTX’s “risk engine”—to the public, and prospective investors, as a safe and reliable way for crypto asset trading platforms to manage risk. FTX engineers, led by Wang, developed the software code that created the “risk engine.” In essence, the software code implemented a series of rules that were designed to reduce risk in any individual client’s account by automatically triggering certain actions (e.g., to sell collateral in an account when an account was overly extended).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried promoted the concept of “24/7” automated risk monitoring as an innovative benefit of crypto asset markets, including at a hearing on or about December 8, 2021, to the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services, where Bankman-Fried concluded his remarks by stating:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">And the last thing I will say is if you look at what precipitated some of the 2008 financial crisis, you will see a number of bilateral, bespoke, non-reported transactions happening between financial counterparties, which then got repackaged and releveraged again and again and again, such that no one knew how much risk was in that system until it all fell apart. If you compare that to what happened on FTX or other major cryptocurrencies in use today, there is complete transparency about the full open interest. There is complete transparency about the positions that are held. There is a robust, consistent risk framework applied.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to generally promoting the benefits of automated risk engines, Bankman-Fried repeatedly claimed that FTX’s own risk engine was especially sophisticated and carefully calibrated. In a submission to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, FTX touted its automated system, claiming that it calculated a customer’s margin level every 30 seconds; and that if the collateral on deposit fell below the required margin level, FTX’s automated system would sell the customer’s portfolio assets until the collateral on deposit exceeded the required margin level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These statements were materially false and misleading because of a critical omission: Bankman-Fried did not reveal that the automatic risk engine did not apply to the accounts of its most important customer—Alameda. As discussed above, Wang and other FTX engineers—as part of Defendants’ and Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent scheme—had created a special feature in the software code to exempt Alameda from the rules of the “risk engine.” This was a critical special benefit that Bankman-Fried afforded Alameda: Alameda’s collateral on deposit was allowed to fall below FTX’s required margin level without FTX liquidating any part of Alameda’s portfolio. Ellison was aware of, and took advantage of, this special undisclosed benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Bankman-Fried’s statements regarding FTX’s risk engine misled FTX’s investors by representing that its risk engine would protect FTX customer funds and would limit FTX’s exposure to any single customer, while failing to disclose that Bankman-Fried had directed Wang to ensure that the engine not apply to one of its largest customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Bankman-Fried acknowledged in a network television interview on or about December 1, 2022: “I wasn’t even trying, like, I wasn’t spending any time or effort trying to manage risk on FTX.” Bankman-Fried continued: “What happened, happened—and, if I had been spending an hour a day thinking about risk management on FTX, I don’t think that would have happened.”</p>

<p><strong>The Valuation of Alameda’s Collateral</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="69">
<li>
<p>The collateral that Alameda had on deposit, consisting largely of enormous positions in illiquid crypto assets issued by FTX and Bankman-Fried (including the “FTT” token, the “exchange token” for FTX, as described below), compounded the undisclosed risk to FTX’s investors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Alameda Overvalued Its Collateral by Ignoring Significant Liquidity Issues.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="70">
<li>
<p>Defendants and Bankman-Fried valued the FTX-affiliated tokens at trading prices, but the collateral deposited by Alameda was not worth the value assigned to it. Alameda and FTX collectively owned the majority of these tokens, and only a small portion of the FTXaffiliated tokens were in circulation. As such, the tokens were illiquid, and, as Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing, if Alameda or FTX tried to sell Alameda’s holdings, market prices for the tokens would fall, thereby driving down the value of Alameda’s deposited collateral at FTX. As a result, even if FTX had liquidated Alameda’s portfolio, the sales of those thinly traded tokens would not have generated sufficient funds to cover the amount Alameda borrowed from FTX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants and Bankman-Fried were well aware of the impact of Alameda’s positions on FTX’s risk profile. On or about October 12, 2022, for example, Bankman-Fried, in a series of tweets, analyzed the manipulation of a digital asset on an unrelated crypto platform. In explaining what occurred, Bankman-Fried distinguished between an asset’s “current price” and its “fair price,” and recognized that “large positions – especially in illiquid tokens – can have a lot of impact.” Bankman-Fried asserted that FTX’s risk engine required customers to “fully collateralize a position” when the customer’s position is “large and illiquid enough.” But Bankman-Fried knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that by not mitigating for the impact of large and illiquid tokens posted as collateral by Alameda, FTX was engaging in precisely the same conduct, and creating the same risk, that he was warning against. Defendants too knew that Alameda was drawing down on a virtually unlimited line of credit from FTX, collateralized by what they knew or were reckless in not knowing was a large illiquid position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reality of FTX’s exposure to the risk created by the valuation of Alameda’s positions stood in stark contrast to Bankman-Fried’s assertions about risk management at FTX in his October 2022 Twitter analysis, in which he described FTX’s approach and claimed that constructing the rules for FTX’s risk engine in a manner that is “conservative, and handles apparent large moves gracefully” is “probably the most important thing we do at FTX.” Bankman-Fried further claimed, contrasting FTX to the failed endeavor: “There are a bunch of other risk engine protection and sanity checks, too, which would have caught something like this.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not only did Bankman-Fried fail to tell investors that he had exempted Alameda from FTX’s risk engine, he also falsely told certain investors that FTX had no exposure to FTT at all. In late summer 2021, for example, Bankman-Fried told a potential U.S. investor in FTX’s series B fundraising round that FTX did not hold FTT and, consequently, the investor would not have any exposure to FTT. The investor ultimately invested $30 million. For the reasons
described above, Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing that at the time that Bankman-Fried made those representations, they were false and misleading.Specifically, Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing that any investment in FTX carried significant exposure to FTT, as the token was, among other things, posted as collateral for billions of dollars that FTX had loaned to Alameda to engage in speculative investments.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="75">
<li>
<p>On or about July 29, 2019, FTX launched a crypto asset known as “FTT.” <a href="#ellison_wang_footnote_5"><strong><sup><em>(5)</em></sup></strong></a> FTX launched FTT as an “exchange token” for the FTX platform (i.e., the crypto asset or token associated with a crypto trading platform).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before launching the FTX platform in or around May 2019, FTX had minted 350 million FTT tokens in or around April 2019. Of the 350 million tokens minted, 175 million were allocated to FTX as “company tokens,” and 175 million were designated as non-company tokens. The company tokens were set to “unlock” (or become available for trading) over a threeyear period after a so-called initial exchange offering (“IEO”) of the token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the time of its offering, FTT was offered and sold as an investment contract and therefore a security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of the 175 million non-company tokens, FTX offered and sold approximately 73 million FTT in so-called “pre-sales” to investors, at prices ranging from $0.10 to $0.80. FTX raised approximately $10 million from these sales of FTT prior to the IEO. The pre-sale tokens were programmed to unlock between one to three months after the IEO. FTX did not manage separate, segregated accounts for investors, but instead pooled all proceeds from the pre-sale and the IEO of FTT and treated them interchangeably.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX used the pooled proceeds from FTT sales to fund the development, marketing, business operations, and growth of FTX, depending on the success of FTX and its management team in developing, operating, and marketing the trading platform. If demand for trading on the FTX platform increased, demand for the FTT token could increase, such that any price increase in FTT would benefit holders of FTT equally and in direct proportion to their FTT holdings. The large allocation of tokens to FTX incentivized the FTX management team to take steps to attract more users onto the trading platform and, therefore, increase demand for, and increase the trading price of, the FTT token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result of FTX and its management team’s large holdings of FTT, the interests of the company and its management team were aligned with those of investors in FTT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX’s FTT marketing materials—consisting of an FTT “whitepaper” and information posted on FTX’s website—described FTT as “the token powering the FTX ecosystem.” The publicly available information led FTT holders to reasonably expect to share in FTX’s growth and future earnings, and from appreciation in the value of FTT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FTT whitepaper specifically highlighted the profit potential of the token. For example, the whitepaper included the following statements: “We launched FTX in April and already have among the world’s most liquid orderbooks” and “[o]ur goal is to become as profitable as Bitmex and OkEx within a year.” On the FTX website, FTT purchasers were offered a 5% bonus of tokens during the first three days of the IEO if they pre-funded their FTX wallets to purchase FTT, providing a potential immediate profit to investors. FTX also represented that FTT would be listed at $1.00 on July 29, 2019, and the “pre-sales” were at prices ranging from $0.10 to $0.80, which provided purchasers an immediate profit potential based on the announced listing price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FTX whitepaper further explained: “We have carefully designed incentive schemes to increase network effects and demand for FTT, and to decrease its circulating supply.” The FTT materials stated that the token provided investors with fee rebates and discounts on FTX, and the ability to use the token as collateral for futures positions as well as for “margin trading” that FTX promised to launch “in the future.” The FTT materials referred to potential gains from FTX’s future repurchase and burning of FTT (the “buy and burn” program), to be funded by FTX’s revenues.<a href="#ellison_wang_footnote_6"><strong><sup><em>(6)</em></sup></strong></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FTX whitepaper also explained that “[c]ustomers who hold a certain amount of FTT for a period of time will receive lower FTX futures fees” and that this “will further increase demand for FTT.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTT was marketed as an investment that would appreciate in value as it grew and expanded in other ways. FTX represented that it “carefully designed incentive schemes to increase network effects and demand for FTT, and to decrease its circulating supply.” These incentives included that FTT would be listed on FTX and thus could be traded, and FTX’s “buy and burn” program would purchase FTT, thus boosting demand, and then burn those purchased tokens in order to decrease the supply of FTT and increase its price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX marketed FTT by encouraging purchasers to believe that its platform would succeed and provide a return based on that success. The FTT whitepaper emphasized “Why Invest?&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;All-Star Team,” and highlighted the importance of the management team’s experience and success in developing crypto asset trading systems. For example, the whitepaper stated that FTX’s “greatest strength lies in the team behind it” and touted FTX’s “Track Record of Proven Success” based on the background and experience of its management team. The FTT materials made clear that FTX’s core management team’s efforts would drive the growth and ultimate success of FTX. The whitepaper also advertised that certain features gave FTX an advantage over competing platforms, including industry-leading risk management systems and its liquidation engine model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX also marketed FTT as an asset that could be used in an “earn program” or in “staking programs” (i.e., a program promising interest payments on deposited assets), as additional ways in which investors could earn returns from FTT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX’s whitepaper tied the prospects of FTT’s investors to the growth of the FTX platform, and noted that FTX would undertake various “Strategies to Acquire Users and Grow Volume,” including the employment of influential spokespeople.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX’s whitepaper also stated that “[t]here are many ways FTT will be used as we add more products and features to FTX. For instance, when we launch a spot exchange in the future, FTT will be used for initial exchange offerings.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result of the above representations and the economic reality at that time, FTT investors had a reasonable expectation of profiting from FTX’s efforts to deploy investor funds to create a use for FTT and bring demand and value to their common enterprise.</p>

<p><span class="underline">Alameda and Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s Direction, Manipulated the Market Price of FTT.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="91">
<li>
<p>In July 2019, when FTX launched FTT, Alameda received a substantial portion of the 350 million FTT tokens that were minted, including all of the “company tokens” that were allocated to FTX. Alameda did not pay for these tokens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda programmed its automated trading tools (or “bots”) to conduct trades and execute transactions to purchase FTT at specific prices. On more than one occasion, Alameda and Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, actively engaged in the trading of FTT with the goal of supporting the price of the token. On these occasions, Alameda adjusted the trading parameters of its trading bots in order to support the price of FTT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, in 2019, there was downward pressure on the price of FTT as the token was being unlocked for early-stage investors. Bankman-Fried became concerned about, among other things, the psychological effect of the price of FTT dropping below a specific threshold, and instructed Ellison to have Alameda purchase FTT to support the price and avoid that outcome. In another instance in 2021, the price of FTT was again facing downward pressure from external events, this time related to substantial sales of FTT by a third party. Bankman-Fried again instructed Ellison to have Alameda purchase FTT on trading platforms to support the price. In addition, as described further below in paragraph 106, in November 2022, Ellison engaged in further deceptive conduct to support the price of FTT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By manipulating the price of FTT, Ellison and Bankman-Fried caused the valuation of Alameda’s FTT holdings to be even more inflated. As described above, Alameda’s FTT holdings were a substantial part of the collateral Alameda used to borrow funds from external lenders. By overstating the value of the collateral on Alameda’s balance sheet, Ellison and Bankman-Fried concealed Alameda’s true risk exposure from those lenders, and misled investors about FTX’s risk exposure—all in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme.</p>

<p><strong>Loans to FTX Executives and Real Estate Purchases</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="95">
<li>
<p>The FTX funds transferred to Alameda were used not only for Alameda’s proprietary trading, but also to fund loans to FTX executives, including Bankman-Fried himself, and to fund personal real estate purchases. Between March 2020 and September 2022, Bankman-Fried executed promissory notes for loans from Alameda totaling more than $1.338 billion, including two instances in which Bankman-Fried was both the borrower in his individual capacity and the lender in his capacity as CEO of Alameda. Ellison knew, or was reckless in not knowing, about these “loans.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried also used commingled funds from Alameda to make large political donations and to purchase tens of millions of dollars in Bahamian real estate for himself, his parents, and other FTX executives. Specifically, in 2020 and 2021, Wang executed promissory notes with Alameda totaling approximately $224.7 million. The funds borrowed under the promissory notes in Wang’s name were not intended for Wang’s personal use but were instead used by Bankman-Fried for other purposes, including additional venture investments. However, Wang did withdraw approximately $200,000 in funds for his own purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The loans to Bankman-Fried, Wang, and other individuals were poorly documented, and at times not documented at all. Similarly, the record keeping regarding the purchase and ownership of real estate was poorly organized and documented. Defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that neither the fact of the loans and purchases, nor the poor documentation of significant company liabilities and expenditures, was disclosed to investors.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="underline"><strong>Despite the Precarious Financial Position of FTX and Alameda, Bankman-Fried and Ellison Continued to Use FTX Customer Assets in the Summer of 2022, Including to Rescue Distressed Crypto Firms and to Further Mislead Investors.</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="98">
<li>
<p>In May 2022, the crypto markets plummeted due to a significant loss in value of certain crypto assets and networks and the collateral effects on the interrelated markets. Bankman-Fried characterized FTX, and himself, as playing an important role in stabilizing the industry. Bankman-Fried entered into a series of transactions with other members of  the industry, providing credit to and taking over other failing firms. On or about June 21, 2022, after giving a $250 million line of revolving credit to BlockFi, a global crypto financial services company, to provide the company with access to capital to ease liquidity concerns, Bankman-Fried tweeted: “We take our duty seriously to protect the digital asset ecosystem and its customers.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time that Bankman-Fried was positioning himself as a hero in the industry, however, the plummeting value of crypto assets was impacting Alameda, and as a result impacting FTX. As discussed above, as a result of the same market conditions impacting BlockFi’s liquidity, many of Alameda’s lenders demanded repayment of loans they had made to
Alameda. Ellison, at the direction of Bankman-Fried, drew down billions of dollars from its “line of credit” from FTX to repay some of Alameda’s loans—money that came from FTX’s spot market funded by FTX customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, in the summer of 2022, Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that FTX was in a precarious financial condition. However, Bankman-Fried and Ellison, with Wang’s knowledge, continued to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase and support other crypto companies, and allowed Alameda to use FTX customer funds
to repay its debts. In addition, Bankman-Fried, Wang, and other FTX executives continued to withdraw customer funds in the form of the poorly documented and undisclosed “loans” described above. Specifically, on or about July 22, 2022, Bankman-Fried loaned himself $136 million and, on or about September 28, 2022, Wang signed a promissory note to Alameda for $13.7 million, which was used by Bankman-Fried for a venture investment. Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew, or were reckless in not knowing, of the significant financial risk these “loans” posed to both Alameda and FTX. Collectively, Defendants’ and Bankman-Fried’s actions in the summer of 2022 further imperiled FTX’s financial condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that Bankman-Fried continued to present a false and misleading positive account of FTX to investors, despite FTX’s tenuous financial condition at this time. In a meeting with FTX’s U.S. investors in September 2022, for example, an FTX presentation included the claim that: “Outside of BlockFi, we didn’t increase our exposure to crypto.” This statement was false and misleading: the customer funds that FTX diverted to Alameda, including customer funds that Ellison used to repay Alameda’s lenders, were collateralized in part by Alameda’s FTT holdings. Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing that, as a result, FTX’s exposure to crypto, including its own FTT token, increased substantially as Alameda increased its borrowing, backed by FTT as collateral, in the second quarter of 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In that same meeting with FTX investors, FTX also represented that certain investments did not involve the assets of FTX or its customers. Contrary to that representation, two $100 million investments made by FTX’s affiliated investment vehicle, FTX Ventures Ltd., were funded with FTX customer funds that had been diverted to Alameda.</p>

<p><span class="underline"><strong>Even as the Scheme Was Spiraling Out of Control, Bankman-Fried and Ellison, with Wang’s Knowledge, Continued to Mislead Investors and the Public About FTX’s True Financial Condition.</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic text-justify">
<ol class="arabic" start="103">
<li>
<p>On or about November 2, 2022, CoinDesk, a crypto news website, published an
article stating that based on its review of an Alameda balance sheet it had obtained, Alameda
held a large position in FTT and other FTX-associated tokens. At Bankman-Fried’s direction,
Ellison responded on Twitter to reassure investors and the public that Alameda was financially
sound. Ellison did so on or about November 6, 2022, tweeting that the balance sheet referenced
in the CoinDesk article (and elsewhere by that point) “is for a subset of our corporate entities, we
have &gt; $10 billion of assets that aren’t reflected there.” Ellison continued: “…given the
tightening in the crypto credit space this year we’ve returned most of our loans by now.” The
tweet was designed to provide false reassurance to customers by implying that Alameda had
additional assets that meant its financial condition was stronger than the balance sheet suggested.
At the same time, the tweet omitted the fact that the balance sheet did not accurately reflect the
significant debt that Alameda owed to FTX. In contrast to the positive message in her tweet, at
that point, Ellison knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Alameda was insolvent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On or about November 6, 2022, the CEO of Binance, a crypto asset trading
platform, announced that “[d]ue to recent revelations that have came [sic] to light,” Binance
would liquidate its FTT holdings. Binance held FTT then valued at more than $500 million,
which it had received from FTX as part of Bankman-Fried’s buyout of Binance’s equity in FTX
as an early round investor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Binance’s announcement caused many FTX customers to withdraw their funds
from FTX. Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing that given
Alameda’s large FTT holdings, any further drop in the value of FTT threatened the solvency of
FTX, given Alameda’s multi-billion-dollar liabilities. With the knowledge and consent of the
Defendants, Bankman-Fried engaged in a frantic campaign to prevent this outcome by assuring
investors and the public that FTX was financially sound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specifically, to prevent a collapse in the market price of FTT that Binance’s sales
might cause, Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, tweeted an offer to buy Binance’s entire
stake, for $22 per token (“@cz_binance if you’re looking to minimize the market impact on your
FTT sales, Alameda will happily buy it all from you today at $22!”). When Ellison sent this
message she knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that in order for Alameda to be able to
actually purchase Binance’s FTT for $22 per token, Alameda would have to draw down
additional funds from FTX itself, further extending its line of credit, or obtain funds from thirdparty
lenders without disclosing its own tenuous financial condition. Despite this, Ellison posted
the tweet in an effort to support and increase the price of FTT, again using Alameda to impact
the price of FTT in furtherance of Defendants’ scheme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, attempting to maintain public and investor confidence in FTX,
Bankman-Fried tweeted on or about November 7, 2022: “FTX is fine. Assets are fine … FTX
has enough to cover all client holdings. We don’t invest client assets (even in treasuries). We
have been processing all withdrawals, and will continue to be ….” That tweet was false and
misleading, and Bankman-Fried later deleted it. Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew that FTX,
at Bankman-Fried’s direction, had allowed Alameda to invest “client assets” and that Alameda
had in fact done so, using FTX customer funds to make investments far riskier than “treasuries.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next day, November 8, 2022, FTX paused all customer withdrawals, and the
price of FTT plummeted by approximately 80%. Alameda’s collateral on deposit was worth far
less than the amount Alameda had borrowed from FTX. FTX was left with billions of dollars in
effectively unrecoverable loans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facing a solvency crisis, Bankman-Fried searched for investors who could
provide additional funding. On or about November 8, 2022, the CEO of Binance tweeted: “FTX
asked for our help. There is a significant liquidity crunch. To protect users, we signed a nonbinding
LOI, intending to fully acquire <a href="http://FTX.com" class="bare">http://FTX.com</a> and help cover the liquidity crunch. We
will be conducting a full DD [due diligence] in the coming days.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It only took one day, however, for Binance to decide not to acquire FTX. On or
about November 9, Binance announced: “As a result of corporate due diligence, as well as the
latest news reports regarding mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations,
we have decided that we will not pursue the potential acquisition of <a href="http://FTX.com.”" class="bare">http://FTX.com.”</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX customers withdrew approximately $5 billion from the platform that day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, Bankman-Fried sought emergency funding from other
investors, including U.S. investors, to cover a shortfall at FTX of approximately $8 billion. As
part of this effort, Bankman-Fried circulated a balance sheet to potential investors that listed a
negative $8 billion entry labeled as a “hidden, poorly internally labeled ‘fiat@ account.’” This
entry was a reference to the above-described <a href="mailto:fiat@ftx.com">fiat@ftx.com</a> account and reflected FTX customer
funds deposited in Alameda’s bank accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During a meeting with Alameda employees on or about November 9, 2022,
Ellison admitted that she, Bankman-Fried, Wang, and Singh were aware that FTX customer
funds had been used by Alameda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the morning of November 10, 2022, confronting the implosion of FTX and
Alameda, Bankman-Fried tweeted: “1) I’m sorry. That’s the biggest thing. I f*cked up, and
should have done better.”<a href="#ellison_wang_footnote_7"><strong><sup><em>(7)</em></sup></strong></a> In the same tweet thread, Bankman-Fried announced that Alameda was “winding down trading” and soon would not trade on FTX at all. Bankman-Fried
maintained that “FTX International currently has a total market value of assets/collateral higher
than client deposits (moves with prices!).” And he stated, among other things, that he was trying
to “raise liquidity,” claiming “[t]here are a number of players who we are in talks with, LOIs
[letters of intent], term sheets, etc.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next day, November 11, 2022, Bankman-Fried resigned from FTX. Shortly thereafter, FTX and approximately 100 affiliated entities, including FTX US, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Wang’s employment with FTX and Ellison’s employment with Alameda were terminated on or about November 18, 2022.</p>

<p>Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC” or “Commission”), by and through its undersigned attorneys, hereby alleges as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist upperroman text-center">
<ol class="upperroman" type="I">
<li>
<p><span class="underline"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric text-justify">
<ol class="numeric">
<li>
<p>Samuel Bankman-Fried (“Bankman-Fried”), along with Zixiao “Gary” Wang (“Wang”) and others, co-founded Alameda Research LLC (“Alameda”), a digital asset trading and investment firm, in Berkeley, California in 2017. In or around May 2019, Bankman-Fried, Wang and others launched FTX Trading Ltd. d/b/a FTX.com (“FTX Trading”) and various subsidiaries, affiliates and related entities, collectively doing business as “FTX.com” or simply “FTX,” operating a centralized digital asset exchange. In or around October 2021, Bankman-Fried appointed Caroline Ellison (“Ellison”) to serve as a co-Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Alameda, and later as sole CEO. (These parties are collectively referred to as “Defendants”). Alameda and FTX were large and well-known players in the digital asset industry, and Bankman-Fried was their young, high-profile owner and leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At its peak, the daily trading volume on FTX was over $20 billion, and it had garnered a $32 billion valuation. FTX had prominent paid sponsorships, including the naming rights to a professional sports arena in Miami, celebrity endorsements and a 2022 Super Bowl commercial that touted FTX as “the safest and easiest way to buy and sell crypto.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On November 11, 2022, Bankman-Fried’s empire abruptly collapsed. FTX customers and the world at large discovered that FTX, through its sister-company Alameda, had been surreptitiously siphoning off customer assets for its own use—and over $8 billion in customer assets were now missing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning no later than May 2019 and continuing through at least November 11, 2022 (the “Relevant Period”), Bankman-Fried owned, operated and/or controlled FTX Trading, along with its numerous subsidiaries and related entities around the world, all doing business as FTX.com or FTX. He also owned, operated and/or controlled Alameda and its various subsidiaries and related entities, as well as numerous other related entities in the digital asset industry. Throughout the Relevant Period, Alameda operated as a primary “market maker” on FTX, providing liquidity to its various digital asset markets and also performed a number of other key functions for the exchange. Bankman-Fried, along with Wang, Ellison and/or others, operated Defendant entities, together with other entities under Bankman-Fried’s majority ownership and control, as a common enterprise (referred to herein as the “FTX Enterprise”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the Relevant Period, and unbeknownst to all but a small circle of insiders, including Bankman-Fried, Ellison and Wang, FTX customers deposits, including fiat currency and digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and tether (USDT), each a commodity in interstate commerce, that were intended to be used for trading or custodied on FTX, were regularly accepted, held by and/or misappropriated by Alameda for its own use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At Bankman-Fried’s direction, FTX executives including Wang created features in the underlying code for FTX that allowed Alameda to maintain an essentially unlimited line of credit on FTX. At Bankman-Fried’s direction, FTX executives including Wang also created other exceptions to FTX’s standard processes that allowed Alameda to have an unfair advantage when transacting on the platform, such as quicker execution times and an exemption from the platform’s publicly-touted auto-liquidation risk management process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the Relevant Period, at the direction of Bankman-Fried, Ellison and others, Alameda used FTX assets, including customer assets, to trade on other digital asset exchanges and to fund a variety of high-risk digital asset industry investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives also took hundreds of millions of dollars in poorly-documented “loans” from Alameda that they used to purchase luxury real estate and property for themselves and/or family members, make political donations and for other unauthorized uses. These unauthorized uses of customer assets were not disclosed to or known by FTX customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the Relevant Period, Defendants, through a web of subsidiaries, affiliates and other related entities collectively constituting the FTX Enterprise, misappropriated customer assets for their own use and benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite this, FTX represented, in its Terms of Service and elsewhere, that customers were the “owner[s]” of all assets in their accounts, had “control” over the assets at all times, and that those assets were “appropriately safeguarded and segregated” from FTX’s own assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through this conduct and the conduct further described herein, Defendants violated Section 6(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act” or “CEA”), 7 U.S.C. § 9(1), and Commission Regulation (“Regulation”) 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. §180.1(a) (2021). Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants are likely to continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Amended Complaint and similar acts and practices, as more fully described below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accordingly, the CFTC brings this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-l, to enjoin Defendants’ unlawful acts and practices and to compel their compliance with the Act. In addition, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties and remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans, disgorgement, restitution, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court may deem necessary and appropriate.</p>

<p><span class="underline"><strong>Founding of Alameda and the FTX Exchange</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric text-justify">
<ol class="numeric" start="29">
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried, Wang and others co-founded Alameda in November 2017 in Berkeley, California. Initially, Alameda primarily engaged in high-frequency digital asset arbitrage trading. This practice consisted of using proprietary algorithmic quantitative computer programs, commonly known as “bots,” to identify arbitrage opportunities due to price differentials between various digital asset platforms. Alameda engaged in high-frequency arbitrage trading across a large variety of digital asset exchanges, including certain exchanges operating in the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a June 29, 2019 “white paper,” Alameda represented that within a year of its inception, it had “become the largest liquidity provider and market maker in the [digital asset] space,” trading “$600 million to 1 billion a day” and accounting for “roughly 5% of global volume in digital asset trading.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the Relevant Period, Bankman-Fried has owned 90% of Alameda and Wang owned 10%. Bankman-Fried was CEO of Alameda until October 2021, at which time he selected and appointed Ellison and another individual as co-CEOs to replace him. Ellison assumed the position of sole CEO of Alameda in August 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even after stepping down as CEO of Alameda, Bankman-Fried continued to maintain control over Alameda. For example, Bankman-Fried remained a signatory on Alameda Research’s bank accounts and an authorized trader for Alameda’s accounts with CFTC registered futures commission merchants. Bankman-Fried also maintained direct decision-making authority over all of Alameda’s major trading, investment and financial decisions. This authority was exercised at least in part through Bankman-Fried’s regular, often daily, participation in various in-person and mobile chat communications with Ellison and other senior personnel at Alameda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over time, Alameda expanded its activities into a number of new digital asset business models, including making large equity investments in various companies in the digital asset industry, including by securing large loans from digital asset lending platforms to enable it to increase the size and variety of its digital asset industry investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By late 2018, Bankman-Fried, Wang and others employed at Alameda’s offices in Berkeley, California had begun building the centralized digital asset derivatives exchange that would ultimately become FTX. Wang and developers working with Wang were primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the code underlying FTX.com (i.e. the computer programming rules that direct the function of the FTX platform). FTX development was funded, in part, by another digital asset exchange, Binance, which, upon information and belief, had acquired an approximately 20% stake in FTX in or before November 2019.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In early 2019, Bankman-Fried, Wang and others moved to Hong Kong to finalize and launch the FTX platform to the public. The FTX.com website was launched and made available to the public by no later than May 2019. Bankman-Fried was at all times during the Relevant Period the majority shareholder of FTX and related entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX offered trading in a large variety of digital assets, including digital asset commodities such as bitcoin, ether, tether and others. FTX operated primarily as a derivatives exchange and offered trading in various types of options, futures, swaps, “perpetual futures” and other digital asset commodity derivative products. FTX allowed customers to place buy (long) and sell (short) orders in an electronic order book and matched customer orders via its “trading engine” or “matching engine.” FTX also offered a number of additional services related to the trading of digital asset products. For example, FTX operated a peer-to-peer (P2P) margin lending program where customers could offer margined and leveraged offerings to one another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customers could access the FTX platform through the FTX.com website, through a mobile application and through an Application Programming Interface (API). FTX also offered an off-exchange “over the counter” (OTC) portal that enabled customers to connect and request quotes for spot digital assets and trade directly, rather than placing resting orders on a central limit order book. Wang and developers working with Wang were primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the code underlying the FTX API and OTC portal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In marketing materials and in communications with federal regulators and others, FTX touted its auto-liquidation risk management engine, cross-margin functionality and backstop liquidity provider (“BLP”) programs as unique features that limited risk. Wang and developers working with Wang were primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the code underlying these features of FTX. Alameda was a leading participant in the BLP program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX relied on Alameda resources, assets and personnel to carry out a number of core functions for the FTX platform, including creating liquid submarkets for all of the products offered on FTX, maintaining an appropriate balance of various digital assets on the exchange and supporting the “peer to peer” margin lending program. Alameda likewise relied on various FTX resources, assets and personnel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX grew quickly. By June 2019, for example, just months after its launch, according to FTX, the daily volume of futures trading on FTX often exceeded $100 million. Beginning no later than 2020, FTX was consistently ranked as one of largest digital asset exchanges in the world by trading volume. In 2021, according to FTX, FTX entities held approximately $15 billion in assets on their platforms, accounted for approximately 10% of global digital asset volumes and transacted $16 billion of volume per day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because of the perception of potential conflicts of interest between FTX and Alameda, Defendants and their employees understood that it was important to present a public perception that there was strong separation between Alameda and FTX. On information and belief, this was one key motivation for Bankman-Fried’s resignation as CEO of Alameda. Bankman-Fried, Ellison and others also reinforced a separate spheres narrative in their public statements. For example, during an August 2022 media appearance, Ellison, in her capacity as CEO of Alameda, said the following about the nature of the relationship between FTX and Alameda:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">They’re both owned by Sam [Bankman-Fried], obviously. So ultimately, sort of aligned incentives in that way. We keep them quite separate in terms of day-to-day operations. We definitely have a Chinese wall in terms of information sharing to ensure that no one in Alameda would get customer information from FTX or anything like that, or any sort of special treatment from FTX. They really take that pretty seriously.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such public representations by and on behalf of Defendants did not reflect reality. Throughout the Relevant Period, Alameda and FTX continued to share office space, first in Berkeley, California and later in Hong Kong and the Bahamas. They also shared key personnel, technology and hardware, intellectual property and other resources. Bankman-Fried, Wang, Ellison and other senior management at Alameda and FTX also had widespread access to each other’s systems and accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In January 2020, Bankman-Fried, Wang and others established a separate group of operating entities operating a digital asset exchange specifically for U.S. persons. These entities collectively did business as “FTX US” and were incorporated primarily in the State of Delaware. The FTX US entities also held various registrations, including as a licensed Money Transmitter under the laws of the State of South Dakota. FTX US offered trading to U.S. persons in a large number of digital assets, including, but not limited to, spot digital asset commodities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In October 2021, FTX US acquired a commodity derivatives company called LedgerX LLC, which then began doing business as “FTX US Derivatives.” FTX US Derivatives operated as a CFTC-registered Designated Contract Market (“DCM”), Derivatives Clearing Organization (“DCO”) and Swap Execution Facility (“SEF”). FTX US Derivatives maintained separate bank accounts and, upon information and belief, appropriately segregated and accounted for customer assets at all relevant times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the Relevant Period, FTX purported to block U.S.-based customers from using its exchange to transact in digital asset products and to instead direct those U.S. customers to transact exclusively through the FTX US and FTX US Derivatives entities. On information and belief, some U.S. persons and entities were able to use FTX to transact in digital assets, including digital asset commodity products, futures, options, swaps, “ perpetual futures” and derivatives.</p>

<p><span class="underline"><strong>FTX and Alameda Commingled, Mishandled and Misappropriated FTX Customer Assets from the Moment of FTX’s Launch</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric text-justify">
<ol class="numeric" start="46">
<li>
<p>At the time Bankman-Fried, Wang and others launched FTX, FTX did not establish the requisite bank accounts to accept and hold customer assets. Instead, customers seeking to deposit “fiat” currency (i.e. traditional government-issued currency) into their FTX accounts were directed to wire their fiat deposits to bank accounts that were owned and controlled by Alameda. Some or all of those bank accounts were opened in the name of an entity called North Dimension, a Delaware-registered wholly-owned subsidiary of Alameda that, on information and belief, deliberately did not have a name that was readily-identifiable with Alameda. Certain of these bank accounts were located and based in the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once received, FTX customer assets were not segregated from Alameda assets or placed into accounts designated as being “for the benefit of” (FBO) FTX customers. When FTX customer assets were deposited into Alameda bank accounts, Alameda personnel manually credited FTX customer accounts with the corresponding amount of fiat currency on FTX internal ledger system. Customers accessing their FTX accounts would be able to observe on the exchange’s website (and later mobile application) that their deposits had been posted to their FTX accounts, even though the fiat deposits actually remained in Alameda-controlled bank accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a small subset of customer deposits, Alameda exchanged customer deposits for fiat-backed stablecoins such as USDC and USDT (which are generally understood to be pegged 1:1 to and backed 1:1 by U.S. Dollars) and then transferred an equivalent amount of such stablecoins to FTX’s digital asset wallets. Alameda treated fiat currency and stablecoins as fungible and this was the designated method for crediting customer accounts for fiat bank deposits. While this happened occasionally, customer assets typically remained solely in bank accounts in the name of Alameda, where they continued to be commingled with Alameda’s own assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Alameda-owned bank accounts holding FTX customer fiat assets were collectively reflected on FTX’s internal ledger systems as the “fiat@ftx” account. During the Relevant Period, this account held a balance of as much as $8 billion in customer assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By approximately August 2020, FTX had opened its own FBO fiat bank accounts. However, FTX customer assets that had previously been wired to Alameda and reflected in the “fiat@ftx” group of Alameda bank accounts were not transferred to FTX’s bank accounts. Furthermore, even after August 2020, at least some FTX customers continued to send fiat deposits to Alameda-owned accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consistently from the launch of FTX and throughout the Relevant Period, Alameda accessed and used FTX customer assets for Alameda’s own operations and activities, including to fund its trading, investment and borrowing/lending activities. Alameda’s use of FTX customer assets included both customer fiat deposits that were sent to Alameda-owned bank accounts and customer digital asset deposits and holdings that Alameda accessed via the unbounded withdrawal capabilities of its FTX account.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric text-justify">
<ol class="numeric" start="52">
<li>
<p>The use of customer assets by Alameda was not authorized by FTX customers, and FTX customers were not made aware that their assets were being used by Alameda. To the contrary, FTX’s Terms of Service expressly prohibited such use of customer assets. Specifically, Section 8.2.6 of the FTX Trading Terms of Service states:<br/>
All Digital Assets are held in your Account on the following basis:</p>
<div class="olist upperalpha">
<ol class="upperalpha" type="A">
<li>
<p>Title to your Digital Assets shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to FTX Trading. As the owner of Digital Assets in your Account, you shall bear all risk of loss of such Digital Assets. FTX Trading shall have no liability for fluctuations in the fiat currency value of Digital Assets held in your Account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>None of the Digital Assets in your Account are the property of, or shall or may be loaned to, FTX Trading; FTX Trading does not represent or treat Digital Assets in User’s Accounts as belonging to FTX Trading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You control the Digital Assets held in your Account. At any time, subject to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies (including the Terms), you may withdraw your Digital Assets by sending them to a different blockchain address controlled by you or a third party.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants were aware of the need to segregate and protect customer assets. In fact, FTX developed internal policy documents relating to the protection of customer assets. For example, in an FTX Digital Markets (“FDM”) policy document entitled “Safeguarding of Assets &amp; Digital Token Management Policy” dated August 2021, this affiliated entity of FTX Trading indicated that:<br/>
FDM has a responsibility to ensure that customer assets are appropriately safeguarded and segregated from its own funds. This includes customer assets that may be held by third party service providers. FDM will ensure that:</p>
<div class="ulist disc">
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p>Customer assets (both fiat and virtual assets) are segregated from its own assets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer assets (both fiat and virtual assets) will be clearly designated and easily identifiable;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All third-party service providers are aware that customer funds do not represent property of FDM and are therefore protected from third-party creditors; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All third-party providers are aware that customer assets are held in trust.<br/>
Regarding customer fiat assets, FDM will maintain customer accounts with a regulated credit, e-money or payment institution that is acceptable to the Securities Commission of The Bahamas (SCB). Customer accounts will be designated as such, and the monies contained therein will be appropriately ring-fenced and protected from claims against FDM.
Customer monies will be appropriately ring-fenced to protect from:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The unlikely event FDM becomes insolvent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of customer monies being used to benefit others; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FDM using customer monies to finance its own operations.<br/>
Written notice will be provided to the relevant regulated credit, e-money, or payment institution to clarify that the assets contained are held by us on trust for our customers and they are not entitled to combine the account any other account, or to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim against the money in those accounts, in respect of any debt owed by us.<br/>
All customer accounts will be under the dual signatory of two directors or of one director, together with a senior member of the management team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the Relevant Period, Bankman-Fried and other representatives of FTX consistently and repeatedly reiterated, in a variety of contexts, that customer assets were properly segregated and custodied by FTX at all times, in conformance with both FTX’s Terms of Service and generally understood best practices for derivatives exchanges, which presume a requirement for customer disclosure and consent in order to engage in rehypothecation of customer assets (i.e. re-use of deposited assets).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such statements about the treatment and custody of customer assets include misstatements that Bankman-Fried and others made and/or caused to be made to the U.S. Congress, the CFTC and/or other federal and state government agencies, investors and in public venues such as Twitter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, during February 9, 2022 testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, Bankman-Fried, while advocating for the implementation of legislation regarding digital assets and the extension of certain legal protections to digital asset exchanges, testified as follows with respect to FTX’s treatment of customer assets:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">FTX has policies and procedures for its platforms today that reflect this basic principle by maintaining liquid assets for customers withdrawals, including a sufficient balance of digital assets funded by the company for its non-U.S. platform. The resources are funded to provide sufficient cover against user losses under certain events and extreme scenarios in order to, among other purposes, ensure a customer without losses can redeem its assets from the platform on demand.<br/>
[…]<br/>
In keeping with this principle, FTX provides a user experience that enables any user to easily view account balances for all assets, for all of its platforms, in real time. By logging in to the customer’s account at FTX, the
customer can immediately view the types of assets they own held in custody by FTX. The assets are ledgered and easily identifiable to the user (but held in an omnibus wallet in the case of the customer’s tokens in order to better promote liquidity on the platform) pursuant to internal policies and procedures, and FTX regularly reconciles customers’ trading balances against cash and digital assets held by FTX. Additionally, as a general principle FTX segregates customer assets from its own assets across our platforms.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contrary to such representations and without disclosure to FTX customers, Alameda and FTX commingled assets and freely used FTX customer assets as if they were their own, including as capital to deploy in their own trading and investment activities. On information and belief, Bankman-Fried, his parents and other FTX and Alameda employees used FTX customer assets for a variety of personal expenditures, including luxury real estate purchases, private jets, documented and undocumented personal loans and personal political donations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On information and belief, commingled assets, including FTX customer assets, were also furtively used by Bankman-Fried and FTX for extensive marketing and promotional expenses in the United States, including a Super Bowl commercial and the sponsorship of a sports stadium in Miami, Florida. Many of these advertisements, including the Super Bowl commercial, touted FTX as “the safest and easiest way to buy and sell crypto.” These promotional activities were carried out in the United States to generally promote “FTX” rather than specifically “FTX US.” On information and belief, some of these promotional activities were paid for or guaranteed by FTX Trading entities.</p>

<li>
<p><span class="underline"><strong>Alameda’s Relationship with and Special Privileges on FTX</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric text-justify">
<ol class="numeric" start="59">
<li>
<p>From the launch of FTX, Alameda operated as a primary market maker on FTX. In that capacity, Alameda acted as an always-available buyer and seller of digital assets in order to provide sufficient liquidity and an available trading counterparty to FTX customers. Over time, FTX acquired additional institutional market makers, but Alameda remained a high-volume market maker throughout the Relevant Period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda also performed a number of other functions for FTX throughout the Relevant Period. For example, Alameda helped FTX maintain an acceptable balance of various digital assets and particularly stablecoins, in its wallets. To do so, Alameda was authorized to make large exchanges of various stablecoins on behalf of FTX, using FTX’s assets rather than its own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda enjoyed certain essential and undisclosed benefits and privileges on FTX throughout the Relevant Period. These advantages were programmed into the code for FTX by Wang and others at the direction of Bankman-Fried. For one, Alameda was exempt from FTX’s “auto-liquidation” risk engine functions, which would automatically liquidate (sell) a customer’s open position when their “Maintenance Margin Fraction” fell below a certain determined level. All customers who took on too much leverage or risk on FTX would thus be auto-liquidated by the exchange. Alameda was exempt from this—it could not be liquidated on FTX under any conditions. This exception was hard coded into FTX’s system. This advantage was not publicly disclosed during the Relevant Period. The existence of this and other advantages directly contradicted public statements made by and on behalf of Defendants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda’s account on FTX also had a special designation in the FTX code throughout the Relevant Period, labeled as an “allow negative flag,” which allowed Alameda to execute a transaction even if it did not have the assets available in its account to do so. This flag was implemented by an FTX executive at the direction of Bankman-Fried and with Wang’s knowledge. At Bankman-Fried’s direction, Alameda also had an essentially unbounded credit limit in the FTX database. On at least one occasion during the Relevant Period, Alameda had reached a previously-set borrowing limit for its FTX account. In response, Bankman-Fried directed Wang and/or other FTX executives to raise the borrowing limit to a level that would be unlikely to ever be exceeded. On information and belief, FTX executives ultimately raised Alameda’s borrowing limit to be many tens of billions of dollars. Alameda’s borrowed assets could also be withdrawn from FTX. These features, in combination, allowed Alameda unlimited ability to borrow and withdraw digital assets directly from FTX to put towards its off-platform activities. This functionality existed separate and apart from Alameda’s more limited participation in FTX’s P2P margin lending program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda’s ability to withdraw unlimited assets from FTX was not publicly disclosed during the Relevant Period. On information and belief, Defendants were aware of and responsible for these functionalities throughout the Relevant Period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda also enjoyed order execution timing privileges for its transactions on FTX throughout the Relevant Period. Alameda, like many other institutional customers, transacted on FTX through the API rather than the standard front-end website or mobile application. However, while most or all other customers of API had their transaction orders routed through the FTX system, Alameda was able to bypass certain portions of the system and gain faster access to the API. As a result, Alameda’s transaction orders were received several milliseconds faster than those of other API users. In the high-frequency trading sector, this is a significant time advantage. This was not publicly disclosed during the Relevant Period. On information and belief, Defendants were aware of and/or responsible for these functionalities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda also enjoyed an additional execution time privilege during the Relevant Period as a result of not being subject to certain automated verification processes, because the above features of its account made it unnecessary to carry out certain automated steps like verifying available assets before executing a transaction. Other FTX customers, in contrast, were subject to an automated review process when placing orders to ensure that they had sufficient assets in their accounts to execute the requested transaction. By avoiding this “account API lock” process, Alameda gained another significant speed advantage. Similarly, if other customers placed several orders at once, these checks occurred in sequential order, so that each transaction could be confirmed as viable. This did not apply to the Alameda account on FTX. These advantages were not publicly disclosed during the Relevant Period. On information and belief, Defendants were aware of and/or responsible for these functionalities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defendants were aware of and participated in facilitating the foregoing privileges afforded to Alameda, both with respect to Alameda’s advantages in its activity on FTX and with respect to Alameda’s ability to withdraw and misappropriate FTX customer assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the direction and/or under the control of Bankman-Fried and Ellison, Alameda used large amounts of capital, including capital derived from FTX customer assets, to undertake significant illiquid investments and transactions, including long-term equity holdings in a variety of digital asset companies and large acquisitions of relatively illiquid digital assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of Alameda’s most significant holdings was the FTX Token (“FTT”) digital asset. FTT was the FTX “exchange token” and could be used to obtain discounted trading fees for transactions on FTX. On information and belief, Alameda did not pay to acquire its FTT holdings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTX consistently used one third of the trading revenues it collected to buy FTT tokens in the marketplace and “burn” them—a mechanism to permanently take the tokens out of circulation by sending them to a smart wallet from which they could never be withdrawn. On a weekly basis, FTX announced on Twitter the quantity of FTT it had bought and burned that week. On information and belief, this was intended to raise the value of the FTT tokens that remained in circulation, and thereby the value of the FTT that Alameda held.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda’s FTT holdings were a significant portion of its balance sheet and a significant portion of all FTT in circulation. Alameda valued its FTT holdings on its balance sheet at the market price at which FTT was traded, without applying any discount to reflect that it could not have sold its significant FTT holdings into the marketplace without causing a sharp reduction in its trading price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda also held extremely large quantities of several other illiquid digital assets relative to their circulation volumes, and likewise did not apply a discount to the value of those holdings on its balance sheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alameda relied on its significant holdings of FTT and similar illiquid tokens, valued at the market value of the asset without discount, as collateral to support a number of large loans from various digital asset lending platforms. During the Relevant Period, Alameda took out a large number of loans, at times totaling as much as $10 billion in notional value.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric text-justify">
<ol class="numeric" start="73">
<li>
<p>By early 2022, Alameda had invested several billion dollars in directional, unhedged, illiquid and/or long-term investments. To fund these investment activities, Alameda relied on billions of dollars of loans from digital asset lending platforms, traditional bank lines of credit and its unlimited borrowing abilities on FTX, including its access to customer assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In approximately spring 2022, the digital asset markets as a whole experienced a significant downturn. This downturn came to a head in May 2022 with the crash of two significant and widely-traded digital assets, whose value crashed essentially to zero. There was significant contagion from this event, including a major decline in the value of bitcoin, ether and other digital assets. The devaluation of such central and high-volume digital assets resulted in major credit defaults throughout the digital asset industry, as the value of collateral guaranteeing various loans declined. As a result, a number of digital asset lenders and market participants made margin calls on borrowers, liquidated open positions, recalled loans and/or collapsed entirely, including into bankruptcy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In approximately May and/or June 2022, Alameda was subject to a large number of such margin calls and loan recalls. It did not have sufficient liquid assets to service its loans. Instead, at the direction and/or under the supervision of Bankman-Fried and Ellison, Alameda greatly increased its usage of FTX customer assets to meet its external debt obligations. Alameda was able to rely on its undisclosed ordinary-course access to FTX credit and customer assets to facilitate these large withdrawals, which were several billion dollars in notional value. Defendants were aware of and/or responsible for this misappropriation of FTX customer assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By approximately mid-2022, FTX’s internal ledgers reflected that the balance of Alameda’s fiat liability to FTX totaled approximately $8 billion, a staggering amount that exceeded FTX total lifetime revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publicly during this time, Defendants’ public statements falsely portrayed that FTX and Alameda remained highly profitable and liquid. Following the market crash of May 2022, Bankman-Fried, through Alameda and other entities, bailed out several digital asset companies with loans or acquisitions. Bankman-Fried portrayed these activities as benevolent and for the benefit of the digital asset industry. In connection with the acquisition of one such digital asset lending platform from a bankruptcy sale, on October 2, 2022 Bankman-Fried tweeted that “our bids are generally determined by fair market price, no discounts; goal isn’t to make money buying assets at cents on the dollar, it’s to pay $1 on the $1 and get the $1 back to customers.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On information and belief, Bankman-Fried stated privately that he was pursuing an aggressive acquisition strategy during this time at least in part to gain access to additional sources of capital that could be used to support his existing businesses and fill the hole in customer assets that had been created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried had acknowledged this large outstanding balance to a small group of key personnel of FTX and Alameda, including Ellison and Wang, throughout the Relevant Period. In one such conversation, Bankman-Fried indicated to an FTX executive that he was not concerned with Alameda’s liability on FTX.com because it was sufficiently collateralized by Alameda’s holdings of FTT tokens—the same tokens whose market price Alameda’s trading desk was actively trying to control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least in part to remediate the risk that Alameda’s large liability would be discovered, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, FTX executives reallocated Alameda’s approximately $8 billion in liabilities to a customer account on FTX’s systems that Bankman-Fried would later refer to as “our Korean friend’s account” and/or “the weird Korean account.” This was technically a sub-account of Alameda, but unlike other Alameda sub-accounts on FTX, it was not opened under an “@alameda-research.com” identifier and was not otherwise readily identifiable as being an Alameda-associated account. The system notes associated with the account described it as “FTX fiat old.” As a result, it was no longer apparent on FTX’s ledgers that Alameda had an $8 billion negative balance on its FTX account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same type of “allow negative flag” and exemption from liquidation characteristics were applied to the so-called Korean account as was applicable to the Alameda main account and other sub-accounts.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric text-justify">
<ol class="numeric" start="82">
<li>
<p>In or around September 2022, Bankman-Fried drafted and shared a document that questioned whether Alameda should be permanently shut down. The document, titled “We came, we saw, we researched” began: “I only started thinking about this today, and so haven’t vetted it much yet. But: I think it might be time for Alameda Research to shut down. Honestly, it was probably time to do that a year ago.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried went on to lay out a number of reasons for the suggestion to shut down Alameda, including “[t]he fact that we didn’t hedge as much as we should have alone cost more in EV [expected value] than all the money Alameda has ever made or ever will make”; “[i]n the current environment, capital is really expensive, and Alameda doesn’t justify it”; and “Alameda is making some money trading, but not enough to justify its existence[.]” These admissions were directly contrary to contemporaneous public statements that Bankman-Fried and Alameda were making regarding Alameda’s profitability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried also laid out a number of “large downsides” to shutting down Alameda, including those that reflected the interconnectedness between Alameda and FTX’s operations such as “[l]ess liquidity on FTX” and the observation that “given the amount that Alameda is doing, we can’t really shut it down.” (emphasis in original).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried also drafted a contemplated Twitter thread to announce the shutdown of Alameda, and concluded: “I feel really uncertain what’s right! So I guess my plan is that, this coming weekend, we should just make a call, and enact it before next Monday, one way or another. Thoughts?”</p>
</li>

<p>Alameda was not shut down at this time or at any point during the Relevant Period.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist numeric text-justify">
<ol class="numeric" start="87">
<li>
<p>On November 2, 2022, the online digital asset news publication Coindesk.com published an article titled “Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried’s Crypto Empire Blur on His Trading Titan Alameda’s Balance Sheet,” and subtitled: “Alameda had $14.6 billion of assets as of June 30, according to a private document CoinDesk reviewed. Much of it is the FTT token issued by FTX, another Bankman-Fried company.” This article reported on a purported leaked Alameda balance sheet that showed that, at least as of June 30, 2022, an extremely high portion of Alameda’s $14.6 billion in assets consisted of the FTT token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On November 6, 2022, in response to this article, the CEO of Binance tweeted that, “[d]ue to recent revelations that have came [sic.] to light,” he would be selling the remainder of his significant FTT holdings, which he had acquired during the buyout from FTX seed investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In consultation with Bankman-Fried and others, Ellison responded on Twitter that Alameda would be willing to buy back all of Binance and Zhao’s FTT holdings at $22 per token. At the direction of Bankman-Fried and Ellison, FTX personnel began liquidating Alameda’s investments and trade positions to rapidly free up capital for FTT buybacks. Nevertheless, the market value of FTT steadily declined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the evening of November 6, as they monitored and reacted to the movements in FTT prices and the contagion effects on the digital asset market more broadly, Bankman-Fried, Ellison and another Alameda executive expressed surprise that these events had not had a larger negative impact on the prices of bitcoin, saying in a chat message:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock">[Alameda executive 1]: “I&#8217;m surprised BTC isnt down more”<br/>
Ellison: “me too”<br/>
Bankman-Fried: “yea me 3”</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this time, bitcoin market prices, including on U.S. exchanges, had indeed begun to decline, likely as a direct or indirect result of the events described herein.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, an increasing number of FTX customers began requesting to withdraw their assets from the exchange. FTX personnel initially managed to keep FTX’s systems operating quickly enough to keep up with withdrawals, but soon fell behind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By late in the day on November 7, it was apparent to Defendants that FTX did not have sufficient assets to cover all customer withdrawals, and that there were not sufficient assets held in various FTX accounts to cover all customer deposit obligations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried, Ellison and other key personnel of FTX and Alameda acknowledged internally that this shortfall was not merely a matter of having sufficient liquid assets on hand to cover customer withdrawals in the short term; rather, FTX customer assets were irrevocably lost because Alameda had misappropriated them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That same day, the Alameda traders who had been liquidating Alameda’s open positions to free up capital for FTT buybacks were directed by Bankman-Fried and Ellison to instead sell everything that could be sold quickly from Alameda’s holdings, to maximize open lines of credit or any other available sources of capital, and generally do anything possible to quickly obtain billions of dollars in capital to send to FTX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried, reinforcing this instruction, confirmed a trader’s summation of the directive as “close everything down to generate capital, maximally aggressive” to “liquidate all positions.” Bankman-Fried responded that “there is definitely a fair bit of urgency” and asked for the “ETA on getting at least $2b of USD.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On or about November 7, FTX US executives asked Wang and another FTX executive to evaluate the solvency of FTX US. They were readily able to carry out this request because numerous FTX personnel, including Wang, had access to and oversight of the FTX US (but not FTX US Derivatives) code, database and ledgers in the ordinary course of their duties. Wang and/or other FTX executives ultimately identified a shortfall they did not understand and were unable to quantify on FTX US.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankman-Fried quickly indicated that he would fill the hole at FTX US from liquidation of Alameda assets. On November 8, Bankman-Fried directed Alameda traders to prioritize meeting FTX US capital requirements and to send excess capital to FTX US. On information and belief, Alameda sent in excess of $185 million to FTX US to fill its shortfall.</p>

<p>Later that same day on November 8, Ellison stated in a chat message that “apparently part of what’s going on is that alameda actually has a long USDT/short USD margin position on FTX US that we aren’t tracking?” and said “which is why FTX US has less USD than we thought it should.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In direct contradiction of this internal series of events, on November 7, in public statements and various Twitter messages, Bankman-Fried and others acting on behalf of FTX continued to portray the shortfall that was causing customers to be unable to withdraw their assets as merely a liquidity problem. They affirmatively (and falsely) stated that FTX continued to be solvent and that all customer deposits were safe. For example, Bankman Fried tweeted:</p>

</div>
<div class="olist numeric text-justify">
<ol class="numeric" start="101">
<li>
<p>On information and belief, this and other tweets posted by Bankman-Fried on November 7-8, 2022 were intended to dissuade FTX customers from requesting to withdraw their assets from Defendants’ exchanges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This and other iterations of proposed tweets by Bankman-Fried were debated and rewritten among a small group of Defendants’ key employees and other of Bankman-Fried’s confidants. On information and belief, several individuals expressed concerns that Bankman-Fried’s tweet was inaccurate and/or misleading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time as Bankman-Fried was making these public assurances, he and numerous others acting on behalf of FTX were also reaching out to as many sources of funding as possible in an attempt to quickly raise several billion dollars to cover the shortfall in customer assets. As their calculation of the amount of the shortfall grew from $1-2 billion, to $2-4 billion, to as much as $8 billion, the number of viable potential rescue options diminished. Numerous parties declined to bail out FTX regardless of the favorable terms being offered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At approximately this same time, Bankman-Fried prepared or caused to be prepared a balance sheet to be shared with prospective investors showing the assets and liabilities of the companies. That balance sheet was unorthodox in a number of respects. Most notably, the balance sheet included an $8 billion negative balance from a “hidden, poorly internally labeled ‘fiat@’ account.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon information and belief, the “fiat@” account was in fact well-known to and understood by Bankman-Fried, who had previously directly managed and directed its use and characterization on the FTX systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On November 8, Bankman-Fried called the CEO of Binance to offer to sell FTX in its entirety to Binance. Binance initially accepted the offer and announced the news on Twitter, saying: “[t]his afternoon, FTX asked for our help. There is a significant liquidity crunch. To protect users, we signed a non-binding LOI [Letter of Intent], intending to fully acquire FTX and help cover the liquidity crunch. We will be conducting a full DD in the coming days.” Defendants thereafter provided Binance with various information in response to their due diligence inquiries in furtherance of the LOI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the morning of November 9 at approximately 10 AM ET, after the announcement of the then-contemplated Binance acquisition, Ellison held an “all-hands” meeting with Alameda staff. In that meeting, Ellison acknowledged that earlier that year, she, Bankman-Fried and other individuals had decided to use FTX customer assets to pay Alameda’s debts, and that Wang and another FTX executive were aware of this. Specifically, in that meeting, Ellison stated that, “starting last year” Alameda was “borrowing a bunch of money by open term loans” and used those assets to “make very illiquid investments.” Ellison further explained that following the widespread decline of digital asset prices most of Alameda’s loans had been recalled and, in order to meet those recalls, Alameda borrowed “a bunch of funds” from FTX, which in turn “led to FTX having a shortfall in user funds.” Ellison informed Alameda staff that FTX had “always allowed” Alameda to borrow customer assets, and did not require collateral for those loans. She also explained that Alameda could access user assets without requiring FTX’s approval as the “structure” allowed Alameda to “go negative in coins.” In response to an employee question, Ellison also acknowledged that her November 6 tweet to the Binance CEO offering to buy his FTT holdings at $22 per token was “kind of a misleading thing to tweet” and expressed remorse. Shortly after this meeting, most of Alameda’s staff resigned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On November 9, just one day after announcing the deal, Binance announced it would not be able to move forward with the deal to acquire FTX, saying: “[a]s a result of corporate due diligence, as well as the latest news reports regarding mishandled customer assets and alleged US agency investigations, we have decided that we will not pursue the potential acquisition of FTX.com.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the prospects of acquisition or bailout investment being unlikely, executives of Defendant entities and FTX US began advocating strongly for Bankman-Fried to move the FTX Enterprise towards bankruptcy and halt all remaining customer withdrawals from the platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On November 10, FTX and FTX US halted all trading and withdrawals, and Bankman-Fried announced that Alameda was being wound down. Bankman-Fried also posted a lengthy Twitter thread purporting to explain how he “f[<strong>*</strong>]ed up.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On November 10, at approximately 4:00 am ET, Bankman-Fried signed a document resigning his position as CEO of FTX and, as majority owner of all the FTX and Alameda companies, authorizing the appointment of an independent CEO and the filing of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next day, on November 11, 134 separate companies simultaneously filed for Bankruptcy as part of those proceedings, which are ongoing and being jointly administered in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In his initial declaration submitted shortly after the filing of the Bankruptcy petition, the FTX Enterprise’s newly-appointed CEO said the following of the situation he encountered at the FTX Enterprise:<br/>
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">I have over 40 years of legal and restructuring experience. I have been the Chief Restructuring Officer or Chief Executive Officer in several of the largest corporate failures in history. I have supervised situations involving allegations of criminal activity and malfeasance (Enron). I have supervised situations involving novel financial structures (Enron and Residential Capital) and cross-border asset recovery and maximization (Nortel and Overseas Shipholding). Nearly every situation in which I have been involved has been characterized by defects of some sort in internal controls, regulatory compliance, human resources and systems integrity.<br/>
Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here. From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the days and weeks since Bankman-Fried resigned from the companies, he has continued to make widespread public statements, provide explanations and make admissions, including in live interviews. Several of his statements admit key facts pled herein. For example, in a November 15 chat message interview with a Vox publication reporter, which Bankman-Fried has confirmed he participated in, he characterized the course of relevant events as follows:
<span class="quoteblock  text-justify">like, ‘oh FTX doesn’t have a bank account, I guess people can wire to Alameda’s to get money on FTX’ … 3 years later … ‘oh f*<strong>*</strong> it looks like people wired $8b to Alameda and oh god we basically forgot about the stub account that corresponded to that and so it was never delivered to FTX’</span></p>
