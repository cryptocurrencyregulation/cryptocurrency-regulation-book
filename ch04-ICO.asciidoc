On July 17th, 2017, the Securities Exchange Commission released a report analyzing whether The DAO violated U.S. securities laws by selling cryptocurrency tokens.  The DAO was the first major Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).  The DAO was launched on April 29, 2016.  In one of most famous crpytocurrency hacks, DAO funds were stolden on June 16th, 2016.  On July 20th, 2016, the Ethereum blockchain changed its software to return all of the stolen funds to the original owners.

*Report of Investigation Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO*

[upperroman, start=1]
. *Introduction and Summary*

[.text-justify]
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“Commission”) Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has investigated whether The DAO, an unincorporated organization; Slock.it UG (“Slock.it”), a German corporation; Slock.it’s co-founders; and intermediaries may have violated the federal securities laws. The Commission has determined not to pursue an enforcement action in this matter based on the conduct and activities known to the Commission at this time.
[.text-justify]
As described more fully below, The DAO is one example of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, which is a term used to describe a “virtual” organization embodied in computer code and executed on a distributed ledger or blockchain. The DAO was created by Slock.it and Slock.it’s co-founders, with the objective of operating as a for-profit entity that would create and hold a corpus of assets through the sale of DAO Tokens to investors, which assets would then be used to fund “projects.” The holders of DAO Tokens stood to share in the anticipated earnings from these projects as a return on their investment in DAO Tokens. In addition, DAO Token holders could monetize their investments in DAO Tokens by re-selling DAO Tokens on a number of web-based platforms (“Platforms”) that supported secondary trading in the DAO Tokens.
[.text-justify]
After DAO Tokens were sold, but before The DAO was able to commence funding projects, an attacker used a flaw in The DAO’s code to steal approximately one-third of The DAO’s assets. Slock.it’s co-founders and others responded by creating a work-around whereby DAO Token holders could opt to have their investment returned to them, as described in more detail below.
[.text-justify]
The investigation raised questions regarding the application of the U.S. federal securities laws to the offer and sale of DAO Tokens, including the threshold question whether DAO Tokens are securities. Based on the investigation, and under the facts presented, the Commission has determined that DAO Tokens are securities under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_1[1])*^ The Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to issue this report of investigation (“Report”) pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_2[2])*^ to advise those who would use a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (“DAO Entity”), or other distributed ledger or blockchain-enabled means for capital raising, to take appropriate steps to ensure compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws. All securities offered and sold in the United States must be registered with the Commission or must qualify for an exemption from the registration requirements. In addition, any entity or person engaging in the activities of an exchange must register as a national securities exchange or operate pursuant to an exemption from such registration.
[.text-justify]
This Report reiterates these fundamental principles of the U.S. federal securities laws and describes their applicability to a new paradigm—virtual organizations or capital raising entities that use distributed ledger or blockchain technology to facilitate capital raising and/or investment and the related offer and sale of securities. The automation of certain functions through this technology, “smart contracts,”^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_3[3])*^ or computer code, does not remove conduct from the purview of the U.S. federal securities laws.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_4[4])*^ This Report also serves to stress the obligation to comply with the registration provisions of the federal securities laws with respect to products and platforms involving emerging technologies and new investor interfaces.

[upperroman, start=2]
. *Facts*

[upperalpha, start=1]
. [underline]#Background#

[.text-justify]
From April 30, 2016 through May 28, 2016, The DAO offered and sold approximately 1.15 billion DAO Tokens in exchange for a total of approximately 12 million Ether (“ETH”), a virtual currency^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_5[5])*^ used on the Ethereum Blockchain.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_6[6])*^  As of the time the offering closed, the total ETH raised by The DAO was valued in U.S. Dollars (“USD”) at approximately $150 million.
[.text-justify]
The concept of a DAO Entity is memorialized in a document (the “White Paper”), authored by Christoph Jentzsch, the Chief Technology Officer of Slock.it, a “Blockchain and IoT [(internet-of-things)] solution company,” incorporated in Germany and co-founded by Christoph Jentzsch, Simon Jentzsch (Christoph Jentzsch’s brother), and Stephan Tual (“Tual”). ^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_7[7])*^ The White Paper purports to describe “the first implementation of a [DAO Entity] code to automate organizational governance and decision making.”^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_8[8])*^ The White Paper posits that a DAO Entity “can be used by individuals working together collaboratively outside of a traditional corporate form. It can also be used by a registered corporate entity to automate formal governance rules contained in corporate bylaws or imposed by law.” The White Paper proposes an entity—a DAO Entity—that would use smart contracts to attempt to solve governance issues it described as inherent in traditional corporations.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_9[9])*^ As described, a DAO Entity purportedly would supplant traditional mechanisms of corporate governance and management with a blockchain such that contractual terms are “formalized, automated and enforced using software.” ^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_10[10])*^


[upperalpha, start=2]
. [underline]#The DAO#

[.text-justify]
“The DAO” is the “first generation” implementation of the White Paper concept of a DAO Entity, and it began as an effort to create a “crowdfunding contract” to raise “funds to grow [a] company in the crypto space.”^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_11[11])*^ In November 2015, at an Ethereum Developer Conference in London, Christoph Jentzsch described his proposal for The DAO as a “for-profit DAO [Entity],” where participants would send ETH (a virtual currency) to The DAO to purchase DAO Tokens, which would permit the participant to vote and entitle the participant to “rewards.”^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_12[12])*^ Christoph Jentzsch likened this to “buying shares in a company and getting … dividends.”^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_13[13])*^ The DAO was to be “decentralized” in that it would allow for voting by investors holding DAO Tokens.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_14[14])*^ All funds raised were to be held at an Ethereum Blockchain “address” associated with The DAO and DAO Token holders were to vote on contract proposals, including proposals to The DAO to fund projects and distribute The DAO’s anticipated earnings from the projects it
funded. ^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_15[15])*^ The DAO was intended to be “autonomous” in that project proposals were in the form of smart contracts that exist on the Ethereum Blockchain and the votes were administered by the code of The DAO.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_16[16])*^
[.text-justify]
On or about April 29, 2016, Slock.it deployed The DAO code on the Ethereum Blockchain, as a set of pre-programmed instructions. ^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_17[17])*^ This code was to govern how The DAO was to operate.
[.text-justify]
To promote The DAO, Slock.it’s co-founders launched a website (“The DAO Website”). The DAO Website included a description of The DAO’s intended purpose: “To blaze a new path in business for the betterment of its members, existing simultaneously nowhere and everywhere and operating solely with the steadfast iron will of unstoppable code.”^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_18[18])*^ The DAO Website also described how The DAO operated, and included a link through which DAO Tokens could be purchased. The DAO Website also included a link to the White Paper, which provided detailed information about a DAO Entity’s structure and its source code and, together with The DAO Website, served as the primary source of promotional materials for The DAO. On The DAO Website and elsewhere, Slock.it represented that The DAO’s source code had been reviewed by “one of the world’s leading security audit companies” and “no stone was left unturned during those five whole days of security analysis.”^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_19[19])*^
[.text-justify]
Slock.it’s co-founders also promoted The DAO by soliciting media attention and by
posting almost daily updates on The DAO’s status on The DAO and Slock.it websites and
numerous online forums relating to blockchain technology. Slock.it’s co-founders used these
posts to communicate to the public information about how to participate in The DAO, including:
how to create and acquire DAO Tokens; the framework for submitting proposals for projects;
and how to vote on proposals. Slock.it also created an online forum on The DAO Website, as
well as administered “The DAO Slack” channel, an online messaging platform in which over
5,000 invited “team members” could discuss and exchange ideas about The DAO in real time.

[start=1]
. _DAO Tokens_

[.text-justify]
In exchange for ETH, The DAO created DAO Tokens (proportional to the amount of ETH paid) that were then assigned to the Ethereum Blockchain address of the person or entity remitting the ETH. A DAO Token granted the DAO Token holder certain voting and ownership rights. According to promotional materials, The DAO would earn profits by funding projects that would provide DAO Token holders a return on investment. The various promotional materials disseminated by Slock.it’s co-founders touted that DAO Token holders would receive “rewards,” which the White Paper defined as, “any [ETH] received by a DAO [Entity] generated from projects the DAO [Entity] funded.” DAO Token holders would then vote to either use the rewards to fund new projects or to distribute the ETH to DAO Token holders.
[.text-justify]
From April 30, 2016 through May 28, 2016 (the “Offering Period”), The DAO offered and sold DAO Tokens. Investments in The DAO were made “pseudonymously” (i.e., an individual’s or entity’s pseudonym was their Ethereum Blockchain address). To purchase a DAO Token offered for sale by The DAO, an individual or entity sent ETH from their Ethereum Blockchain address to an Ethereum Blockchain address associated with The DAO. All of the ETH raised in the offering as well as any future profits earned by The DAO were to be pooled and held in The DAO’s Ethereum Blockchain address. The token price fluctuated in a range of approximately 1 to 1.5 ETH per 100 DAO Tokens, depending on when the tokens were purchased during the Offering Period.  Anyone was eligible to purchase DAO Tokens (as long as they paid ETH). There ere no limitations placed on the number of DAO Tokens offered for sale, the number of purchasers of DAO Tokens, or the level of sophistication of such purchasers. 
[.text-justify]
DAO Token holders were not restricted from re-selling DAO Tokens acquired in the offering, and DAO Token holders could sell their DAO Tokens in a variety of ways in the secondary market and thereby monetize their investment as discussed below. Prior to the Offering Period, Slock.it solicited at least one U.S. web-based platform to trade DAO Tokens on
its system and, at the time of the offering, The DAO Website and other promotional materials disseminated by Slock.it included representations that DAO Tokens would be available for secondary market trading after the Offering Period via several platforms. During the Offering Period and afterwards, the Platforms posted notices on their own websites and on social media that each planned to support secondary market trading of DAO Tokens.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_20[20])*^
In addition to secondary market trading on the Platforms, after the Offering Period, DAO
Tokens were to be freely transferable on the Ethereum Blockchain. DAO Token holders would
also be permitted to redeem their DAO Tokens for ETH through a complicated, multi-week
(approximately 46-day) process referred to as a DAO Entity “split.”^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_21[21])*^

[start=2]
. _Participants in The DAO_

[.text-justify]
According to the White Paper, in order for a project to be considered for funding with “a DAO [Entity]’s [ETH],” a “Contractor” first must submit a proposal to the DAO Entity. Specifically, DAO Token holders expected Contractors to submit proposals for projects that could provide DAO Token holders returns on their investments. Submitting a proposal to The DAO involved: (1) writing a smart contract, and then deploying and publishing it on the Ethereum Blockchain; and (2) posting details about the proposal on The DAO Website, including the Ethereum Blockchain address of the deployed contract and a link to its source code. Proposals could be viewed on The DAO Website as well as other publicly-accessible websites. Per the White Paper, there were two prerequisites for submitting a proposal. An individual or entity must: (1) own at least one DAO Token; and (2) pay a deposit in the form of ETH that would be forfeited to the DAO Entity if the proposal was put up for a vote and failed to achieve a quorum of DAO Token holders. It was publicized that Slock.it would be the first to submit a proposal for funding.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_22[22])*^
[.text-justify]
ETH raised by The DAO was to be distributed to a Contractor to fund a proposal only on a majority vote of DAO Token holders.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_23[23])*^ DAO Token holders were to cast votes, which would be weighted by the number of tokens they controlled, for or against the funding of a specific proposal. The voting process, however, was publicly criticized in that it could incentivize distorted voting behavior and, as a result, would not accurately reflect the consensus of the majority of DAO Token holders. Specifically, as noted in a May 27, 2016 blog post by a group of computer security researchers, The DAO’s structure included a “strong positive bias to vote YES on proposals and to suppress NO votes as a side effect of the way in which it restricts users’ range of options following the casting of a vote.”^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_24[24])*^
[.text-justify]
Before any proposal was put to a vote by DAO Token holders, it was required to be reviewed by one or more of The DAO’s “Curators.” At the time of the formation of The DAO, the Curators were a group of individuals chosen by Slock.it.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_25[25])*^ According to the White Paper, the Curators of a DAO Entity had “considerable power.” The Curators performed crucial security functions and maintained ultimate control over which proposals could be submitted to, voted on, and funded by The DAO. As stated on The DAO Website during the Offering Period, The DAO relied on its Curators for “failsafe protection” and for protecting The DAO from “malicous [sic] actors.” Specifically, per The DAO Website, a Curator was responsible for: (1) confirming that any proposal for funding originated from an identifiable person or organization; and (2) confirming that smart contracts associated with any such proposal properly reflected the code the Contractor claims to have deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain. If a Curator determined that the proposal met these criteria, the Curator could add the proposal to the “whitelist,” which was a list of Ethereum Blockchain addresses that could receive ETH from The DAO if the majority of DAO Token holders voted for the proposal.
[.text-justify]
Curators of The DAO had ultimate discretion as to whether or not to submit a proposal for voting by DAO Token holders. Curators also determined the order and frequency of proposals, and could impose subjective criteria for whether the proposal should be whitelisted. One member of the group chosen by Slock.it to serve collectively as the Curator stated publicly that the Curator had “complete control over the whitelist … the order in which things get whitelisted, the duration for which [proposals] get whitelisted, when things get unwhitelisted … [and] clear ability to control the order and frequency of proposals,” noting that “curators have tremendous power.”^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_26[26])*^ Another Curator publicly announced his subjective criteria for determining whether to whitelist a proposal, which included his personal ethics.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_27[27])*^ Per the White Paper, a Curator also had the power to reduce the voting quorum requirement by 50% every other week. Absent action by a Curator, the quorum could be reduced by 50% only if no proposal had reached the required quorum for 52 weeks.

[start=3]
. _Secondary Market Trading on the Platforms_

[.text-justify]
During the period from May 28, 2016 through early September 2016, the Platforms became the preferred vehicle for DAO Token holders to buy and sell DAO Tokens in the secondary market using virtual or fiat currencies. Specifically, the Platforms used electronic systems that allowed their respective customers to post orders for DAO Tokens on an anonymous basis. For example, customers of each Platform could buy or sell DAO Tokens by entering a market order on the Platform’s system, which would then match with orders from other customers residing on the system. Each Platform’s system would automatically execute these orders based on pre-programmed order interaction protocols established by the Platform.
[.text-justify]
None of the Platforms received orders for DAO Tokens from non-Platform customers or routed its respective customers’ orders to any other trading destinations. The Platforms publicly displayed all their quotes, trades, and daily trading volume in DAO Tokens on their respective websites. During the period from May 28, 2016 through September 6, 2016, one such Platform executed more than 557,378 buy and sell transactions in DAO Tokens by more than 15,000 of its U.S. and foreign customers. During the period from May 28, 2016 through August 1, 2016, another such Platform executed more than 22,207 buy and sell transactions in DAO Tokens by more than 700 of its U.S. customers.

[start=4]
. _Security Concerns, The “Attack” on The DAO, and The Hard Fork_

[.text-justify]
In late May 2016, just prior to the expiration of the Offering Period, concerns about the safety and security of The DAO’s funds began to surface due to vulnerabilities in The DAO’s code. On May 26, 2016, in response to these concerns, Slock.it submitted a “DAO Security Proposal” that called for the development of certain updates to The DAO’s code and the appointment of a security expert.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_28[28])*^ Further, on June 3, 2016, Christoph Jentzsch, on behalf of Slock.it, proposed a moratorium on all proposals until alterations to The DAO’s code to fix vulnerabilities in The DAO’s code had been implemented.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_29[29])*^
[.text-justify]
On June 17, 2016, an unknown individual or group (the “Attacker”) began rapidly diverting ETH from The DAO, causing approximately 3.6 million ETH—1/3 of the total ETH raised by The DAO offering—to move from The DAO’s Ethereum Blockchain address to an Ethereum Blockchain address controlled by the Attacker (the “Attack”).^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_30[30])*^ Although the diverted ETH was then held in an address controlled by the Attacker, the Attacker was prevented by The DAO’s code from moving the ETH from that address for 27 days.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_31[31])*^31
[.text-justify]
In order to secure the diverted ETH and return it to DAO Token holders, Slock.it’s cofounders and others endorsed a “Hard Fork” to the Ethereum Blockchain. The “Hard Fork,” called for a change in the Ethereum protocol on a going forward basis that would restore the DAO Token holders’ investments as if the Attack had not occurred. On July 20, 2016, after a majority of the Ethereum network adopted the necessary software updates, the new, forked Ethereum Blockchain became active.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_32[32])*^ The Hard Fork had the effect of transferring all of the funds raised (including those held by the Attacker) from The DAO to a recovery address, where DAO Token holders could exchange their DAO Tokens for ETH.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_33[33])*^ All DAO Token holders who adopted the Hard Fork could exchange their DAO Tokens for ETH, and avoid any loss of the ETH they had invested.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_34[34])*^

[upperroman, start=3]
. *Discussion*

[.text-justify]
The Commission is aware that virtual organizations and associated individuals and entities increasingly are using distributed ledger technology to offer and sell instruments such as DAO Tokens to raise capital. These offers and sales have been referred to, among other things, as “Initial Coin Offerings” or “Token Sales.” Accordingly, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to issue this Report in order to stress that the U.S. federal securities law may apply to various activities, including distributed ledger technology, depending on the particular facts and circumstances, without regard to the form of the organization or technology used to effectuate a particular offer or sale. In this Report, the Commission considers the particular facts and circumstances of the offer and sale of DAO Tokens to demonstrate the application of existing U.S. federal securities laws to this new paradigm.

[upperalpha, start=1]
. [underline]#Section 5 of the Securities Act#

[.text-justify]
The registration provisions of the Securities Act contemplate that the offer or sale  securities to the public must be accompanied by the “full and fair disclosure” afforded by registration with the Commission and delivery of a statutory prospectus containing information necessary to enable prospective purchasers to make an informed investment decision. Registration entails disclosure of detailed “information about the issuer’s financial condition, the identity and background of management, and the price and amount of securities to be offered … .” SEC v. Cavanagh, 1 F. Supp. 2d 337, 360 (S.D.N.Y. 1998), aff’d, 155 F.3d 129 (2d Cir. 1998). “The registration statement is designed to assure public access to material facts bearing on the value of publicly traded securities and is central to the Act’s comprehensive scheme for protecting public investors.” SEC v. Aaron, 605 F.2d 612, 618 (2d Cir. 1979) (citing SEC v. Ralston Purina Co., 346 U.S. 119, 124 (1953)), vacated on other grounds, 446 U.S. 680 (1980). Section 5(a) of the Securities Act provides that, unless a registration statement is in effect as to a security, it is unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to engage in the offer or sale of securities in interstate commerce. Section 5(c) of the Securities Act provides a similar prohibition against offers to sell, or offers to buy, unless a registration statement has been filed. Thus, both Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act prohibit the unregistered offer or sale of securities in interstate commerce. 15 U.S.C. § 77e(a) and (c). Violations of Section 5 do not require scienter. SEC v. Universal Major Indus. Corp., 546 F.2d 1044, 1047 (2d Cir. 1976).

.. _Foundational Principles of the Securities Laws Apply to Virtual Organizations or Capital Raising Entities Making Use of Distributed Ledger Technology_

[.text-justify]
Under Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act, a security includes “an investment contract.” See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77b-77c. An investment contract is an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. See SEC v. Edwards, 540 U.S. 389, 393 (2004); SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 301 (1946); see also United Housing Found., Inc. v. Forman, 421 U.S. 837, 852-53 (1975) (The “touchstone” of an investment contract “is the presence of an investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.”). This definition embodies a “flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.” Howey, 328 U.S. at 299 (emphasis added). The test “permits the fulfillment of the statutory purpose of compelling full and fair disclosure relative to the issuance of ‘the many types of instruments that in our commercial world fall within the ordinary concept of a security.’” Id. In analyzing whether something is a security, “form should be disregarded for substance,” Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967), “and the emphasis should be on economic realities underlying a transaction, and not on the name appended thereto.” United Housing Found., 421 U.S. at 849.

[numeric, start=2]
.. _Investors in The DAO Invested Money_

[.text-justify]
In determining whether an investment contract exists, the investment of “money” need not take the form of cash. See, e.g., Uselton v. Comm. Lovelace Motor Freight, Inc., 940 F.2d 564, 574 (10th Cir. 1991) (“[I]n spite of Howey’s reference to an ‘investment of money,’ it is well established that cash is not the only form of contribution or investment that will create an investment contract.”).
[.text-justify]
Investors in The DAO used ETH to make their investments, and DAO Tokens were received in exchange for ETH. Such investment is the type of contribution of value that can create an investment contract under Howey. See SEC v. Shavers, No. 4:13-CV-416, 2014 WL 4652121, at *1 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 18, 2014) (holding that an investment of Bitcoin, a virtual currency, meets the first prong of Howey); Uselton, 940 F.2d at 574 (“[T]he ‘investment’ may take the form of ‘goods and services,’ or some other ‘exchange of value’.”) (citations omitted). 

[numeric, start=3]
.. _With a Reasonable Expectation of Profits_

[.text-justify]
Investors who purchased DAO Tokens were investing in a common enterprise  reasonably expected to earn profits through that enterprise when they sent ETH to The DAO’s Ethereum Blockchain address in exchange for DAO Tokens. “[P]rofits” include “dividends, other periodic payments, or the increased value of the investment.” Edwards, 540 U.S. at 394. As described above, the various promotional materials disseminated by Slock.it and its cofounders informed investors that The DAO was a for-profit entity whose objective was to fund projects in exchange for a return on investment.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_35[35])*^ The ETH was pooled and available to The DAO to fund projects. The projects (or “contracts”) would be proposed by Contractors. If the proposed contracts were whitelisted by Curators, DAO Token holders could vote on whether The DAO should fund the proposed contracts. Depending on the terms of each particular contract, DAO Token holders stood to share in potential profits from the contracts. Thus, a reasonable investor would have been motivated, at least in part, by the prospect of profits on their investment of ETH in The DAO.

[numeric, start=4]
.. _Derived from the Managerial Efforts of Others_

[loweralpha, start=1]
... The Efforts of Slock.it, Slock.it’s Co-Founders, and The DAO’s Curators Were Essential to the Enterprise

[.text-justify]
Investors’ profits were to be derived from the managerial efforts of others—specifically, Slock.it and its co-founders, and The DAO’s Curators. The central issue is “whether the efforts made by those other than the investor are the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise.” SEC v. Glenn W. Turner Enters., Inc., 474 F.2d 476, 482 (9th Cir. 1973). The DAO’s investors relied on the managerial and entrepreneurial efforts of Slock.it and its co-founders, and The DAO’s Curators, to manage The DAO and put forth project proposals that could generate profits for The DAO’s investors. 
[.text-justify]
Investors’ expectations were primed by the marketing of The DAO and active engagement between Slock.it and its co-founders with The DAO and DAO Token holders. To market The DAO and DAO Tokens, Slock.it created The DAO Website on which it published the White Paper explaining how a DAO Entity would work and describing their vision for a DAO Entity. Slock.it also created and maintained other online forums that it used to provide information to DAO Token holders about how to vote and perform other tasks related to their investment. Slock.it appears to have closely monitored these forums, answering questions from DAO Token holders about a variety of topics, including the future of The DAO, security concerns, ground rules for how The DAO would work, and the anticipated role of DAO Token holders. The creators of The DAO held themselves out to investors as experts in Ethereum, the blockchain protocol on which The DAO operated, and told investors that they had selected persons to serve as Curators based on their expertise and credentials. Additionally, Slock.it told investors that it expected to put forth the first substantive profit-making contract proposal—a blockchain venture in its area of expertise. Through their conduct and marketing materials, Slock.it and its co-founders led investors to believe that they could be relied on to provide the significant managerial efforts required to make The DAO a success.
[.text-justify]
Investors in The DAO reasonably expected Slock.it and its co-founders, and The DAO’s Curators, to provide significant managerial efforts after The DAO’s launch. The expertise of The DAO’s creators and Curators was critical in monitoring the operation of The DAO, safeguarding investor funds, and determining whether proposed contracts should be put for a vote. Investors had little choice but to rely on their expertise. At the time of the offering, The DAO’s protocols had already been pre-determined by Slock.it and its co-founders, including the control that could be exercised by the Curators. Slock.it and its co-founders chose the Curators, whose function it was to: (1) vet Contractors; (2) determine whether and when to submit proposals for votes; (3) determine the order and frequency of proposals that were submitted for a vote; and (4) determine whether to halve the default quorum necessary for a successful vote on certain proposals. Thus, the Curators exercised significant control over the order and frequency of proposals, and could impose their own subjective criteria for whether the proposal should be whitelisted for a vote by DAO Token holders. DAO Token holders’ votes were limited to proposals whitelisted by the Curators, and, although any DAO Token holder could put forth a proposal, each proposal would follow the same protocol, which included vetting and control by the current Curators. While DAO Token holders could put forth proposals to replace a Curator, such proposals were subject to control by the current Curators, including whitelisting and approval of the new address to which the tokens would be directed for such a proposal. In essence, Curators had the power to determine whether a proposal to remove a Curator was put to a vote. ^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_36[36])*^
[.text-justify]
And, Slock.it and its co-founders did, in fact, actively oversee The DAO. They monitored The DAO closely and addressed issues as they arose, proposing a moratorium on all proposals until vulnerabilities in The DAO’s code had been addressed and a security expert to monitor potential attacks on The DAO had been appointed. When the Attacker exploited a weakness in the code and removed investor funds, Slock.it and its co-founders stepped in to help resolve the situation.

[loweralpha, start=2]
... DAO Token Holders’ Voting Rights Were Limited

[.text-justify]
Although DAO Token holders were afforded voting rights, these voting rights were limited. DAO Token holders were substantially reliant on the managerial efforts of Slock.it, its co-founders, and the Curators. ^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_37[37])*^ Even if an investor’s efforts help to make an enterprise profitable, those efforts do not necessarily equate with a promoter’s significant managerial efforts or control over the enterprise. See, e.g., Glenn W. Turner, 474 F.2d at 482 (finding that a multi-level marketing scheme was an investment contract and that investors relied on the promoter’s managerial efforts, despite the fact that investors put forth the majority of the labor that made the enterprise profitable, because the promoter dictated the terms and controlled the scheme itself); Long v. Shultz, 881 F.2d 129, 137 (5th Cir. 1989) (“An investor may authorize the assumption of particular risks that would create the possibility of greater profits or losses but still depend on a third party for all of the essential managerial efforts without which the risk could not pay off.”). See also generally SEC v. Merchant Capital, LLC, 483 F.3d 747 (11th Cir. 2007) (finding an investment contract even where voting rights were provided to purported general partners, noting that the voting process provided limited information for investors to make informed decisions, and the purported general partners lacked control over the information in the ballots).
[.text-justify]
The voting rights afforded DAO Token holders did not provide them with meaningful control over the enterprise, because (1) DAO Token holders’ ability to vote for contracts was a largely perfunctory one; and (2) DAO Token holders were widely dispersed and limited in their ability to communicate with one another.
[.text-justify]
First, as discussed above, DAO Token holders could only vote on proposals that had been cleared by the Curators.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_38[38])*^ And that clearance process did not include any mechanism to provide DAO Token holders with sufficient information to permit them to make informed voting decisions. Indeed, based on the particular facts concerning The DAO and the few draft proposals discussed in online forums, there are indications that contract proposals would not have necessarily provide enough information for investors to make an informed voting decision, affording them less meaningful control. For example, the sample contract proposal attached to the White Paper included little information concerning the terms of the contract. Also, the Slock.it co-founders put forth a draft of their own contract proposal and, in response to questions and requests to negotiate the terms of the proposal (posted to a DAO forum), a Slock.it founder explained that the proposal was intentionally vague and that it was, in essence, a take it or leave it proposition not subject to negotiation or feedback. See, e.g., SEC v. Shields, 744 F.3d 633, 643-45 (10th Cir. 2014) (in assessing whether agreements were investment contracts, court looked to whether “the investors actually had the type of control reserved under the agreements to obtain access to information necessary to protect, manage, and control their investments at the time they purchased their interests.”).
[.text-justify]
Second, the pseudonymity and dispersion of the DAO Token holders made it difficult for them to join together to effect change or to exercise meaningful control. Investments in The DAO were made pseudonymously (such that the real-world identities of investors are not apparent), and there was great dispersion among those individuals and/or entities who were invested in The DAO and thousands of individuals and/or entities that traded DAO Tokens in the secondary market—an arrangement that bears little resemblance to that of a genuine general partnership. Cf. Williamson v. Tucker, 645 F.2d 404, 422-24 (5th Cir. 1981) (“[O]ne would not expect partnership interests sold to large numbers of the general public to provide any real partnership control; at some point there would be so many [limited] partners that a partnership vote would be more like a corporate vote, each partner’s role having been diluted to the level of a single shareholder in a corporation.”).^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_39[39])*^ Slock.it did create and maintain online forums on which investors could submit posts regarding contract proposals, which were not limited to use by DAO Token holders (anyone was permitted to post). However, DAO Token holders were pseudonymous, as were their posts to the forums. Those facts, combined with the sheer number of DAO Token holders, potentially made the forums of limited use if investors hoped to consolidate their votes into blocs powerful enough to assert actual control. This was later demonstrated through the fact that DAO Token holders were unable to effectively address the Attack without the assistance of Slock.it and others. The DAO Token holders’ pseudonymity and dispersion diluted their control over The DAO. See Merchant Capital, 483 F.3d at 758 (finding geographic dispersion of investors weighing against investor control).
[.text-justify]
These facts diminished the ability of DAO Token holders to exercise meaningful control over the enterprise through the voting process, rendering the voting rights of DAO Token holders akin to those of a corporate shareholder. Steinhardt Group, Inc. v. Citicorp., 126 F.3d 144, 152 (3d Cir. 1997) (“It must be emphasized that the assignment of nominal or limited responsibilities to the participant does not negate the existence of an investment contract; where the duties
assigned are so narrowly circumscribed as to involve little real choice of action … a security may be found to exist … . [The] emphasis must be placed on economic reality.”) (citing SEC v. Koscot Interplanetary, Inc., 497 F.2d 473, 483 n. 14 (5th Cir. 1974)).
[.text-justify]
By contract and in reality, DAO Token holders relied on the significant managerial efforts provided by Slock.it and its co-founders, and The DAO’s Curators, as described above. Their efforts, not those of DAO Token holders, were the “undeniably significant” ones, essential to the overall success and profitability of any investment into The DAO. See Glenn W. Turner, 474 F.2d at 482.

.. [underline]#Issuers Must Register Offers and Sales of Securities Unless a Valid Exemption Applies#

[.text-justify]
The definition of “issuer” is broadly defined to include “every person who issues or proposes to issue any security” and “person” includes “any unincorporated organization.” 15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(4). The term “issuer” is flexibly construed in the Section 5 context “as issuers devise new ways to issue their securities and the definition of a security itself expands.” Doran v. Petroleum Mgmt. Corp., 545 F.2d 893, 909 (5th Cir. 1977); accord SEC v. Murphy, 626 F.2d 633, 644 (9th Cir. 1980) (“[W]hen a person [or entity] organizes or sponsors the organization of limited partnerships and is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the venture for which the partnership is formed, he will be considered an issuer … .”).
[.text-justify]
The DAO, an unincorporated organization, was an issuer of securities, and information about The DAO was “crucial” to the DAO Token holders’ investment decision. See Murphy, 626 F.2d at 643 (“Here there is no company issuing stock, but instead, a group of individuals investing funds in an enterprise for profit, and receiving in return an entitlement to a percentage of the proceeds of the enterprise.”) (citation omitted). The DAO was “responsible for the success or failure of the enterprise,” and accordingly was the entity about which the investors needed information material to their investment decision. Id. at 643-44. During the Offering Period, The DAO offered and sold DAO Tokens in exchange for ETH through The DAO Website, which was publicly-accessible, including to individuals in the United States. During the Offering Period, The DAO sold approximately 1.15 billion DAO Tokens in exchange for a total of approximately 12 million ETH, which was valued in USD, at the time, at approximately $150 million. Because DAO Tokens were securities, The DAO was required to register the offer and sale of DAO Tokens, unless a valid exemption from such registration applied.
[.text-justify]
Moreover, those who participate in an unregistered offer and sale of securities not subject to a valid exemption are liable for violating Section 5. See, e.g., Murphy, 626 F.2d at 650-51 (“[T]hose who ha[ve] a necessary role in the transaction are held liable as participants.”) (citing SEC v. North Am. Research & Dev. Corp., 424 F.2d 63, 81 (2d Cir. 1970); SEC v. Culpepper, 270 F.2d 241, 247 (2d Cir. 1959); SEC v. International Chem. Dev. Corp., 469 F.2d 20, 28 (10th Cir. 1972); Pennaluna & Co. v. SEC, 410 F.2d 861, 864 n.1, 868 (9th Cir. 1969)); SEC v. Softpoint, Inc., 958 F. Supp 846, 859-60 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (“The prohibitions of Section 5 … sweep[] broadly to encompass ‘any person’ who participates in the offer or sale of an unregistered, non-exempt security.”); SEC v. Chinese Consol. Benevolent Ass’n., 120 F.2d 738, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1941) (defendant violated Section 5(a) “because it engaged in selling unregistered securities” issued by a third party “when it solicited offers to buy the securities ‘for value’”).

[upperalpha, start=4]
.. [underline]#A System that Meets the Definition of an Exchange Must Register as a National Securities Exchange or Operate Pursuant to an Exemption from Such Registration#

[.text-justify]
Section 5 of the Exchange Act makes it unlawful for any broker, dealer, or exchange, directly or indirectly, to effect any transaction in a security, or to report any such transaction, in interstate commerce, unless the exchange is registered as a national securities exchange under Section 6 of the Exchange Act, or is exempted from such registration. See 15 U.S.C. §78e. Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act defines an “exchange” as “any organization, association, or group of persons, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which constitutes, maintains, or provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood … .” 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(1). Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) provides a functional test to assess whether a trading system meets the definition of exchange under Section 3(a)(1). Under Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a), an organization, association, or group of persons shall be considered to constitute, maintain, or provide “a marketplace or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange,” if such organization, association, or group of persons: (1) brings together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers; and (2) uses established, non-discretionary methods (whether by providing a trading facility or by setting rules) under which such orders interact with each other, and the buyers and sellers entering such orders agree to the terms of the trade.^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_40[40])*^
A system that meets the criteria of Rule 3b-16(a), and is not excluded under Rule 3b16(b), must register as a national securities exchange pursuant to Sections 5 and 6 of the Exchange Act ^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_41[41])*^ or operate pursuant to an appropriate exemption. One frequently used exemption is for alternative trading systems (“ATS”).^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_42[42])*^ Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) exempts from the definition of “exchange” under Section 3(a)(1) an ATS that complies with Regulation ATS,^*(xref:ico_dao_footnote_43[43])*^ which includes, among other things, the requirement to register as a broker-dealer and file a Form ATS with the Commission to provide notice of the ATS’s operations. Therefore, an ATS that operates pursuant to the Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) exemption and complies with Regulation ATS would not be subject to the registration requirement of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.
[.text-justify]
The Platforms that traded DAO Tokens appear to have satisfied the criteria of Rule 3b16(a) and do not appear to have been excluded from Rule 3b-16(b). As described above, the Platforms provided users with an electronic system that matched orders from multiple parties to buy and sell DAO Tokens for execution based on non-discretionary methods.

. *Conclusion and References for Additional Guidance*

[.text-justify]
Whether or not a particular transaction involves the offer and sale of a security— regardless of the terminology used—will depend on the facts and circumstances, including the economic realities of the transaction. Those who offer and sell securities in the United States must comply with the federal securities laws, including the requirement to register with the Commission or to qualify for an exemption from the registration requirements of the federal
securities laws. The registration requirements are designed to provide investors with procedural protections and material information necessary to make informed investment decisions. These requirements apply to those who offer and sell securities in the United States, regardless whether the issuing entity is a traditional company or a decentralized autonomous organization, regardless whether those securities are purchased using U.S. dollars or virtual currencies, and regardless whether they are distributed in certificated form or through distributed ledger technology. In addition, any entity or person engaging in the activities of an exchange, such as bringing together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers using established nondiscretionary methods under which such orders interact with each other and buyers and sellers entering such orders agree upon the terms of the trade, must register as a national securities exchange or operate pursuant to an exemption from such registration.

It is not issued or guaranteed by any jurisdiction, and fulfils the above functions only by agreement within the community of users of the virtual currency. Virtual currency is distinguished from fiat currency (a.k.a. “real currency,” “real money,” or “national currency”), which is the coin and paper money of a country that is designated as its legal tender; circulates; and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the issuing country. It is distinct from e-money, which is a digital representation of fiat currency used to electronically transfer value denominated in fiat currency.#

the proposal is closed.”). If, however, a DAO Token holder abstained from voting, the DAO Token holder could
avoid these restrictions; any DAO Tokens not submitted for a vote could be withdrawn or transferred at any time.
As a result, DAO Token holders were incentivized either to vote yes or to abstain from voting. See Dino Mark et al.,

change the core analysis that investors purchased DAO Tokens with the expectation of earning profits from the
efforts of others.
[[ico_dao_footnote_36]]
[.text-justify]
[36] DAO Token holders could put forth a proposal to split from The DAO, which would result in the creation of a
new DAO Entity with a new Curator. Other DAO Token holders would be allowed to join the new DAO Entity as
long as they voted yes to the original “split” proposal. Unlike all other contract proposals, a proposal to split did not require a deposit or a quorum, and it required a seven-day debating period instead of the minimum two-week
debating period required for other proposals.
[[ico_dao_footnote_37]]
[.text-justify]
[37] Because, as described above, DAO Token holders were incentivized either to vote yes or to abstain from voting,
the results of DAO Token holder voting would not necessarily reflect the actual view of a majority of DAO Token
holders.
[[ico_dao_footnote_38]]
[.text-justify]
[38] Because, in part, The DAO never commenced its business operations funding projects, this Report does not
analyze the question whether anyone associated with The DAO was an “[i]nvestment adviser” under Section
202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). See 15 U.S.C. § 80b-2(a)(11). Those who
would use virtual organizations should consider their obligations under the Advisers Act.

[39] The Fifth Circuit in Williamson stated that:

[.quoteblock .text-justify]#A general partnership or joint venture interest can be designated a security if the investor can establish, for example, that (1) an agreement among the parties leaves so little power in the hands of the partner or venture that the arrangement in fact distributes power as would a limited partnership; or (2) the partner or venturer is so inexperienced and unknowledgeable in business affairs that he is incapable of intelligently exercising his partnership or venture powers; or (3) the partner or venturer is so dependent on some unique entrepreneurial or managerial ability of the promoter or manager that he cannot replace the manager of the enterprise or otherwise exercise meaningful partnership or venture powers.#

Williamson, 645 F.2d at 424 & n.15 (court also noting that, “this is not to say that other factors could not also give rise to such a dependence on the promoter or manager that the exercise of partnership powers would be effectively precluded.”).

the Commission believed did not meet the exchange definition. These systems include systems that merely route
orders to other execution facilities and systems that allow persons to enter orders for execution against the bids and
offers of a single dealer system. See Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 40760 (Dec. 8, 1998), 63 FR 70844 (Dec. 22,

[.text-justify]
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against Zachary Coburn (“Coburn” or “Respondent”).

[.text-center]

[.text-justify]
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer of Settlement (the “Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

[.text-center]
*III.*

On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds^*(xref:coburn_footnote_1[1])*^ that:

[.text-center]
[underline]#Summary#

. As described more fully below, EtherDelta is an online platform that allows buyers and sellers to trade certain digital assets – Ether and “ERC20 tokens” – in secondary market trading. ERC20 tokens refer to digital assets issued and distributed on the Ethereum Blockchain using the ERC20 protocol, which is the standard coding protocol currently used by a significant majority of issuers in Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”).^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_2[2])*^
. EtherDelta’s website, launched by Coburn on July 12, 2016, provides a user-friendly interface to EtherDelta and resembles online securities trading platforms. For example, the website makes token “pairs”^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_3[3])*^ available for trading, provides access to the EtherDelta order book, and displays the current, top 500 firm bids and offers by symbol, price, and size. The website also displays account information for users of the EtherDelta platform (“Users”) (tracked by the User’s Ethereum address and maintained in an internal ledger) and provides fields for Users to input trading interest in any token pair. Users may enter orders to buy or sell specified quantities of any ERC20 token at a specified price (in Ether) and with a specified time-in-force. The website also displays to Users market depth^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_4[4])*^ charts and a list of confirmed trades.
. On July 25, 2017, the Commission issued its Report of Investigation Pursuant To Section 21(a) Of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO (Exchange Act Rel. No. 81207) (July 25, 2017) (the “DAO Report”). In the DAO Report, the Commission advised that a platform that offers trading of digital assets that are securities and operates as an “exchange,” as defined by the federal securities laws, must register with the Commission as a national securities exchange or be exempt from registration.
. From July 12, 2016 to December 15, 2017 (the “Relevant Period”), more than 3.6 million buy and sell orders in ERC20 tokens that included securities as defined by Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act were traded on EtherDelta, of which approximately 92% (3.3 million) were traded during the period following the DAO Report.
. As discussed further below, EtherDelta meets the criteria of an “exchange” as defined by Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 3b-16 thereunder. During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta was not registered with the Commission as a national securities exchange and it did not operate pursuant to any exemption from registration. As a result, and as discussed further below, Coburn should have known that his actions would contribute to EtherDelta’s violations and thus, under Exchange Act Section 21C(a), caused EtherDelta to violate Section 5 of the Exchange Act. 

[.text-center] 
[underline]#Respondent# 

[start=6]
. Coburn, age 31, is a resident of Chicago, Illinois. From September 2010 to June 2015, Coburn was a registered representative with a Chicago-based options trading firm that was a broker-dealer registered with the Commission. In approximately June 2015, Coburn left that firm to pursue his own business interests. In March 2016, he created EtherOpt, an online platform for trading options and, in July 2016, he created EtherDelta.^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_5[5])*^ In November 2017, Coburn entered into an agreement to sell EtherDelta to foreign buyers and, as of December 16, 2017, Coburn ceased to collect any fees from Users of the platform. Coburn does not currently operate EtherDelta. 

[.text-center] 
[underline]#Facts# +
[underline]#The EtherDelta Website and Hours of Operations# 

[start=7]
. As seen below, the EtherDelta website had features similar to online securities trading platforms. For each Ether/ERC20 token pair available for trading on EtherDelta, the website provided access to the EtherDelta order book and displayed the top 500 orders to buy and orders to sell, sorted by price and color (buy orders are green and sell orders are red). The website provided User account information and provided fields for Users to input deposit, withdrawal, and trading interest. The website also provided Users’ daily transaction volumes per token, market depth charts, and a list of User’s confirmed trades.
. During the Relevant Period, the EtherDelta platform was available to anyone, including U.S. persons, and had no specified hours of operation. As long as EtherDelta’s website was operational, Users could interact directly with the EtherDelta smart contract or enter orders and trade tokens through the website 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

[align="center"]
image::media/ch03-img01.jpg[]


[.text-center] 
[underline]#The EtherDelta Smart Contract# 

[start=9]
. EtherDelta’s business operations are defined and executed by EtherDelta’s “smart contract”^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_6[6])*^ that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain. The EtherDelta smart contract consists of coded functions^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_7[7])*^ that allow for, among other things, the trading of any Ether/ ERC20 token pair.^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_8[8])*^ On July 8, 2016, Coburn deployed the code for the first EtherDelta smart contract, written in the programming language Solidity, onto the Ethereum Blockchain. When it was deployed, the EtherDelta smart contract created an Ethereum Blockchain address, where the smart contract “resides.”^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_9[9])*^
. Because the EtherDelta smart contract runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, every interaction with EtherDelta by a User requires the User to send a message to the Ethereum Blockchain mining network to be executed on the EtherDelta smart contract.^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_10[10])*^ When Ethereum Blockchain miners run the EtherDelta smart contract, the smart contract applies a preexisting set of rules (i.e., its code) to given inputs. If the User’s message results in a change of state to the Ethereum Blockchain, such as through a User request to move or withdraw ERC20 tokens to and from the EtherDelta smart contract, or through a User request to trade on the EtherDelta platform, among other things, the Ethereum Blockchain miners then record that change of state, i.e., reflecting the transfer of Ether and/or ERC20 tokens to and from addresses, to the Ethereum Blockchain. If the User’s message does not result in a change of state, such as through a User request to check the balance of the User’s Ethereum address on EtherDelta, there is no change of state recorded to the Ethereum Blockchain.

[.text-center] 
[underline]#EtherDelta User Eligibility# 

[start=11]
. As a prerequisite for submitting an order to the platform, a User must first have an Ethereum wallet address that is capable of sending messages to the Ethereum Blockchain. Users may create a new wallet address through EtherDelta’s website or by using other wallet software that is compatible with EtherDelta. Users trade on EtherDelta pseudonymously by using one or more Ethereum addresses, each a unique string of numbers and letters. Users must also demonstrate that they have available ERC20 tokens or Ether to trade on EtherDelta. 

[.text-center] 
[underline]#Tokens Eligible for Trading and EtherDelta’s “Official Listings”# 

[start=12]
. Users may enter orders to buy or sell any token that is ERC20 compliant. Coburn purposely wrote the EtherDelta smart contract to include the ERC20 token coding standard and there are no rules set forth in the smart contract that limit a User from trading any particular ERC20 token on EtherDelta.
. During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta maintained a list of “official [token] listings, a select list of ERC20 Tokens that were available for trading on EtherDelta.” Prior to identifying a token as an official listing, Coburn requested certain information from a token issuer (e.g., the token’s name, associated website URL, and a paragraph describing the token) and performed his own due diligence on these tokens. Official listings appeared on a drop down menu on a sidebar on EtherDelta’s website for easy User accessibility. During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta had approximately 500 official token listings.

[.text-center] 
[underline]#The EtherDelta Order Book# 

[start=14]
. With respect to a given order, an EtherDelta User is identified as either a “maker” or “taker” on the EtherDelta platform. A maker is someone that posts an order to buy or sell a particular ERC20 token on the EtherDelta website, which signals to other Users their intention to trade a particular token at a specific price, size, and time. A taker is someone seeking to become the counterparty to a maker’s order on the platform.

_Order Types and Order Entry_

[start=15]
. The only order type available on EtherDelta is a limit order to buy or sell a token at a specific price. There are no market orders.^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_11[11])*^  Users indicate their interest to buy or sell a token by entering a buy or sell order. At the time an order is entered, Users provide the following information onto the EtherDelta’s website: token symbol, size, price and time-in-force (measured in “blocks”).^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_12[12])*^ 
. Unlike other operations on EtherDelta, entering an order on EtherDelta does not change the state of the Ethereum Blockchain and, as a result, there is no gas fee (paid in Ether to the Ethereum miners) associated with entering an order on EtherDelta. Rather, all orders are stored in EtherDelta’s order book, which resides on a centralized server maintained by EtherDelta and not on the Ethereum Blockchain.^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_13[13])*^  As discussed above, for each token pair, EtherDelta’s website displays only the top 500 buy and sell orders, sorted by price and order type (buy or sell). 

_Order Execution and the Order Book_

[start=17]
. All orders on EtherDelta must be acted upon by a taker for a trade to occur. When a taker seeks to trade with a maker’s order, the taker, through the EtherDelta website interface, clicks on an order displayed on EtherDelta’s order book and enters the size of the order. This pairs the maker’s cryptographically-signed intent to trade (i.e., the maker order) with the taker’s cryptographically-signed intent to trade (i.e., the taker’s order) and instructs the Ethereum Blockchain miners to run the EtherDelta smart contract, which automatically performs certain checks.
. No further confirmation or action is required by the taker for the taker’s message to be executed by the smart contract and for a trade to occur. The smart contract checks that the messages are valid (contain valid cryptographic signatures), confirms the conditions of the orders (i.e., orders have not expired or been canceled) and that both Users have sufficient funds and/or tokens to complete the trade. If the messages are valid and there are sufficient funds and/or tokens, the trade is executed and the smart contract will update the smart contract’s internal ledger to reflect the trade. The maker order will remain displayed on EtherDelta’s website until the miners write the trade and post it to the Ethereum Blockchain. Thereafter, information displayed on the EtherDelta order book and website is updated.
. When a taker clicks on a maker’s order, this action will automatically result in a trade unless: (1) there are insufficient funds and/or tokens to complete the trade or pay the gas fee; (2) a competing taker’s order is confirmed on the Blockchain first; (3) the maker’s order has expired; or (4) the maker or taker’s order has been cancelled.^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_14[14])*^

[.text-center]
[underline]#Notices to Users#

[start=20]
. During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta Users were kept apprised of key events and other announcements regarding the platform’s operations through an official EtherDelta Twitter handle and Coburn’s posts on Reddit.^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_15[15])*^ Coburn also responded to User questions through an official “Gitter channel,” a public internet forum for Users and EtherDelta representatives to post written questions and answers about EtherDelta’s operations.
. In posts on Reddit, Coburn explained that: “[a]t a high level, EtherDelta functions just like a normal exchange” and “[l]ike any other exchange, EtherDelta has an order book of resting orders.”^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_16[16])*^ However, unlike a traditional exchange, “[t]here is no ‘exchange owner’ holding your funds. Hence, [EtherDelta is] decentralized.... Centralized exchanges won't be able to show you verified business logic [in a publicly verified smart contract].”

[.text-center]
[underline]#Platform Fees#

[start=22]
. To promote trade volume, EtherDelta did not charge a fee to a maker for placing an order. Takers, on the other hand, were charged 0.3% of a transaction’s trade volume.^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_17[17])*^

[.text-center]
[underline]#Legal Analysis#

*A. EtherDelta Violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act*
[start=23] 
. Section 5 of the Exchange Act makes it unlawful for any broker, dealer, or exchange, directly or indirectly, to effect any transaction in a security, or to report any such transaction, in interstate commerce, unless the exchange is registered as a national securities exchange under Section 6 of the Exchange Act, or is exempted from such registration. Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act defines an “exchange” as “any organization, association, or group of persons, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which constitutes, maintains, or provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood, and includes the market place and the market facilities maintained by such exchange.” 15 USC § 78c(a)(1).
. Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) provides a functional test to assess whether a trading system meets the definition of exchange under Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) provides that an organization, association, or group of persons shall be considered to constitute, maintain, or provide “a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by an exchange” as those terms are used in Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act if such an organization, association, or group of persons: (1) brings together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers; and (2) uses established, non-discretionary methods (whether by providing a trading facility or by setting rules) under which such orders interact with each other, and the buyers and sellers entering such orders agree to the terms of the trade.^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_18[18])*^
. A system that meets the criteria of Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a), and is not excluded under Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(b), must register, pursuant to Section 5 of the Exchange Act, as a national securities exchange under Section 6 of the Exchange Act^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_19[19])*^ or operate pursuant to an appropriate exemption. One of the available exemptions is for alternative trading systems (“ATSs”).^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_20[20])*^ Exchange Act Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) exempts from the definition of “exchange” under Section 3(a)(1) an organization, association, or group of persons that complies with Regulation ATS.^*(xref:#coburn_footnote_21[21])*^ Regulation ATS requires an ATS to, among other things, register as a broker-dealer, file a Form ATS with the Commission to notice its operations, and establish written safeguards and procedures to protect subscribers’ confidential trading information. An ATS that complies with Regulation ATS and operates pursuant to the Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) exemption would not be required by Section 5 to register as a national securities exchange.
. EtherDelta satisfied the criteria of Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) and is not excluded under Rule 3b-16(b). During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta operated as a market place for bringing together the orders of multiple buyers and sellers in tokens that included securities as defined by Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act. The purchasers of such digital tokens invested money with a reasonable expectation of profits, including through the increased value of their investments in secondary trading, based on the managerial efforts of others. See DAO Report; SEC v. Edwards, 540 U.S. 389, 393 (2004); SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 301 (1946). As discussed above, EtherDelta brought together orders by receiving and storing orders in tokens in the EtherDelta order book and displaying the top 500 orders (including token symbol, size, and price) as bids and offers on the EtherDelta website. EtherDelta provided the means for these orders to interact and execute through the combined use of the EtherDelta website, order book, and pre-programmed trading protocols defined in the EtherDelta smart contract. These established non-discretionary methods allowed Users to agree upon the terms of their trades in tokens on EtherDelta during the Relevant Period.
. Despite operating as a Rule 3b-16(a) system, EtherDelta did not register as a national securities exchange or operate pursuant to an exemption from such registration. Accordingly, EtherDelta violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act. 

*B. Coburn Caused EtherDelta to Violate Section 5 of the Exchange Act*
[start=28] 
. During the relevant period, Coburn founded EtherDelta, wrote and deployed the EtherDelta smart contract to the Ethereum Blockchain, and exercised complete and sole control over EtherDelta’s operations, including over the operations constituting the violations described above. Coburn should have known that his actions would contribute to EtherDelta’s violations and thus, under Exchange Act Section 21C(a), caused EtherDelta to violate Section 5 of the Exchange Act.

[.text-center]
[underline]#Respondent’s Remedial Efforts#

[start=29]
. In determining to accept the Offer, including the decision not to impose a greater penalty, the Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Respondent and cooperation afforded the Commission staff. Coburn’s efforts facilitated the staff’s investigation involving an emerging technology. 

[.text-center]
*IV.*

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent’s Offer.

Accordingly, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, it is hereby ordered that:

[upperalpha]
. Respondent Coburn cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.
. Respondent Coburn shall pay disgorgement of $300,000 and prejudgment interest of $13,000, for a total of $313,000, to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the United States Treasury subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600.
. Respondent Coburn shall, within 10 days of this Order, pay a civil money penalty of $75,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the United States Treasury subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. §3717.
. Payments under this Order must be made in one of the following ways:
[arabic]
.. Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;
.. Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or
.. Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to: +
&emsp;&emsp;Enterprise Services Center +
&emsp;&emsp;Accounts Receivable Branch +
&emsp;&emsp;HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341 +
&emsp;&emsp;6500 South MacArthur Boulevard +
&emsp;&emsp;Oklahoma City, OK 73169 +
Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying Zachary Coburn as Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Robert A. Cohen, Chief, Cyber Unit, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549, or such other person or address as the Commission staff may provide.

. Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor Action, he shall not argue that he is entitled to, nor shall he benefit by, offset or reduction of any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset"). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that he shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor Action" means a private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this proceeding.
. Respondent acknowledges that the Commission is not imposing a civil penalty in excess of $75,000 based upon his cooperation in a Commission investigation and his agreement to testify in any related enforcement action. If at any time following the entry of the Order, the Division of Enforcement (“Division”) obtains information indicating that Respondent knowingly provided materially false or misleading information or materials to the Commission or in a related proceeding, the Division may, at its sole discretion and with prior notice to the Respondent, petition the Commission to reopen this matter and seek an order directing that the Respondent pay an additional civil penalty. Respondent may contest by way of defense in any resulting administrative proceeding whether he knowingly provided materially false or misleading information, but may not: (1) contest the findings in the Order; or (2) assert any defense to liability or remedy, including, but not limited to, any statute of limitations defense.

[.text-center]
*V.*

It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by Coburn, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other amounts due by Coburn under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by Coburn of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).

[2] An ICO is a term that describes the offer and sale of digital assets issued and distributed on a blockchain. A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, or peer-to-peer database spread across a network, that records all transactions in the network in theoretically unchangeable, digitally-recorded data packages called blocks. Each block contains a batch of records of transactions, including a timestamp and a reference to the previous block, linking the blocks together in a chain. The system relies on cryptographic techniques for secure recording of transactions. A blockchain can be shared and accessed by anyone with appropriate permissions. The Ethereum Blockchain is an open, or permissionless, blockchain that is a record of events resulting from the execution of code (smart contracts) on the Ethereum Blockchain. ERC20 refers to a specific Ethereum token issuing protocol, formally adopted by the Ethereum network in September 2017, and used on the Ethereum Blockchain. (ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comments and 20 is the unique identification used to distinguish this coding standard from other standards.) The ERC20 token standard, created in November 2015, “allows any token on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges” and “provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.” See Fabian Vogelsteller and Vitalik Buterin, ERC-20 Token Standard, November 19, 2015, https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md. The widespread adoption of the ERC20 token standard has also led developers to design applications, such as EtherDelta, that are compatible with any ERC20 token.

[3] Token pair refers to a trade between one digital asset and either another digital asset or fiat currency. On EtherDelta, the only token pairs available for trading were those between a particular ERC20 token and Ether.

[4] The term “market depth” refers to the number of open buy and sell orders for a particular token at different prices, and provides an indication of a particular token’s liquidity.

[[coburn_footnote_6]]
[6] A “smart contract” has been defined as: 

[.quoteblock]#a computerized transaction protocol that executes terms of a contract. The general objectives of smart contract design are to satisfy common contractual conditions (such as payment terms, liens, confidentiality, and even enforcement), minimize exceptions both malicious and accidental, and minimize the need for trusted intermediaries. Related economic goals include lowering fraud loss, arbitrations and enforcement costs, and other transaction costs.#

[7] A function is the name given to pieces of code or a group of programming statements for easy reference or use.

[[coburn_footnote_8]]
[8] Users who are nodes (or connected to nodes) on the Ethereum Blockchain can interact directly with the EtherDelta smart contract, which is publicly-available on github.com. Alternatively, during the Relevant Period, Users could interact with the EtherDelta smart contract through a user-friendly interface created by Coburn, called The EtherDelta Graphic User Interface (“EtherDelta GUI” or “website”) (accessible at the URL www.etherdelta.com). EtherDelta’s website, allowed Users to interact with the EtherDelta smart contract without having to be a node on the Ethereum Blockchain and without having to understand the details of blockchain technology.

[[coburn_footnote_9]]
[9] Only the person with access to the private key for the “administrator account” identified in the EtherDelta smart contract can alter the EtherDelta smart contract; this access was limited to changing the permissible fees or the address of the fee account. At all times during the Relevant Period, Coburn was the only person with access to that private key and therefore, was the only person that had the ability to alter the EtherDelta smart contract.

[[coburn_footnote_10]]
[10] Anyone can interact with the Ethereum Blockchain by transmitting a cryptographically-secured message to the Blockchain. That message can be “state-changing” in that it can request that a particular smart contract on the Ethereum Blockchain perform a certain function that results in a change of state of the Blockchain. A state-changing message is also referred to as a “Send.” Alternatively, a message can simply request information already written to the Blockchain, and not result in a change to the state of the Blockchain. That type of message is referred to as a “Call.” Any Send must first be validated and the resulting change of state recorded to the Blockchain by the “mining” activities of a network of Ethereum “miners,” which are computing nodes on the Blockchain. A Send generally requires the payment of “gas,” or a fee paid in Ether to the Ethereum miners. Generally (but not always), the speed at which a transaction is mined on the Ethereum Blockchain is determined by the amount of gas paid by the sender of a transaction to the mining network; the higher the gas price paid for the transaction, the faster a transaction is likely to be mined. The gas price is set by the sender at the time the message is sent to the network.

[[coburn_footnote_11]]
[11] A market order is an order to buy or sell a stock at the best available price.

==== Discussion Questions ====

. Is it fair that Coburn was still required by the SEC to pay a fine for his time running EtherDelta even though he sold EtherDelta prior to the settlement.  
. If Coburn had just created a smart contract on the blockchain enabling trading of ERC20 tokens and had not created a centralized off chain trading pairs website, would he have still violated the SEC's interpretation of the securities laws?

*Remarks at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit: Crypto*

Thank you Andy. I am pleased to be here today. This event provides a great opportunity to address a topic that is the subject of considerable debate in the press and in the crypto-community -- whether a digital asset offered as a security can, over time, become something other than a security.

To start, we should frame the question differently and focus not on the digital asset itself, but on the circumstances surrounding the digital asset and the manner in which it is sold. To that end, a better line of inquiry is: “Can a digital asset that was originally offered in a securities offering ever be later sold in a manner that does not constitute an offering of a security?” In cases where the digital asset represents a set of rights that gives the holder a financial interest in an enterprise, the answer is likely “no.” In these cases, calling the transaction an initial coin offering, or “ICO,” or a sale of a “token,” will not take it out of the purview of the U.S. securities laws.

But what about cases where there is no longer any central enterprise being invested in or where the digital asset is sold only to be used to purchase a good or service available through the network on which it was created? I believe in these cases the answer is a qualified “yes.” I would like to share my thinking with you today about the circumstances under which that could occur.

Before I turn to the securities law analysis, let me share what I believe may be most exciting about distributed ledger technology -- that is, the potential to share information, transfer value, and record transactions in a decentralized digital environment. Potential applications include supply chain management, intellectual property rights licensing, stock ownership transfers and countless others. There is real value in creating applications that can be accessed and executed electronically with a public, immutable record and without the need for a trusted third party to verify transactions. Some people believe that this technology will transform e-commerce as we know it. There is excitement and a great deal of speculative interest around this new technology. Unfortunately, there also are cases of fraud. In many regards, it is still “early days.”

But I am not here to discuss the promise of technology -- there are many in attendance and speaking here today that can do a much better job of that. I would like to focus on the application of the federal securities laws to digital asset transactions -- that is how tokens and coins are being issued, distributed and sold. While perhaps a bit dryer than the promise of the blockchain, this topic is critical to the broader acceptance and use of these novel instruments.

I will begin by describing what I often see. Promoters, in order to raise money to develop networks on which digital assets will operate, often sell the tokens or coins rather than sell shares, issue notes or obtain bank financing. But, in many cases, the economic substance is the same as a conventional securities offering. Funds are raised with the expectation that the promoters will build their system and investors can earn a return on the instrument -- usually by selling their tokens in the secondary market once the promoters create something of value with the proceeds and the value of the digital enterprise increases.

When we see that kind of economic transaction, it is easy to apply the Supreme Court's “investment contract” test first announced in SEC v. Howey. That test requires an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others. And it is important to reflect on the facts of Howey. A hotel operator sold interests in a citrus grove to its guests and claimed it was selling real estate, not securities. While the transaction was recorded as a real estate sale, it also included a service contract to cultivate and harvest the oranges. The purchasers could have arranged to service the grove themselves but, in fact, most were passive, relying on the efforts of Howey-in-the-Hills Service, Inc. for a return. In articulating the test for an investment contract, the Supreme Court stressed: “Form [is] disregarded for substance and the emphasis [is] placed upon economic reality.” So the purported real estate purchase was found to be an investment contract -- an investment in orange groves was in these circumstances an investment in a security.

Just as in the Howey case, tokens and coins are often touted as assets that have a use in their own right, coupled with a promise that the assets will be cultivated in a way that will cause them to grow in value, to be sold later at a profit. And, as in Howey -- where interests in the groves were sold to hotel guests, not farmers -- tokens and coins typically are sold to a wide audience rather than to persons who are likely to use them on the network.

In the ICOs I have seen, overwhelmingly, promoters tout their ability to create an innovative application of blockchain technology. Like in Howey, the investors are passive. Marketing efforts are rarely narrowly targeted to token users. And typically at the outset, the business model and very viability of the application is still uncertain. The purchaser usually has no choice but to rely on the efforts of the promoter to build the network and make the enterprise a success. At that stage, the purchase of a token looks a lot like a bet on the success of the enterprise and not the purchase of something used to exchange for goods or services on the network.

As an aside, you might ask, given that these token sales often look like securities offerings, why are the promoters choosing to package the investment as a coin or token offering? This is an especially good question if the network on which the token or coin will function is not yet operational. I think there can be a number of reasons. For a while, some believed such labeling might, by itself, remove the transaction from the securities laws. I think people now realize labeling an investment opportunity as a coin or token does not achieve that result. Second, this labeling might have been used to bring some marketing “sizzle” to the enterprise. That might still work to some extent, but the track record of ICOs is still being sorted out and some of that sizzle may now be more of a potential warning flare for investors.

Some may be attracted to a blockchain-mediated crowdfunding process. Digital assets can represent an efficient way to reach a global audience where initial purchasers have a stake in the success of the network and become part of a network where their participation adds value beyond their investment contributions. The digital assets are then exchanged -- for some, to help find the market price for the new application; for others, to speculate on the venture. As I will discuss, whether a transaction in a coin or token on the secondary market amounts to an offer or sale of a security requires a careful and fact-sensitive legal analysis.

I believe some industry participants are beginning to realize that, in some circumstances, it might be easier to start a blockchain-based enterprise in a more conventional way. In other words, conduct the initial funding through a registered or exempt equity or debt offering and, once the network is up and running, distribute or offer blockchain-based tokens or coins to participants who need the functionality the network and the digital assets offer. This allows the tokens or coins to be structured and offered in a way where it is evident that purchasers are not making an investment in the development of the enterprise.

Returning to the ICOs I am seeing, strictly speaking, the token -- or coin or whatever the digital information packet is called -- all by itself is not a security, just as the orange groves in Howey were not. Central to determining whether a security is being sold is how it is being sold and the reasonable expectations of purchasers. When someone buys a housing unit to live in, it is probably not a security. But under certain circumstances, the same asset can be offered and sold in a way that causes investors to have a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others. For example, if the housing unit is offered with a management contract or other services, it can be a security. Similarly, when a CD, exempt from being treated as a security under Section 3 of the Securities Act, is sold as a part of a program organized by a broker who offers retail investors promises of liquidity and the potential to profit from changes in interest rates, the Gary Plastic case teaches us that the instrument can be part of an investment contract that is a security.

The same reasoning applies to digital assets. The digital asset itself is simply code. But the way it is sold -- as part of an investment; to non-users; by promoters to develop the enterprise -- can be, and, in that context, most often is, a security -- because it evidences an investment contract. And regulating these transactions as securities transactions makes sense. The impetus of the Securities Act is to remove the information asymmetry between promoters and investors. In a public distribution, the Securities Act prescribes the information investors need to make an informed investment decision, and the promoter is liable for material misstatements in the offering materials. These are important safeguards, and they are appropriate for most ICOs. The disclosures required under the federal securities laws nicely complement the Howey investment contract element about the efforts of others. As an investor, the success of the enterprise -- and the ability to realize a profit on the investment -- turns on the efforts of the third party. So learning material information about the third party -- its background, financing, plans, financial stake and so forth -- is a prerequisite to making an informed investment decision. Without a regulatory framework that promotes disclosure of what the third party alone knows of these topics and the risks associated with the venture, investors will be uninformed and are at risk.

But this also points the way to when a digital asset transaction may no longer represent a security offering. If the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized -- where purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts -- the assets may not represent an investment contract. Moreover, when the efforts of the third party are no longer a key factor for determining the enterprise's success, material information asymmetries recede. As a network becomes truly decentralized, the ability to identify an issuer or promoter to make the requisite disclosures becomes difficult, and less meaningful.

And so, when I look at Bitcoin today, I do not see a central third party whose efforts are a key determining factor in the enterprise. The network on which Bitcoin functions is operational and appears to have been decentralized for some time, perhaps from inception. Applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to the offer and resale of Bitcoin would seem to add little value. And putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. And, as with Bitcoin, applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to current transactions in Ether would seem to add little value. Over time, there may be other sufficiently decentralized networks and systems where regulating the tokens or coins that function on them as securities may not be required. And of course there will continue to be systems that rely on central actors whose efforts are a key to the success of the enterprise. In those cases, application of the securities laws protects the investors who purchase the tokens or coins.

I would like to emphasize that the analysis of whether something is a security is not static and does not strictly inhere to the instrument. Even digital assets with utility that function solely as a means of exchange in a decentralized network could be packaged and sold as an investment strategy that can be a security. If a promoter were to place Bitcoin in a fund or trust and sell interests, it would create a new security. Similarly, investment contracts can be made out of virtually any asset (including virtual assets), provided the investor is reasonably expecting profits from the promoter's efforts.

Let me emphasize an earlier point: simply labeling a digital asset a “utility token” does not turn the asset into something that is not a security. I recognize that the Supreme Court has acknowledged that if someone is purchasing an asset for consumption only, it is likely not a security. But, the economic substance of the transaction always determines the legal analysis, not the labels. The oranges in Howey had utility. Or in my favorite example, the Commission warned in the late 1960s about investment contracts sold in the form of whisky warehouse receipts. Promoters sold the receipts to U.S. investors to finance the aging and blending processes of Scotch whisky. The whisky was real -- and, for some, had exquisite utility. But Howey was not selling oranges and the warehouse receipts promoters were not selling whisky for consumption. They were selling investments, and the purchasers were expecting a return from the promoters' efforts.

Promoters and other market participants need to understand whether transactions in a particular digital asset involve the sale of a security. We are happy to help promoters and their counsel work through these issues. We stand prepared to provide more formal interpretive or no-action guidance about the proper characterization of a digital asset in a proposed use. In addition, we recognize that there are numerous implications under the federal securities laws of a particular asset being considered a security. For example, our Divisions of Trading and Markets and Investment Management are focused on such issues as broker-dealer, exchange and fund registration, as well as matters of market manipulation, custody and valuation. We understand that market participants are working to make their services compliant with the existing regulatory framework, and we are happy to continue our engagement in this process.

What are some of the factors to consider in assessing whether a digital asset is offered as an investment contract and is thus a security? Primarily, consider whether a third party -- be it a person, entity or coordinated group of actors -- drives the expectation of a return. That question will always depend on the particular facts and circumstances, and this list is illustrative, not exhaustive:

    . Is there a person or group that has sponsored or promoted the creation and sale of the digital asset, the efforts of whom play a significant role in the development and maintenance of the asset and its potential increase in value?
    . Has this person or group retained a stake or other interest in the digital asset such that it would be motivated to expend efforts to cause an increase in value in the digital asset? Would purchasers reasonably believe such efforts will be undertaken and may result in a return on their investment in the digital asset?
    . Has the promoter raised an amount of funds in excess of what may be needed to establish a functional network, and, if so, has it indicated how those funds may be used to support the value of the tokens or to increase the value of the enterprise? Does the promoter continue to expend funds from proceeds or operations to enhance the functionality and/or value of the system within which the tokens operate?
    . Are purchasers “investing,” that is seeking a return? In that regard, is the instrument marketed and sold to the general public instead of to potential users of the network for a price that reasonably correlates with the market value of the good or service in the network?
    . Does application of the Securities Act protections make sense? Is there a person or entity others are relying on that plays a key role in the profit-making of the enterprise such that disclosure of their activities and plans would be important to investors? Do informational asymmetries exist between the promoters and potential purchasers/investors in the digital asset?
    . Do persons or entities other than the promoter exercise governance rights or meaningful influence?

While these factors are important in analyzing the role of any third party, there are contractual or technical ways to structure digital assets so they function more like a consumer item and less like a security. Again, we would look to the economic substance of the transaction, but promoters and their counsels should consider these, and other, possible features. This list is not intended to be exhaustive and by no means do I believe each and every one of these factors needs to be present to establish a case that a token is not being offered as a security. This list is meant to prompt thinking by promoters and their counsel, and start the dialogue with the staff -- it is not meant to be a list of all necessary factors in a legal analysis.

. Is token creation commensurate with meeting the needs of users or, rather, with feeding speculation?
. Are independent actors setting the price or is the promoter supporting the secondary market for the asset or otherwise influencing trading?
. Is it clear that the primary motivation for purchasing the digital asset is for personal use or consumption, as compared to investment? Have purchasers made representations as to their consumptive, as opposed to their investment, intent? Are the tokens available in increments that correlate with a consumptive versus investment intent?
. Are the tokens distributed in ways to meet users' needs? For example, can the tokens be held or transferred only in amounts that correspond to a purchaser's expected use? Are there built-in incentives that compel using the tokens promptly on the network, such as having the tokens degrade in value over time, or can the tokens be held for extended periods for investment?
. Is the asset marketed and distributed to potential users or the general public?
. Are the assets dispersed across a diverse user base or concentrated in the hands of a few that can exert influence over the application?
. Is the application fully functioning or in early stages of development?


These are exciting legal times and I am pleased to be part of a process that can help promoters of this new technology and their counsel navigate and comply with the federal securities laws.

==== Discussion Questions ====

. Is a digital asset a security under the Howey test, or is the transaction of sale for the digital asset an investment contract under the Howey test?
. Bill Hinman stated that he wanted to discuss when a token that is originally created as a security is no longer a security.  Does this phrasing make sense to you?  Does this transition make sense?

Re: &emsp;&emsp; TurnKey Jet, Inc. +
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Incoming letter dated April 2, 2019

Based on the facts presented, the Division will not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if, in reliance on your opinion as counsel that the Tokens are not securities, TKJ offers and sells the Tokens without registration under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Capitalized terms have the same meanings as defined in your letter.

In reaching this position, we particularly note that:

* TKJ will not use any funds from Token sales to develop the TKJ Platform, Network, or App, and each of these will be fully developed and operational at the time any Tokens are sold;
* the Tokens will be immediately usable for their intended functionality (purchasing air charter services) at the time they are sold;
* TKJ will restrict transfers of Tokens to TKJ Wallets only, and not to wallets external to the Platform;
* TKJ will sell Tokens at a price of one USD per Token throughout the life of the Program, and each Token will represent a TKJ obligation to supply air charter services at a value of one USD per Token;
* If TKJ offers to repurchase Tokens, it will only do so at a discount to the face value of the Tokens (one USD per Token) that the holder seeks to resell to TKJ, unless a court within the United States orders TKJ to liquidate the Tokens; and
* The Token is marketed in a manner that emphasizes the functionality of the Token, and not the potential for the increase in the market value of the Token.

This position is based on the representations made to the Division in your letter. Any different facts or conditions might require the Division to reach a different conclusion. Further, this response expresses the Division's position on enforcement action only and does not express any legal conclusion on the question presented.

[underline]#**MEMORANDUM AND ORDER**#

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contends that LBRY, Inc. offered and sold unregistered securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. LBRY responds that it does not need to comply with the Securities Act because its alleged security, a blockchain token called LBC, is not a security at all. Instead, it argues that LBC functions as a digital currency that is an essential component of the LBRY Blockchain. LBRY also asserts that the SEC's attempt to treat LBC as a security violates its right to due process because the agency did not give LBRY fair notice that its offerings of LBC are subject to the securities laws. The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment addressing both issues

*I&period; [underline]#BACKGROUND#*
[.text-justify]
The nascent technology known as blockchain operates in the background of this dispute. From its earliest days, proponents of blockchain technology have envisioned it as fundamentally altering many aspects of modern life. See Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (2008), https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf[] (outlining the idea for a peer-to-peer electronic payment system). As LBRY explains, a blockchain is essentially a “decentralized ledger maintained by a network of independently owned computers.” See Kauffman Decl., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Doc. No. 61-3] at 2 ¶ 5. Verified data is held in decentralized “block[s]” linked together via cryptographic consensus protocols.

A. The Development of the LBRY Network

LBRY began as an effort to harness blockchain technology to allow users to share videos, images, and other digital content without a centralized host such as YouTube. [underline]#See# Def.'s Mem., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791680[Doc. No. 61-1] at 3.

It is used to compensate miners, but it can also be spent on the LBRY Blockchain to publish content, create “channel[s]” that associate content with a single user, tip content creators, purchase paywall content, or “boost[]” channels or content in search results. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[id.] at 5-6 ¶ 17.

It then sorted its LBC into three buckets: (1) 200 million into a “Community Fund,” to be used for “spreading usage and adoption” of the Network by “rewarding early adopters,” “recruiting producers,” and “rewarding contributors to the community”; (2) 100 million into an “Institutional Fund,” to allow for “the formation of institutional partnerships, as well as for grants and donations to nonprofits and other [NGOs] with similar values as LBRY”; and (3) 100 million into the aptly named “Operational Fund,” to be used for “operational purposes.” [underline]#See# Kauffman Decl., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Doc.

To establish a prima facie violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act, the SEC must prove that LBRY offered or sold securities in interstate commerce without filing a registration statement. [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iedab2640c58d11ecbf45df569f0c2bfa/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_8173_939++[SEC v.

Kahlon, 873 F.3d 500, 504 (5th Cir. 2017)]. LBRY does not challenge the SEC's contention that it offered and sold LBC in interstate commerce without registering its offerings with the SEC. Nor does it argue that its past offerings fall within an exemption to the registration requirement. Thus, the only issues impeding a finding that LBRY violated Section 5 are LBRY's claim that it did not offer LBC as a security and its argument that it was not given fair notice that it needed to register its offerings. I address each issue in turn.

Here, only the third component of the Howey test is in dispute.

I analyze the evidence that bears on this issue by first examining LBRY's representations to prospective purchasers and the company's business model. I then turn to LBRY's argument that it has not offered LBC as a security because some purchasers acquired LBC for use on the LBRY Network.

1&period; LBRY's Representations to Potential Purchasers 

[.text-justify]
The SEC identifies multiple statements by LBRY that it claims led potential investors to reasonably expect that LBC would grow in value as the company continued to oversee the development of the LBRY Network. LBRY minimizes the significance of these statements, and points to its many disclaimers that it did not intend for LBC to be purchased as an investment, but the SEC is correct. LBRY has - at key moments and despite its protestations - been acutely aware of LBC's potential value as an investment. And it made sure potential investors were too. 
[.text-justify]
When LBRY launched the LBRY Network in June 2016, LBC's market capitalization was a healthy $140 million. [underline]#See# 7/15/2016 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[Doc. No. 57-11]. This, despite the Network's relative infancy and limited usability. By the following month, LBC's market capitalization had ballooned to $1.2 billion. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[Id.] In response, LBRY issued a blog post reflecting on LBC's skyrocketing value. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] 
[.text-justify]
LBRY captioned the post: “1.2B Market Cap and We Don't Care.” Id. It began by touting the rapid growth in LBC's value, but frankly acknowledged that it could not say whether the current valuation was justified. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] At that point, only three videos were available on the blockchain, each produced by LBRY itself. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] And LBRY's staff were hard at work “frantically debugging” and developing its product. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] What LBRY did claim to know though was “that the long-term value proposition of LBRY is tremendous, but also dependent on our team staying focused on the task at hand: building this thing.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] It then closed the post by announcing a policy of neutrality with respect to LBC's price but plainly stating that “[o]ver the long-term, the interests of LBRY and the holders of [LBC] are aligned.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] 
[.text-justify]
In August 2016, the COO of LBRY, Josh Finer, emailed a potential investor explaining that the company was “currently negotiating private placements of LBC with several [other] investors” and asked the recipient to write him back “if there is interest” so the two could “chat.” [underline]#See# COO Email, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[Doc.

[underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[id.] After briefly noting that the platform was up and running, the COO explained how LBC are being traded on “major crypto exchanges” and that trading volume is moving at a healthy clip. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[id.] The “opportunity is obvious,” wrote the COO, “buy a bunch of credits, put them away safely, and hope that in 1-3 years we've appreciated even 10% of how much Bitcoin has in the past few years.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[id.] He wraps up by pitching LBRY's commitment to building its Network: “[i]f our product has the utility we plan, the credits should appreciate accordingly.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[id.] 
[.text-justify]
By November 2016, LBC's price was down, and some LBC investors were getting jittery. Jeremy Kauffman, LBRY's CEO, published a blog post titled “Acryptypical: The CEO of LBRY on the price of LBC,” outlining his view of LBRY's condition and providing “a canonical answer to questions about the price of LBC.” [underline]#See# 11/15/2016 Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[Doc. No. 57-21]. LBC's price was low, he contended, because of simple economics: the supply of LBC entering circulation through mining was outpacing the demand for new tokens. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] And demand was low because, at that point, “there [was] no reason to buy” LBC. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] When LBRY launched, Kauffman explained, it was “the barest, minimum proof-of-concept [application] possible.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] 
[.text-justify]
Although it had only been a few months since the launch, LBRY still stressed its long-term goal of “buil[ding] a product that is compelling enough to change people's habits,” replacing “YouTube” and “Amazon.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] And while investors were unlikely to make a “quick buck,” Kauffman encouraged them to “hold onto [their LBC] (or spend it to buy some of [LBRY's] great content . . . .).” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] LBRY's message was clear: We are a work in progress. LBC reflects that. Bear with us.  
[.text-justify]
In another communication, this time on Reddit, a user who was “trying to do ++[their]++ research before putting in ++[their]++ money” asked some general questions about how LBRY would manage its holdings of LBC. [underline]#See# Reddit Thread, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791462[Doc. No. 57-20].

Vine explained how the future “value of LBRY credits” would depend on “the success of our media marketplace.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791461[id.] When the interviewer asked how LBRY would keep “stolen[,] . . . unsavory, or downright illegal” content from the protocol, Vine's response betrayed LBRY's powerbroking role within its ecosystem by explaining that LBRY might be able to use its “position as the ‘market maker’ of [LBC] to basically make it more expensive for people to abuse the network.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791461[id.]  
[.text-justify]
In January 2018, Kauffman wrote further on the benefits of blockchain technology in another essay entitled “Blockchain is Love, Blockchain is Life.” 
[underline]#See# 1/10/2018 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[Doc. No. 57-16]. There, he wrote about what he called the “incentive problem[]” in developing open-source alternatives to existing technologies that are controlled by private companies. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[id.] One solution to this problem, as Kauffman saw it, was to be found in blockchain technology, which allowed for blockchain tokens to be used to realign incentives. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[id.] Because a blockchain token “has value in proportion to the usage and success of the network,” developers are incentivized to work to develop and promote new uses for blockchain. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[Id.] As Kauffman put it: 
[.text-justify]
[.quoteblock]#`_"It means that the people who discover and utilize a new protocol or network when it's just getting off the ground can reap substantial value by being there first. This solves the incentive problems around being a first-mover and softens the pain of using a service that probably won't be as feature-rich or slick as established competitors' options. It provides a source of funding for the development of the protocol. The creators can use the token to pay for the salaries and equipment required to get it started."_`#

link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[Id.] 

[.text-justify]
And in yet another post, this time in October 2020, LBRY provided another positive update. [underline]#See# 10/14/2020 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[Doc. No. 57-24]. It explained that it still saw itself as meeting the consumer “demand for a userowned and controlled alternative to YouTube and big tech.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[id.] Indeed, its work creating a “compelling token economy centered around digital content exchange” was still “imminently achievable” with just “some tweaks.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[id.] LBRY also touted the enormous potential it saw in continuing to develop its application on its blockchain. Other blockchain companies, the post asserted, are forced to rely on “some third-party” to “magicly [sic] build a world-class application” on their blockchains. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[id.] Not LBRY. And since “[a]pplications used by billions of people can be worth trillions of dollars,” LBRY was uniquely poised to “deliver that value” by “own[ing] the whole stack.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[id.]  
[.text-justify]
These statements are representative of LBRY's overall messaging about the growth potential for LBC, and thus the SEC is correct that potential investors would understand that LBRY was pitching a speculative value proposition for its digital token. LBRY's messaging amounts to precisely the “not-very-subtle form of economic inducement” the First Circuit identified in [underline]#SG# as evidencing [underline]#Howey's# “expectation of profits.” [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I13202b1079bf11d9ac1ffa9f33b6c3b0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_54++[SG Ltd., 265 F.3d at 54-55]. 
[.text-justify]
LBRY does not disavow its statements regarding LBC's value or price, but notes that the statements the SEC identifies constitute only 0.25% of “the total number of posts and messages the company has published since its inception.” [underline]#See# Def.'s Obj., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845[Doc. No. 74] at 5. But this statistic relies on a misleading denominator. Of course, like many other companies, LBRY regularly publishes statements on a range of topics, and could not argue that the 8,805 tweets it identified having posted, [underline]#see# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845[id.], all pertain in equal measure to its views of LBC's long-term value proposition. Since LBRY makes no effort to tally the number of comparable statements to those identified by the SEC, its argument lacks weight.  
[.text-justify]
LBRY also relies on the fact that it informed some potential purchasers of LBC that the company was not offering its token as an investment. But a disclaimer cannot undo the objective economic realities of a transaction. [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I4ba864e06e4411eaafc9a4147037e074/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_7903_365++[SEC v. Telegram Grp. Inc., 448 F. Supp.3d 352, 365 (S.D.N.Y. 2020)] (citing link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I13202b1079bf11d9ac1ffa9f33b6c3b0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_54++[SG Ltd., 265 F.3d] at 54) (“Disclaimers, if contrary to the apparent economic reality of a transaction, may be considered by the [c]ourt but are not dispositive.”). 

[.text-justify] 
2&period; LBRY's Business Model 

[.text-justify]
As I just laid out, LBRY made no secret in its communications with potential investors that it expected LBC to grow in value through its managerial and entrepreneurial efforts. But even if it had never explicitly broadcast its views on the subject, any reasonable investor who was familiar with the company's business model would have understood the connection. 
[.text-justify]
From its inception, LBRY's profitability turned on its ability to grow the value of LBC by increasing usage of the LBRY Network. As Kauffman explained in an October 2016 informal business plan, LBC was the means by which LBRY and other early adopters would be able to profit as use of the network increased. [underline]#See# LBRY Plan, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030[Doc. No. 62-2] at 9. This was because “[e]ach percentage of [LBC] can be thought of as having a value proportional to the sum of all information transacted through the network.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030[Id.] In other words, as demand for information stored on the blockchain increased, so too would LBC's value. Accordingly, Kauffman reasoned, “[g]iven this situation, the most reasonable path to profit is to reserve a portion of the cryptocurrency.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030[Id.] Later in the same plan, he discussed the company's liquidation value by stating “[s]ince LBRY's most significant asset will be its credits, it could simply liquify these credits at a return of 10-10,000x on any investment.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030[Id.] at 10. 
[.text-justify]
Similarly, in a post on its website titled “Answers to Big Questions From our Reddit AMA,” LBRY responded to the question “How does the company behind LBRY make money?” by stating:  
[.text-justify]
[.quoteblock]#`_"The LBRY protocol has a built-in digital currency that allows it to function, called LBRY Credits. These Credits are very similar to bitcoins. Having a built-in digital currency creates an opportunity for a new kind of business that has never existed: the protocol first enterprise . . . LBRY Inc. has reserved 10% of all LBRY Credits to fund continued development and provide profit for the founders. Since Credits only gain value as the use of the protocol grows, the company has an incentive to continue developing this open-source project."_`# 

9/28/2016 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791450[Doc. No. 57-8]. +

[.text-justify]
The problem for LBRY is not just that a reasonable purchaser of LBC would understand that the tokens being offered represented investment opportunities - even if LBRY never said a word about it. It is that, by retaining hundreds of millions of LBC for itself, LBRY also signaled that it was motivated to work tirelessly to improve the value of its blockchain for itself and any LBC purchasers. This structure, which any reasonable purchaser would understand, would lead purchasers of LBC to expect that they too would profit from their holdings of LBC as a result of LBRY's assiduous efforts. 

[.text-justify]
Simply put, by intertwining LBRY's financial fate with the commercial success of LBC, LBRY made it obvious to its investors that it would work diligently to develop the Network so that LBC would increase in value. As LBRY said, “[o]ver the long-term, the interests of LBRY and the holders of Credits are aligned.” [underline]#See# 7/15/2016 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[Doc. No. 57-11]. The SEC's burden is made all the easier by statements LBRY made about its managerial efforts, like how “the long-term value proposition of LBRY is . . . dependent on our team staying focused on the task at hand: building this thing.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] By its own account, LBRY expended significant managerial efforts to develop its Network and increase the value of LBC.

3&period; Consumptive Uses for LBC 

[.text-justify]
LBRY's primary response to the SEC's claim starts with two generally uncontested facts: (1) LBC is a utility token designed for use on the LBRY Blockchain, and (2) some unknown number of purchasers of LBC acquired it at least in part with the intention of using it rather than holding it as an investment. Building from there, LBRY leaps to the conclusion that LBC cannot be a security even if LBRY offered it as an investment. LBRY is mistaken about both the facts and the law. 
[.text-justify]
Nothing in the case law suggests that a token with both consumptive and speculative uses cannot be sold as an investment contract. Despite LBRY's insistence to the contrary, I cannot reject the SEC's contention that LBRY offered LBC as a security simply because some LBC purchases were made with consumptive intent. Were it otherwise, the Securities Act would be unable to adapt to the “countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits” wherever a token held some consumptive utility. [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I22292b4f9bf011d993e6d35cc61aab4a/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_780_299++[Howey, 328 U.S.] at 299. 
Accordingly, statements from a subset of LBC holders that they purchased LBC for use on the LBRY Blockchain is of limited relevance in determining whether LBRY offered it as a security. [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I14265fa660e511deb08de1b7506ad85b/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_1021++[Warfield, 569 F.3d] at 1021 (“[W]hile the subjective intent of the purchasers may have some bearing on the issue of whether they entered into investment contracts, we must focus our inquiry on what the purchasers were offered or promised.”). 
[.text-justify]
In summary, what the evidence in the record discloses is that LBRY promoted LBC as an investment that would grow in value over time through the company's development of the LBRY Network. While some unknown number of purchasers may have acquired LBC in part for consumptive purposes, this does not change the fact that the objective economic realities of LBRY's offerings of LBC establish that it was offering it as a security.^*(xref:#sec_v_lbry_footnote_4[4])*^ 
 
B&period; Did LBRY Receive Fair Notice? 
[.text-justify]
LBRY argues that I should nonetheless deny the SEC's motion because it did not receive fair notice that its offerings were subject to the securities laws. In pressing this argument, LBRY has abandoned any broad claim that it lacked fair notice of the way in which the [underline]#Howey# test applies to digital tokens in general. Def.'s Obj., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845[Doc. No. 74] at 24. Instead, it complains that it lacked fair notice because, until the SEC brought this action, “the Commission historically and consistently focused its guidance, as well as its enforcement efforts, exclusively on the issuance of digital assets in the context of an [Initial Coin Offering] ICO.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845[Id.] 
[.text-justify]
The principal problem with LBRY's fair notice argument is that it offers nothing more to support its position than its bald claim that this is the first case in which the SEC has attempted to enforce the registration requirement against an issuer of digital tokens that did not conduct an ICO.
[.text-justify]
LBRY does not point to any specific statement by the SEC suggesting that companies need only comply with the registration requirement if they conduct an ICO. Nor does LBRY offer any persuasive reading of [underline]#Howey# that would cause a reasonable issuer to conclude that only ICOs are subject to the registration requirement. The test outlined in [underline]#Howey# is necessarily a fact specific one, in which no single fact will likely be dispositive. While participation in an ICO may be relevant to the analysis, it will not determine the outcome in a case like this, where the undisputed evidence leaves no doubt that LBRY offered and sold LBC as a security.  
[.text-justify]
LBRY relies on the Second Circuit's decision in [underline]#Upton v. SEC# for the proposition that the SEC may not impose a sanction for violating the securities laws “pursuant to a substantial change in its enforcement policy that was not reasonably communicated to the public.” [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_98++[75 F.3d 92, 98 (2nd Cir. 1996)]. But, as the SEC notes, the facts of [underline]#Upton# bear no resemblance to the present case. [underline]#Upton# involved an attempt by the SEC to sanction the CFO of a brokerage firm for violating an SEC rule that established a formula for setting the amount of money that the brokerage was required to maintain in a customer reserve account. link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_93++[Id.] at 93. Although it was undisputed that the brokerage had at all times complied with the “literal terms” of the rule, an administrative law judge relied on a novel interpretation of the rule by the SEC to conclude that the CFO could be sanctioned. link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_94++[Id.] at 94-96. Because the SEC did not give public notice of its new interpretation until after the brokerage had ended its offensive practice, the Second Circuit vacated the sanction imposed by the Commission. link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_94++[Id.] at 98. 
[.text-justify]
The present case is obviously quite different from the problem the court confronted in [underline]#Upton#. The SEC has not based its enforcement action here on a novel interpretation of a rule that by its terms does not expressly prohibit the relevant conduct. Instead, the SEC has based its claim on a straightforward application of a venerable Supreme Court precedent that has been applied by hundreds of federal courts across the country over more than 70 years. While this may be the first time it has been used against an issuer of digital tokens that did not conduct an ICO, LBRY is in no position to claim that it did not receive fair notice that its conduct was unlawful. 

[.text-center]
*IV&period; [underline]#CONCLUSION#*

[.text-justify]
As I have explained, the only issues raised by the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment are whether LBRY offered LBC as a security and whether LBRY received fair notice that it needed to register its offerings. Because no reasonable trier of fact could reject the SEC's contention that LBRY offered LBC as a security, and LBRY does not have a triable defense that it lacked fair notice, the SEC is entitled to judgment. The SEC's Motion for Summary Judgment (link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791412[Doc. No. 55]) is granted, and LBRY's Motion for Summary Judgment (link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791679[Doc. No. 61]) is denied. The Clerk shall schedule a status conference to discuss the process for resolving any remaining issues.

==== Discussion Questions ====

. In LBRY, some of the token purchases were made with consumptive intent and some token purchases were made with investment intent, does the proportion of the purchases for investment vs. consumption matter for the Howey test?  
. Would it make a difference for the Howey test if there were other organizations beyond LBRY promoting the LBC token?  
. Could LBRY have applied Bill Hinman's reasoning to argue that even though LBC was originally a security, it was no longer a security by the time of the SEC action, similar to Ethereum?

ANALISA TORRES, District Judge:

[.text-justify]
Plaintiff, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), brings this action against Defendants Ripple Labs, Inc. (“Ripple”) and two of its senior leaders, Bradley Garlinghouse and Christian A. Larsen, alleging that Defendants engaged in the unlawful offer and sale of securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and (c). Am. Compl. ¶¶ 9, 430–35, ECF No. 46. The SEC also alleges that Garlinghouse and Larsen aided and abetted Ripple’s Section 5 violations. _Id._ ¶¶ 9, 436–40.
[.text-justify]
Before the Court are the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment. ECF Nos. 824, 836; _see also_ ECF Nos. 621, 625, 639, 642.^*(xref:sec_ripple_footnote_1[1])*^  For the reasons stated below, the SEC’s motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, and Defendants’ motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.

*BACKGROUND*^*(xref:sec_ripple_footnote_2[2])*^

&emsp;I&period;&emsp; [underline]#Factual Background#

&emsp;&emsp;A&period; Development of the XRP Ledger and the Founding of Ripple

[.text-justify]
In 2011 and early 2012, Arthur Britto, Jed McCaleb, and David Schwartz developed the source code for a cryptographically secured ledger, or a “blockchain,”^*(xref:sec_ripple_footnote_3[3])*^ which is now known as the XRP Ledger. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 11, ECF No. 842; _see also_ ECF No. 668. They aimed to create a faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient alternative to the bitcoin blockchain, the first blockchain ledger which was introduced in 2009. _Id._ ¶¶ 4, 12. When the XRP Ledger launched in 2012, its source code generated a fixed supply of 100 billion XRP. _Id._ ¶¶ 17–18. XRP is the native digital token of the XRP Ledger, and the XRP Ledger requires XRP to operate. _Id._ ¶¶ 13–14. Each unit of XRP is divisible into one million “drops,” and each unit or drop of XRP is fungible with any other unit or drop. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 17–18, ECF No. 835; _see also_ ECF No. 663.

[.text-justify]
In 2012, Britto, Defendant Larsen, and McCaleb founded Ripple.^*(xref:sec_ripple_footnote_4[4])*^ _Id._ ¶ 41; SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 32. Larsen became Ripple’s CEO, a position he held until December 2016. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 41. Of the 100 billion XRP generated by the XRP Ledger’s code, the three founders retained 20 billion for themselves (including 9 billion for Larsen) and provided 80 billion XRP to Ripple. _Id._ ¶ 15; SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 21. The founders did not sell any XRP before the launch of the XRP Ledger, and Ripple never owned the 20 billion XRP retained by the three founders. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 20, 22.

Since its founding, Ripple’s mission has been to realize an “Internet of Value” by using technology to facilitate the transfer of value across the internet. _Id._ ¶ 35. Specifically, Ripple “seeks to modernize international payments by developing a global payments network for international currency transfers.” _Id._ For instance, Ripple developed a software product called RippleNet, which allows customers to clear and settle cross-border financial transactions on mutually agreed upon terms. _Id._ ¶ 41. One feature of RippleNet is known as “on demand liquidity” (“ODL”). _Id._ ¶ 45. ODL facilitates cross-border transactions by allowing customers to exchange fiat currency (for example, U.S. dollars) for XRP and then the XRP for another fiat currency (for example, Mexican pesos). _Id._ ¶ 46; Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 740.

[.text-justify]
Like ODL, some, but not all, of Ripple’s products and services rely on the XRP Ledger and XRP. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 44. The XRP Ledger is based on open-source software; anyone can use the ledger, submit transactions, host a node to contribute to the validation of transactions, propose changes to the source code, or develop applications that run on the ledger. _Id._ ¶¶ 52, 54. Other developers have built software products that use the XRP Ledger, such as payment-processing applications. _Id._ ¶ 59. Ripple has also funded companies as part of its “Xpring” initiative to incentivize the development of other use “cases” on the XRP Ledger. _Id._ ¶¶ 58–59.

&emsp;&emsp;B&period; Defendants’ Sales and Distributions of XRP

[.text-justify]
At all times before the end of 2020, Ripple owned between 50 and 80 billion XRP. _See_ Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 15, 35; _see also id._ ¶ 256. Although the parties dispute the specific dollar amounts and details, they agree that from 2013 through the end of 2020, Ripple engaged in various sales and distributions of XRP. _See id._ ¶¶ 647, 716; _see generally_ SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 92–123.

[.text-justify]
First, Ripple, through wholly owned subsidiaries, sold XRP directly to certain counterparties (primarily institutional buyers, hedge funds, and ODL customers) pursuant to written contracts (the “Institutional Sales”). SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 105; Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 5–6, 619–20, 716. The SEC alleges that Ripple sold approximately $728.9 million of XRP in these Institutional Sales. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 716.

[.text-justify]
Second, Ripple sold XRP on digital asset exchanges “programmatically,” or through the use of trading algorithms (the “Programmatic Sales”). SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 95; Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 647. Ripple’s XRP sales on these digital asset exchanges were blind bid/ask transactions: Ripple did not know who was buying the XRP, and the purchasers did not know who was selling it. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 96; Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 652–54. The SEC alleges that Ripple sold approximately $757.6 million of XRP in Programmatic Sales. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 647. Ripple used the proceeds from the Institutional and Programmatic Sales to fund its operations. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 156–70.^*(xref:sec_ripple_footnote_5[5])*^

[.text-justify]
Ripple also distributed XRP as a form of payment for services (“Other Distributions”). Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 827–30. For instance, Ripple distributed XRP to its employees as a form of employee compensation. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 110; Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 217–18. Ripple also distributed XRP in conjunction with its Xpring initiative to fund third parties that would develop new applications for XRP and the XRP Ledger. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 831–32. In sum, the SEC alleges that Ripple recognized revenue of $609 million from its distributions of XRP to
individuals and entities in exchange for services. _Id._ ¶¶ 829–30. ^*(xref:sec_ripple_footnote_6[6])*^

[.text-justify]
In addition to Ripple’s sales and distributions, Larsen and Garlinghouse offered and sold XRP in their individual capacities. After stepping down as CEO of Ripple in December 2016, Larsen became the Executive Chairman of Ripple’s Board of Directors, a position he currently holds. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 128–29. From at least 2013 through 2020, Larsen sold XRP on digital asset exchanges programmatically and made at least $450 million from his sales. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 868.

[.text-justify]
Garlinghouse was hired as Ripple’s COO in April 2015. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 140. After Larsen stepped down as CEO, Garlinghouse became CEO effective January 1, 2017, a position he currently holds. _Id._ ¶ 143. From April 2017 through 2020, Garlinghouse sold XRP on digital asset exchanges, id. ¶¶ 303, 310; the SEC alleges that Garlinghouse sold approximately $150 million in XRP during this period, Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 870. Garlinghouse has also received XRP as part of his overall compensation from Ripple. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 145. Defendants did not file a registration statement as to any offers or sales of XRP. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 928. Ripple did not publicly file any financial statements or other periodic reports, nor did it make any EDGAR filings^* (xref:sec_ripple_footnote_7[7])*^ with the SEC for Ripple or XRP, such as a Form 10-Q, Form 10-K, or Form 8-K relating to XRP. _Id._ ¶¶ 930–32.

&emsp;&emsp;C&period; Defendants’ XRP Marketing Campaign

[.text-justify]
The SEC alleges that “in 2013 Defendants began extensive, years-long marketing efforts representing they would search for purported ‘use’ and ‘value’ for XRP—and casting XRP as an opportunity to invest in those efforts.” SEC Opp. at 4, ECF No. 841. The SEC points to a wide range of statements, including informational brochures, internal talking points, public blog posts, statements on social media, videos, interviews with various Ripple employees, and more. Defendants dispute the SEC’s factual narrative and argue that the SEC “cherry-picks excerpts from documents with many authors and from public statements of many speakers, made at many points across an eight-year period of time to many audiences.” Defs. Opp. at 10, ECF No. 828.^*(xref:sec_ripple_footnote_8[8])*^

[.text-justify]
Since at least 2013, Ripple has prepared and distributed documents that describe the company’s operations, the XRP trading market, and the XRP Ledger. For example, in 2013 and 2014, Ripple created three brochures: a “Ripple for Gateways” brochure, a “Ripple Primer,” and a “Deep Dive for Finance Professionals.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 59–60, 171. These documents were distributed publicly to prospective and existing XRP investors and outline, among other things, the relationship between XRP and Ripple’s business model. _Id._ Ripple circulated versions of the “Gateways” brochure to more than one hundred third parties, id. ¶ 172; the “Primer” had “widespread distribution,” id. ¶ 178; and the “Deep Dive” was posted on Ripple’s website and sent to over one hundred people, id. ¶¶ 185–86. Later, starting at the end of 2016, Ripple began to publish on its website quarterly “XRP Market Reports,” which were intended to provide “clarity and visibility” about Ripple’s market activities. _Id._ ¶¶ 500–01.

[.text-justify]
Ripple and its senior leaders used a variety of social media platforms—including Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and XRP Chat, an online forum described as “The Largest XRP Crypto Community Forum”—to communicate about XRP and Ripple. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 77, 192; _see, e.g., id._ ¶¶ 391–96, 401–08, 425, 437–40. Ripple officials also spoke in interviews about the company and its relationship to XRP. For instance, Larsen gave interviews in which he discussed XRP, e.g., id. ¶¶ 371, 377, and Garlinghouse was interviewed by media outlets such as the Financial Times, Bloomberg, and CNBC, spoke with organizations like the Economic Club of New York, and participated at conferences such as DC Fintech, in which he described Ripple’s operations and the XRP market, _e.g., id._ ¶¶ 252, 263, 269, 387, 444, 446. 

&emsp;&emsp;D&period; Defendants’ Receipt of Legal Advice About XRP Offers and Sales

[.text-justify]
In February 2012, before the XRP Ledger was publicly launched, Ripple’s founders, including Larsen, received from the Perkins Coie LLP law firm a memorandum, which sought to “review the proposed product and business structure, analyze the legal risks associated with [Ripple], and recommend steps to mitigate these risks.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 986; _see_ ECF No. 846-29 at 4. The memorandum analyzes, among other things, the legal risks associated with selling XRP. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 986. Specifically, it states that “[i]f sold to [i]nvestors, [XRP tokens] are likely to be securities,” and “[t]o the extent that [the founders’] issuance of [XRP] does not involve an investment of money, there is a low risk that [XRP] will be considered an investment contract.” _Id._ ¶¶ 986, 989; _see_ ECF No. 846-29 at 5, 12.

[.text-justify]
In October 2012, Ripple, Larsen, and others received another memorandum from Perkins Coie which sought to “review the proposed features of the Ripple [n]etwork and [XRP] and to provide recommendations for mitigating relevant legal risks.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 987; _see_ ECF No. 846-30 at 3. That memorandum states that “[a]lthough we believe that a compelling argument can be made that [XRP tokens] do not constitute ‘securities’ under federal securities laws, given the lack of applicable case law, we believe that there is some risk, albeit small, that the [SEC] disagrees with our analysis.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 993; _see_ ECF No. 846-30 at 6. The memorandum further states that, “[t]he more that [the founders and Ripple] promote [XRP] as an investment opportunity, the more likely it is that the SEC will take action and argue that [XRP tokens] are ‘investment contracts.’” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 993; _see_ ECF No. 846-30 at 6.

[.text-justify]
Larsen reviewed both the February and the October 2012 memoranda and discussed them with Perkins Coie attorneys. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 998. Both memoranda analyze XRP under the Supreme Court’s holding in _SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.,_ 328 U.S. 293 (1946), which outlines the standard for an investment contract. _Id._ ¶ 988.


&emsp;II&period;&emsp; Procedural Background

On December 22, 2020, the SEC commenced this action. ECF No. 1. An amended complaint was filed on February 18, 2021. Am. Compl. Fact discovery closed on August 31, 2021, _see_ ECF No. 313, and expert discovery concluded on February 28, 2022, _see_ ECF No. 411. On March 11, 2022, the Court denied the SEC’s motion to strike Ripple’s affirmative defense that it “lacked . . . ‘notice that its conduct was in violation of law, in contravention of Ripple’s due process rights,’” ECF No. 128. ECF No. 440. That same day, the Court also denied Garlinghouse’s and Larsen’s separate motions to dismiss, ECF Nos. 105, 110. MTD Order, ECF No. 441.

*DISCUSSION*

&emsp;I&period;&emsp; [underline]#Legal Standard#

&emsp;&emsp;A&period; Summary Judgment

[.text-justify]
Summary judgment is appropriate where the record shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); _see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,_ 477 U.S. 242, 247–48 (1986); _Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,_ 477 U.S. 317, 322–26 (1986). A genuine dispute exists “if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” _Anderson,_ 477 U.S. at 248.

[.text-justify]
The moving party initially bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact by citing evidence in the record. _See_ Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323–24; Koch v. Town of Brattleboro, Vt., 287 F.3d 162, 165 (2d Cir. 2002). If the moving party meets its initial burden, the burden then shifts to the opposing party to establish a genuine dispute of material fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1); Beard v. Banks, 548 U.S. 521, 529 (2006); PepsiCo, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., 315 F.3d 101, 105 (2d Cir. 2002) (per curiam). In doing so, the nonmoving party “may not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation,” Scotto v. Almenas, 143 F.3d 105, 114 (2d Cir. 1998), as “unsupported allegations do not create a material issue of fact,” Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., 224 F.3d 33, 41 (2d Cir. 2000).

&emsp;&emsp;B&period; Section 5 Liability and the _Howey_ Test

[.text-justify]
Under Section 5 of the Securities Act, it is “unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, . . . to offer to sell, offer to buy or purchase[,] or sell” a “security” unless a registration statement is in effect or has been filed with the SEC as to the offer and sale of such security to the public. 15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), (c), (e). To prove a violation of Section 5, the SEC must show: (1) that no registration statement was filed or in effect as to the transaction, and (2) that the defendant directly or indirectly offered to sell or sold the securities (3) through interstate commerce. _See SEC v. Cavanagh,_ 445 F.3d 105, 111 n.13 (2d Cir. 2006).

[.text-justify]
Defendants do not dispute that they offered to sell and sold XRP through interstate commerce. _See, e.g.,_ Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 647, 716, 868, 870. They also do not dispute that they did not file a registration statement with the SEC for any offer or sale of XRP. _Id._ ¶ 928. The question before the Court is whether Defendants offered to sell or sold XRP as a security. Specifically, the SEC alleges that Defendants sold XRP as an “investment contract,” which is a type of security as defined by the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(1). _See, e.g.,_ SEC Mem. at 2, 5, 49, ECF No. 837; Am. Compl. ¶¶ 3, 9, 60. Defendants argue that they did not sell XRP as an investment contract, and, therefore, no registration statement was required. _See, e.g.,_ Defs. Mem. at 3, 36, ECF No. 825; Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 928.

[.text-justify]
In _SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.,_ the Supreme Court held that under the Securities Act, an investment contract is “a contract, transaction[,] or scheme whereby a person [(1)] invests his money [(2)] in a common enterprise and [(3)] is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.” 328 U.S. at 298–99; _see also SEC v. Edwards,_ 540 U.S. 389, 393 (2004). In analyzing whether a contract, transaction, or scheme is an investment contract, “form should be disregarded for substance and the emphasis should be on economic reality” and the “totality of circumstances.” _Tcherepnin v. Knight,_ 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967); _Glen-Arden Commodities, Inc. v. Constantino,_ 493 F.2d 1027, 1034 (2d Cir. 1974).

&emsp;&emsp;C&period; Defendants’ “Essential Ingredients” Test

[.text-justify]
In their summary judgment briefing, Defendants advance a novel “essential ingredients” test, arguing that, in addition to the _Howey_ test, all investment contracts must contain three “essential ingredients”: (1) “a contract between a promoter and an investor that establishe[s] the investor’s rights as to an investment,” which contract (2) “impose[s] post-sale obligations on the promoter to take specific actions for the investor’s benefit” and (3) “grant[s] the investor a right to share in profits from the promoter’s efforts to generate a return on the use of investor funds.” Defs. Mem. at 2; _see id._ at 13–28.

[.text-justify]
The Court declines to adopt Defendants’ “essential ingredients” test, which would call for the Court to read beyond the plain words of _Howey_ and impose additional requirements not mandated by the Supreme Court. The Court sees no reason to do so. Neither _Howey_, nor its progeny, hold that an investment contract requires the existence of Defendants’ “essential ingredients.” To the contrary, these cases make clear that the relevant test reflects a focus on an investor’s expectation of “profits . . . from the efforts of others,” rather than the formal imposition of post-sale obligations on the promoter or the grant to an investor of a right to share in profits. _Howey_, 328 U.S. at 301. The Supreme Court’s use of the word “profits” in _Howey_ was intended to refer to “income or return,” _Edwards,_ 540 U.S. at 394, and financial returns on investments are not equivalent to post-sale obligations or profit sharing. Thus, the Court is not persuaded that precedent supports the consideration of these “ingredients” in determining whether a contract, transaction, or scheme constitutes an investment contract under _Howey_.

[.text-justify]
Defendants do not cite a single case that has applied their test. _See generally_ Defs. Mem. at 13–28. Rather, Defendants contend that the Court should look to the pre-1933 state “blue sky” law cases on which the _Howey_ Court relied. _Id._ at 16–17. According to Defendants, every pre-1933 blue sky investment contract case involved a contract, post-sale obligations on the promoter, and the investor’s right to receive a profit. _Id._ at 18–21. That may be so, but the _Howey_ Court relied on the state courts’ definition of an investment contract as “a contract or scheme for the placing of capital or laying out of money in a way intended to secure income or profit from its employment” when fashioning the relevant test. 328 U.S. at 298 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Had the Supreme Court intended to incorporate these ingredients as essential requirements, it would have done so. In any event, even accepting Defendants’ survey and analysis of the caselaw as accurate, the fact that pre-1933 investment contract cases shared some common features does not convert those common features into requirements necessary for finding an investment contract under _Howey_. Rather, the Supreme Court was guided by the “fundamental purpose undergirding the Securities Acts,” in which Congress “painted with a broad brush” in recognition of the “virtually limitless scope of human ingenuity.” _Reves v. Ernst & Young,_ 494 U.S. 56, 60–61 (1990). So, too, must this Court be guided.

[.text-justify]
Indeed, in the more than seventy-five years of securities law jurisprudence after _Howey_, courts have found the existence of an investment contract even in the absence of Defendants’ “essential ingredients,” including in recent digital asset cases in this District. _See, e.g., SEC v. Kik Interactive Inc.,_ 492 F. Supp. 3d 169, 175–80 (S.D.N.Y. 2020); _Balestra v. ATBCOIN LLC,_ 380 F. Supp. 3d 340, 354 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (“ATB Coins did not entitle purchasers to a pro rata share of the profits derived from any ATB-managed transaction . . . . However, such a formalized profit-sharing mechanism is not required.”). And this makes sense, given that the _Howey_ test was intended to “embod[y] a flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.” 328 U.S. at 299. Put differently, the _Howey_ test was intended to effectuate “[t]he statutory policy of affording broad protection to investors,” protection that is “not to be thwarted by unrealistic and irrelevant formulae.” _Id._ at 301. Accordingly, the Court rejects Defendants’ argument that all investment contracts must include post-sale obligations on the promoter and grant the investor a right to share in profits from the promoter’s efforts.

[.text-justify]
The Court does not reach Defendants’ first “essential ingredient”: that a contract must exist for an investment contract to exist.^*(xref:sec_ripple_footnote_11[11])*^ As discussed in greater detail below, in each instance where Defendants offered or sold XRP as an investment contract, a contract existed.

&emsp;II&period;&emsp; [underline]#Analysis#

&emsp;&emsp;A&period; The XRP Token

[.text-justify]
The plain words of _Howey_ make clear that “an investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means _a contract, transaction[,] or scheme._” 328 U.S. at 298–99 (emphasis
added). But the subject of a contract, transaction, or scheme is not necessarily a security on its face. Under _Howey_, the Court analyzes the economic reality and totality of circumstances surrounding the offers and sales of the underlying asset. _See Tcherepnin,_ 389 U.S. at 336; _Glen-Arden,_ 493 F.2d at 1034.

[.text-justify]
_Howey_ and its progeny have held that a variety of tangible and intangible assets can serve as the subject of an investment contract. _See, e.g., Howey_, 328 U.S. 293 (orange groves); _Glen-Arden,_ 493 F.2d 1027 (whiskey casks); _Edwards,_ 540 U.S. 389 (payphones); _Hocking v. Dubois,_ 885 F.2d 1449 (9th Cir. 1989) (condominiums), _cert. denied_, 494 U.S. 1078 (1990); _Cont’l Mktg. Corp. v. SEC,_ 387 F.2d 466 (10th Cir. 1967) (beavers); _SEC v. Telegram Grp. Inc.,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d 352 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (digital tokens). In each of these cases, the subject of the investment contract was a standalone commodity, which was not itself inherently an investment contract. For instance, if the original citrus groves in _Howey_ were later resold, those resales may or may not constitute investment contracts, depending on the totality of circumstances surrounding the later transaction.

[.text-justify]
Here, Defendants argue that XRP does not have the “character in commerce” of a security and is akin to other “ordinary assets” like gold, silver, and sugar. _See_ Defs. Mem. at
3–4, 42–44 (citation omitted). This argument misses the point because ordinary assets—like gold, silver, and sugar—may be sold as investment contracts, depending on the circumstances of those sales. _See Glen-Arden,_ 493 F.2d at 1033, 1035; _Fedance v. Harris,_ 1 F.4th 1278, 1288–89 (11th Cir. 2021) (“Plenty of items that can be consumed or used . . . have been the subject of transactions determined to be securities because they had the attributes of an investment.” (citation omitted)). Even if XRP exhibits certain characteristics of a commodity or a currency, it may nonetheless be offered or sold as an investment contract. +
&nbsp; +
[.quoteblock .text-justify]#As another court in this District recently held: +
&nbsp; +
While helpful as a shorthand reference, the security in this case is not simply the [digital token, the] Gram, which is little more than alphanumeric cryptographic sequence . . . . This case presents a “scheme” to be evaluated under _Howey_ that consists of the full set of contracts, expectations, and understandings centered on the sales and distribution of the Gram. _Howey_ requires an examination of the entirety of the parties’ understandings and expectations.# +
_Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 379. XRP, as a digital token, is not in and of itself a “contract, transaction[,] or scheme” that embodies the _Howey_ requirements of an investment contract. Rather, the Court examines the totality of circumstances surrounding Defendants’ different transactions and schemes involving the sale and distribution of XRP. _See Marine Bank v. Weaver,_ 455 U.S. 551, 560 n.11 (1982) (“Each transaction must be analyzed and evaluated on the basis of the content of the instruments in question, the purposes intended to be served, and the factual setting as a whole.”).


&emsp;&emsp;B&period; Defendants’ Offers and Sales of XRP

[.text-justify]
The parties cross-move for summary judgment on the SEC’s claim under Section 5 of the Securities Act. Whether Defendants offered or sold “investment contracts” is a legal question that the Court resolves based on the undisputed record. _See SEC v. Thompson,_ 732 F.3d 1151, 1160–61 (10th Cir. 2013) (collecting cases). The SEC alleges that Ripple engaged in three categories of unregistered XRP offers and sales: + 
[.quoteblock .text-justify]#&nbsp; +
(1) Institutional Sales under written contracts for which it received $728 million; +
(2) Programmatic Sales on digital asset exchanges for which it received $757 million; and +
(3) Other Distributions under written contracts for which it recorded $609 million
in “consideration other than cash.”# +
_See_ SEC Reply at 4–5, ECF No. 843. The SEC also alleges that Larsen and Garlinghouse engaged in unregistered individual XRP sales, from which they received at least $450 million and $150 million, respectively. _See id._ at 5. The Court shall separately analyze and evaluate each category of transaction. _See Marine Bank,_ 455 U.S. at 560 n.11.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1&period; Institutional Sales

[.text-justify]
The Court first addresses Ripple’s Institutional Sales of XRP to sophisticated individuals and entities (the “Institutional Buyers”) pursuant to written contracts. _See_ SEC Mem. at 28–31; Defs. Mem. at 11. The SEC alleges that these Institutional Sales were distributions of XRP into public markets through conduits, and that “some Institutional [Buyers] were buying XRP as brokers, while others simply resold it as part of their trading strategies.” SEC Mem. at 28–29.

[.text-justify]
The first prong of _Howey_ examines whether an “investment of money” was part of the relevant transaction. 328 U.S. at 301. Here, the Institutional Buyers invested money by providing fiat or other currency in exchange for XRP. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 607. Defendants do not dispute that Ripple received money for XRP through its Institutional Sales. _See_ Defs. Mem. at 11; Defs. Opp. at 17 n.7. However, Defendants argue that an “investment of money” is different from “merely payment of money”—that is, _Howey_ requires not just payment of money but an intent to invest that money. _See_ Defs. Opp. at 18–19.

[.text-justify]
Not so. Defendants’ purported distinction is not supported by caselaw. The proper inquiry is whether the Institutional Buyers “provide[d] the capital,” _Howey_, 328 U.S. at 300, “put up their money,” _Glen-Arden,_ 493 F.2d at 1034, or “provide[d]” cash, _Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 368–69. Defendants do not dispute that there was a payment of money; the Court finds, therefore, that this element has been established.

[.text-justify]
The second prong of _Howey_, the existence of a “common enterprise,” 328 U.S. at 301, may be demonstrated through a showing of “horizontal commonality,” _Revak v. SEC Realty Corp.,_ 18 F.3d 81, 87 (2d Cir. 1994). Horizontal commonality exists where the investors’ assets are pooled and the fortunes of each investor are tied to the fortunes of other investors, as well as to the success of the overall enterprise. _See id._ at 88; _see also SEC v. SG Ltd.,_ 265 F.3d 42, 49 (1st Cir. 2001) (“[H]orizontal commonality [is] a type of commonality that involves the pooling of assets from multiple investors so that all share in the profits and risks of the enterprise.”); _ATBCOIN LLC,_ 380 F. Supp. 3d at 353.^*(xref:sec_ripple_footnote_12[12])*^

[.text-justify]
Here, the undisputed record shows the existence of horizontal commonality. Ripple pooled the proceeds of its Institutional Sales into a network of bank accounts under the names of its various subsidiaries. _See, e.g.,_ ECF No. 831-29 ¶¶ 3–4; Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 795–98; _see also id._ ¶ 1004. Although Ripple maintained separate bank accounts for each subsidiary, Ripple controlled all of the accounts and used the funds raised from the Institutional Sales to finance its operations. _See_ Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 255–56; SEC Reply at 8; _cf._ Defs. Opp. at 22–23; Defs. Reply at 19–20, ECF No. 832. Defendants do not dispute that Ripple did not “segregate[] and separately manage[]” investor funds or “allow[] for profits to remain independent.” _Kik_, 492 F. Supp. 3d at 179; _see_ SEC Reply at 8. And, Ripple’s accountants recorded all of its XRP-related proceeds together. _See_ Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 147–48. 

[.text-justify]
Further, each Institutional Buyer’s ability to profit was tied to Ripple’s fortunes and the fortunes of other Institutional Buyers because all Institutional Buyers received the same fungible XRP.^*(xref:sec_ripple_footnote_13[13])*^ _See id._ ¶¶ 206–07. Ripple used the funds it received from its Institutional Sales to promote and increase the value of XRP by developing uses for XRP and protecting the XRP trading market. _See id._ ¶¶ 156–57, 161–68, 255–56. When the value of XRP rose, all Institutional Buyers profited in proportion to their XRP holdings. _See Kik,_ 492 F. Supp. 3d at 178 (“The success of the ecosystem drove demand for [the digital token] Kin and thus dictated investors’ profits.”); _Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 369–70 (finding horizontal commonality where the digital token purchasers “possess an identical instrument, the value of which is entirely dependent on the success or failure of the TON Blockchain” and “[t]he investors’ fortunes are directly tied to the success of the TON Blockchain as a whole”). The Court finds the existence of a common enterprise because the record demonstrates that there was a pooling of assets and that the fortunes of the Institutional Buyers were tied to the success of the enterprise as well as to the success of other Institutional Buyers.

[.text-justify]
The third prong of _Howey_ examines whether the economic reality surrounding Ripple’s Institutional Sales led the Institutional Buyers to have “a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.” _See United Hous. Found., Inc. v. Forman,_ 421 U.S. 837, 852 (1975).^*(xref:sec_ripple_footnote_14[14])*^ In this context, profit means an “income or return, to include, for example, dividends, other periodic payments, or _the increased value of the investment._” _Edwards_, 540 U.S. at 394 (emphasis added). The reasonable expectation of profits from the efforts of others need not be the sole reason a purchaser buys an investment; an asset may be sold for both consumptive and speculative uses. _See SEC v. LBRY, Inc.,_ No. 21 Civ. 260, 2022 WL 16744741, at *7 (D.N.H. Nov. 7, 2022). Moreover, “[t]he inquiry is an objective one focusing on the promises and offers made to investors; it is not a search for the precise motivation of each individual participant.” _Telegram_, 448 F. Supp. 3d at 371 (citing _Warfield v. Alaniz,_ 569 F.3d 1015, 1021 (9th Cir. 2009)).

[.text-justify]
Based on the totality of circumstances, the Court finds that reasonable investors, situated in the position of the Institutional Buyers, would have purchased XRP with the expectation that they would derive profits from Ripple’s efforts. From Ripple’s communications, marketing campaign, and the nature of the Institutional Sales, reasonable investors would understand that Ripple would use the capital received from its Institutional Sales to improve the market for XRP and develop uses for the XRP Ledger, thereby increasing the value of XRP. _Cf. Kik,_ 492 F. Supp. 3d at 179–80; _Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 371–78.

[.text-justify]
Starting in 2013, Ripple marketed XRP to potential investors, including the Institutional Buyers, by distributing promotional brochures that touted XRP as an investment tied to the company’s success. For instance, in the “Deep Dive” brochure, which was circulated to prospective investors, Ripple explains that its “business model is predicated on a belief that demand for XRP will increase . . . if the Ripple protocol becomes widely adopted,” and “[i]f the Ripple protocol becomes the backbone of global value transfer, Ripple . . . expects the demand for XRP to be considerable.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 187; ECF No. 855-14 at 23, 29, 31. Similarly, the “Ripple Primer” states that Ripple “hopes to make money from XRP if the world finds the Ripple network useful.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 180; ECF No. 861-26 at 20. The “Gateways” brochure also explains that “Ripple’s business model is based on the success of [XRP,]” and includes a graphical representation of bitcoin’s price change below the text: “Can a virtual currency really create and hold value? _Bitcoin proves it can_.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 173, 175; ECF No. 861-25 at 21.

[.text-justify]
Later, through its XRP Market Reports, Ripple continued to connect XRP’s price and trading to its own efforts. Ripple’s Q1 2017 XRP Markets Report states that the company’s efforts—including its “vocal . . . commitment to XRP,” the announcement of a new business relationship, and “continu[ing] to sign up banks to commercially deploy its enterprise blockchain solution and join its global payments network”—may have had an impact on XRP’s price increase and “impressive” trading volume. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 421; ECF No. 839-4 at 9. The Q2 2017 XRP Markets Report highlights XRP’s “dramatic” and “stunning” price increase and notes that “[t]he market responded favorably to [Ripple’s] escrow and decentralization announcements.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 422; ECF No. 839-4 at 16. Similarly, Ripple’s Q1 2020 XRP Markets Report states that XRP’s liquidity was “bolstered through new use cases for XRP outside of cross-border payments.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 366; ECF No. 839-4 at 98.

[.text-justify]
During this time, Ripple’s senior leaders echoed similar statements on various public channels. In a February 2014 interview, Larsen said, “for Ripple . . . to do well, we have to do a very good job in protecting the value of XRP and the value of the network,” and asked potential investors to “[g]ive [Ripple] time” to “add[] the most value to the protocol.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 461. In July 2017, David Schwartz, who was then chief cryptographer at Ripple, _see id._ ¶ 40, wrote on Reddit that “Ripple’s interest[s] closely (but, yes, not perfectly) align with those of other XRP holders,” id. ¶ 462. In February 2018, Schwartz posted on Reddit that what “really set[s] XRP apart from any other digital asset” is the “amazing team of dedicated professionals that Ripple has managed to amass to develop an ecosystem around XRP.” _Id._ ¶¶ 345, 349, 360. In a December 2017 interview, Garlinghouse stated that XRP gave Ripple “a huge strategic asset to go invest in and accelerate the vision [it] see[s] for an internet of value.” _Id._ ¶ 468. And, in March 2018, Garlinghouse said at a press conference that “Ripple is very, very interested in the success and the health of the ecosystem and will continue to invest in the ecosystem.” _Id._ ¶ 469.

[.text-justify]
Ripple and its senior leaders publicly emphasized the complexity of creating an “internet of value” and the need for extensive capital to solve this “trillion dollar” problem. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 101. For instance, in October 2017, Garlinghouse declared in a YouTube video: “I have no qualms saying definitively if we continue to drive the success we’re driving, we’re going to drive a massive amount of demand for XRP because we’re solving a multitrillion dollar problem.” _Id._ ¶ 98; _see also id._ ¶¶ 99–101. In July 2017, Schwartz wrote on Reddit that, “Ripple can justify spending $100 million on a project if it could reasonably be expected to increase the price of XRP by one penny over the long term.” _Id._ ¶ 462. In November 2017, Schwartz posted on XRP Chat that Ripple would use its “war chest” to put upward pressure on XRP’s price. _Id._ ¶ 445.

[.text-justify]
These statements, and many more, are representative of Ripple’s overall messaging to the Institutional Buyers about the investment potential of XRP and its relationship to Defendants’ efforts. Clearly, the Institutional Buyers would have understood that Ripple was pitching a speculative value proposition for XRP with potential profits to be derived from Ripple’s entrepreneurial and managerial efforts. _See LBRY,_ 2022 WL 16744741, at *5–6.

[.text-justify]
Further, the nature of the Institutional Sales also supports the conclusion that Ripple sold XRP as an investment rather than for consumptive use. In their sales contracts, some Institutional Buyers agreed to lockup provisions or resale restrictions based on XRP’s trading volume. _See, e.g.,_ Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 575, 800–01. These restrictions are inconsistent with the notion that XRP was used as a currency or for some other consumptive use. “Simply put, a rational economic actor would not agree to freeze millions of dollars . . . if the purchaser’s intent was to obtain a substitute for fiat currency.” _Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 373. Certain Institutional Sales contracts required the Institutional Buyer to indemnify Ripple for claims arising out of the sale or distribution of XRP, _see_ Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 792, and other contracts expressly stated that the Institutional Buyer was purchasing XRP “solely to resell or otherwise distribute . . . and not to use [XRP] as an [e]nd [u]ser or for any other purpose.” _Id._ ¶ 793. These various provisions in the Institutional Sales contracts support the conclusion that the parties did not view the XRP sale as a sale of a commodity or a currency—they understood the sale of XRP to be an investment in Ripple’s efforts.

[.text-justify]
Therefore, having considered the economic reality and totality of circumstances surrounding the Institutional Sales, the Court concludes that Ripple’s Institutional Sales of XRP constituted the unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act.^*(xref:sec_ripple_footnote_15[15])*^

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2&period; Programmatic Sales

[.text-justify]
The Court next addresses Ripple’s Programmatic Sales, which occurred under different circumstances from the Institutional Sales. _See_ SEC Mem. at 28; Defs. Mem. at 10–11. The SEC alleges that in the Programmatic Sales to public buyers (“Programmatic Buyers”) on digital asset exchanges, “Ripple understood that people were speculating on XRP as an investment,” “explicitly targeted speculators[,] and made increased speculative volume a ‘target goal.’” SEC Mem. at 28.

[.text-justify]
Having considered the economic reality of the Programmatic Sales, the Court concludes that the undisputed record does not establish the third _Howey_ prong. Whereas the Institutional Buyers reasonably expected that Ripple would use the capital it received from its sales to improve the XRP ecosystem and thereby increase the price of XRP, _see Kik,_ 492 F. Supp. 3d at 180; _cf. supra_ § II.B.1, Programmatic Buyers could not reasonably expect the same. Indeed, Ripple’s Programmatic Sales were blind bid/ask transactions, and Programmatic Buyers could not have known if their payments of money went to Ripple, or any other seller of XRP. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 96; Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 652–54. Since 2017, Ripple’s Programmatic Sales represented less than 1% of the global XRP trading volume. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 77, 82. Therefore, the vast majority of individuals who purchased XRP from digital asset exchanges did not invest their money in Ripple at all. An Institutional Buyer knowingly purchased XRP directly from Ripple pursuant to a contract, but the economic reality is that a Programmatic Buyer stood in the same shoes as a secondary market purchaser who did not know to whom or what it was paying its money.^*(xref:sec_ripple_footnote_16[16])*^

[.text-justify]
Further, it is not enough for the SEC to argue that Ripple “explicitly targeted speculators” or that “Ripple understood that people were speculating on XRP as an investment,” SEC Mem. at 28, because a speculative motive “on the part of the purchaser or seller does not evidence the existence of an ‘investment contract’ within the meaning of the [Securities Act],” _Sinva, Inc. v. Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.,_ 253 F. Supp. 359, 367 (S.D.N.Y. 1966). “[A]nyone who buys or sells[, for example,] a horse or an automobile hopes to realize a profitable ‘investment.’ But the expected return is not contingent upon the continuing efforts of another.” _Id._ (citing _SEC v. C.M. Joiner Leasing Corp.,_ 320 U.S. 344, 348 (1943)). The relevant inquiry is whether this speculative motive “derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.” _Forman_, 421 U.S. at 852. It may certainly be the case that many Programmatic Buyers purchased XRP with an expectation of profit, but they did not derive that expectation from Ripple’s efforts (as opposed to other factors, such as general cryptocurrency market trends)—particularly because none of the Programmatic Buyers were aware that they were buying XRP from Ripple.

[.text-justify]
Of course, some Programmatic Buyers may have purchased XRP with the expectation of profits to be derived from Ripple’s efforts. However, “[t]he inquiry is an objective one focusing on the promises and offers made to investors; it is not a search for the precise motivation of each individual participant.” _Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 371 (citation omitted). Here, the record establishes that with respect to Programmatic Sales, Ripple did not make any promises or offers because Ripple did not know who was buying the XRP, and the purchasers did not know who was selling it. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 96; Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 652–54. In fact, many Programmatic Buyers were entirely unaware of Ripple’s existence. SEC Add. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 1606, ECF No. 844; ECF Nos. 831-1–831-26.

[.text-justify]
The Programmatic Sales also lacked other factors present in the economic reality of the Institutional Sales which cut in favor of finding “a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.” _Forman_, 421 U.S. at 852; _cf. supra_ § II.B.1. For instance, the Programmatic Sales were not made pursuant to contracts that contained lockup provisions, resale restrictions, indemnification clauses, or statements of purpose. _Cf. Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 373. Similarly, Ripple’s promotional materials, such as the “Ripple Primer” and the “Gateways” brochure, were widely circulated amongst potential investors like the Institutional Buyers. But, there is no evidence that these documents were distributed more broadly to the general public, such as XRP purchasers on digital asset exchanges. Nor is there evidence that Programmatic Buyers understood that statements made by Larsen, Schwartz, Garlinghouse, and others were representations of Ripple and its efforts.

[.text-justify]
Lastly, the Institutional Buyers were sophisticated entities, including institutional investors and hedge funds. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 105. An “examination of the entirety of the parties’ understandings and expectations,” including the “full set of contracts, expectations, and understandings centered on the sales and distribution of” XRP supports the conclusion that a reasonable investor, situated in the position of the Institutional Buyers, would have been aware of Ripple’s marketing campaign and public statements connecting XRP’s price to its own efforts. _Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 379. There is no evidence that a reasonable Programmatic Buyer, who was generally less sophisticated as an investor, shared similar “understandings and expectations” and could parse through the multiple documents and statements that the SEC highlights, which include statements (sometimes inconsistent) across many social media platforms and news sites from a variety of Ripple speakers (with different levels of authority) over an extended eight-year period.

[.text-justify]
Therefore, having considered the economic reality and totality of circumstances, the Court concludes that Ripple’s Programmatic Sales of XRP did not constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts.^*(xref:sec_ripple_footnote_17[17])*^

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;3&period; Other Distributions

[.text-justify]
The SEC’s last category of XRP offers and sales are “Other Distributions under written  contracts for which [Ripple] recorded $609 million in ‘consideration other than cash’ in its audited financial statements.” SEC Reply at 5. These Other Distributions include distributions to employees as compensation and to third parties as part of Ripple’s Xpring initiative to develop new applications for XRP and the XRP Ledger. SEC Mem. at 31–32. The SEC alleges that “Ripple funded its projects by transferring XRP to third parties and then having them sell the XRP into public markets.” _Id._ at 31.

[.text-justify]
The Other Distributions do not satisfy _Howey’s_ first prong that there be an “investment of money” as part of the transaction or scheme. 328 U.S. at 301. _Howey_ requires a showing that the investors “provide[d] the capital,” id. at 300, “put up their money,” _Glen-Arden,_ 493 F.2d at 1034, or “provide[d]” cash, _Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 368–69. “In every case [finding an investment contract] the purchaser gave up some tangible and definable consideration in return for an interest that had substantially the characteristics of a security.” _Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v. Daniel,_ 439 U.S. 551, 560 (1979). Here, the record shows that recipients of the Other Distributions did not pay money or “some tangible and definable consideration” to Ripple. To the contrary, Ripple paid XRP to these employees and companies. And, as a factual matter, there is no evidence that “Ripple funded its projects by transferring XRP to third parties and then having them sell the XRP,” SEC Mem. at 31, because Ripple never received the payments from these XRP distributions.

[.text-justify]
In its opposition papers, the SEC pivots and argues instead that the Other Distributions were an indirect public offering because “the parties that received XRP from Ripple, such as an ‘[Xpring] recipient,’ could ‘transfer their XRP (in exchange for units of another currency, goods, or services) to another holder.’” SEC Opp. at 26 (citation omitted). But the SEC does not elsewhere allege that the recipients of these Other Distributions, like Ripple employees and Xpring third-party companies, were Ripple’s underwriters. In any event, the SEC does not develop the argument that these secondary market sales were offers or sales of investment contracts, particularly where the payment of money for these XRP sales never traced back to Ripple, and the Court cannot make such a finding. Therefore, having considered the economic reality and totality of circumstances, the Court concludes that Ripple’s Other Distributions did not constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts.^*(xref:sec_ripple_footnote_18[18])*^

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;4&period; Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s Offers and Sales

[.text-justify]
Lastly, the Court addresses Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s offers and sales of XRP. Section 4(a)(1) of the Securities Act exempts “transactions by any person other than an issuer, underwriter, or dealer.” 15 U.S.C. § 77d(a)(1). The SEC argues that this exemption does not apply to Larsen and Garlinghouse because they are “affiliates” of Ripple and “an affiliate of the issuer—such as an officer, director, or controlling shareholder—ordinarily may not rely upon the Section 4(1) exemption.” _Cavanagh,_ 445 F.3d at 111 (cleaned up).

[.text-justify]
The Court need not reach this issue. Like Ripple’s Programmatic Sales, Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s XRP sales were programmatic sales on various digital asset exchanges through blind bid/ask transactions. _See_ SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 280–84, 306–09. Larsen and Garlinghouse did not know to whom they sold XRP, and the buyers did not know the identity of the seller. Thus, as a matter of law, the record cannot establish the third _Howey_ prong as to these transactions. For substantially the same reasons discussed above, _supra_ § II.B.2, Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s offer and sale of XRP on digital asset exchanges did not amount to offers and sales of investment contracts.^*(xref:sec_ripple_footnote_19[19])*^

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;5&period; Defendants’ Due Process Defenses

[.text-justify]
Defendants each assert a “fair notice” defense, claiming that the SEC violated their due process rights; Larsen and Garlinghouse also assert an as-applied vagueness defense based on the same due process principles. _See_ Defs. Opp. at 43 & n.28; _see also_ ECF No. 51 at 97–99; ECF No. 462 at 97–99; ECF No. 463 at 103–05.

[.text-justify]
“A fundamental principle in our legal system is that laws which regulate persons or entities must give fair notice of conduct that is forbidden or required.” _FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.,_ 567 U.S. 239, 253 (2012). This clarity requirement is “essential to the protections provided by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,” and “requires the invalidation of laws that are impermissibly vague.” _Id._ Laws fail to comport with due process when they (1) “fail[] to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited,” or (2) are so standardless that they authorize or encourage “seriously discriminatory enforcement.” _Id._ (citation omitted).

[.text-justify]
This “assessment cannot be conducted in the abstract; rather . . . the party claiming a lack of notice [must] show[] ‘that the statute in question provided insufficient notice that his or her behavior at issue was prohibited.’” ECF No. 440 at 8 (quoting _Copeland v. Vance,_ 893 F.3d 101, 110 (2d Cir. 2018)). “[T]he evaluation of any fair notice defense is objective—it does not require inquiry into ‘whether a particular [party] actually received a warning that alerted him or her to the danger of being held to account for the behavior in question.’” _Id._ at 10 n.5 (quoting _United States v. Smith,_ 985 F. Supp. 2d 547, 587 (S.D.N.Y. 2014), _aff’d sub nom. United States v. Halloran,_ 664 F. App’x 23 (2d Cir. 2016)).

[.text-justify]
The Court rejects Defendants’ fair notice and vagueness defenses as to the Institutional Sales. First, the caselaw that defines an investment contract provides a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it covers. _See Copeland,_ 893 F.3d at 114. _Howey_ sets forth a clear test for determining what constitutes an investment contract, and Howey’s progeny provides guidance on how to apply that test to a variety of factual scenarios. _See Smith,_ 985 F. Supp. 2d at 588 (“[I]t is not only the language of a statute that can provide the requisite fair notice; judicial decisions interpreting that statute can do so as well.”). That is constitutionally sufficient to satisfy due process. _See United States v. Zaslavskiy,_ No. 17 Cr. 647, 2018 WL 4346339, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 11, 2018) (“[T]he abundance of caselaw interpreting and applying _Howey_ at all levels of the judiciary, as well as related guidance issued by the SEC as to the scope of its regulatory authority and enforcement power, provide all the notice that is constitutionally required.”).

[.text-justify]
Second, the caselaw articulates sufficiently clear standards to eliminate the risk of arbitrary enforcement. _Howey_ is an objective test that provides the flexibility necessary for the assessment of a wide range of contracts, transactions, and schemes. Defendants focus on the SEC’s failure to issue guidance on digital assets and its inconsistent statements and approaches to regulating the sale of digital assets as investment contracts. _See_ Defs. Opp. at 45–52. But the SEC’s approach to enforcement, at least as to the Institutional Sales,^*(xref:sec_ripple_footnote_20[20])*^ is consistent with the enforcement actions that the agency has brought relating to the sale of other digital assets to buyers pursuant to written contracts and for the purpose of fundraising. _See, e.g., Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d 352; _Kik_, 492 F. Supp. 3d 169. Moreover, the law does not require the SEC to warn all potential violators on an individual or industry level. _See Dickerson v. Napolitano,_ 604 F.3d 732, 745–46 (2d Cir. 2010) (“Courts ask whether the law presents an ordinary person with sufficient notice of or the opportunity to understand what conduct is prohibited or proscribed, not whether a particular [party] actually received a warning that alerted him or her to the danger of being held to account for the behavior in question.” (cleaned up)).

[.text-justify]
Accordingly, the SEC’s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to the Institutional Sales and otherwise DENIED, and Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to the Programmatic Sales, the Other Distributions, and Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s sales, and DENIED as to the Institutional Sales.

&emsp;&emsp;C&period; Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s Aiding and Abetting of Ripple’s Violations

[.text-justify]
The SEC also moves for summary judgment on its aiding and abetting claim against Larsen and Garlinghouse. _See_ SEC Mem. at 66. To establish liability for aiding and abetting a securities violation, the SEC must show: +
[.quoteblock .text-justify]#&nbsp; +
(1) the existence of a securities law violation by the primary (as opposed to the aiding and abetting) party; +
(2) knowledge of this violation on the part of the aider and abettor; and +
(3) substantial assistance by the aider and abettor in the achievement of the primary violation.#+
_SEC v. Apuzzo,_ 689 F.3d 204, 206 (2d Cir. 2012) (cleaned up). Courts cannot consider the three requirements in isolation from one another because “[s]atisfaction of the knowledge requirement will depend on the theory of primary liability, and there may be a nexus between the degree of knowledge and the requirement that the alleged aider and abettor render substantial assistance.” _SEC v. Espuelas,_ 905 F. Supp. 2d 507, 517 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting _SEC v. DiBella,_ 587 F.3d 553, 566 (2d Cir. 2009)). Indeed, courts have found that “‘[a] high degree of substantial assistance may lessen the SEC’s burden in proving scienter’ and vice versa.” _SEC v. Wey,_ 246 F. Supp. 3d 894, 928 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (quoting _Apuzzo,_ 689 F.3d at 215).

[.text-justify]
As to the first requirement, the Court has already held that Ripple’s Institutional Sales constituted the unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act. _See supra_ § II.B.1.

[.text-justify]
With respect to the second requirement, to show knowledge of Ripple’s violations, the SEC must demonstrate Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s “general awareness of their overall role in Ripple’s illegal scheme.” MTD Order at 15; _see SEC v. Yorkville Advisors, LLC,_ 305 F. Supp. 3d 486, 511 (S.D.N.Y. 2018); Dodd-Frank Wall St. Reform & Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, § 929O (2010) (codified at 15 U.S.C. § 78t(e)). The SEC need not demonstrate that Larsen and Garlinghouse were aware that Ripple’s transactions and schemes were illegal. _See SEC v. Mattessich,_ 407 F. Supp. 3d 264, 272–73 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). Rather, the SEC must show that Larsen and Garlinghouse knew, or recklessly disregarded, the facts that made Ripple’s transactions and schemes illegal under statutory and caselaw. _See id._

[.text-justify]
Based on the record, Defendants have raised a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Larsen and Garlinghouse knew or recklessly disregarded the facts that made Ripple’s scheme illegal. _See_ MTD Order at 15. It is not clear whether Larsen and Garlinghouse knew or recklessly disregarded that securities laws, rather than laws under other regulatory regimes, applied to XRP. For instance, Larsen and Garlinghouse testified that they did not believe XRP was a security because multiple foreign regulators, including regulators in Japan, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom, had determined that XRP was not a security. SEC Add. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 1744, 1782. Larsen and Garlinghouse also stated that when the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network labeled XRP a “virtual currency” in 2015, they understood this as an “official United States government declaration that XRP [was] a currency” and “exempt from [U.S.] securities laws.” _Id._ ¶¶ 1734, 1759–60. Larsen further testified that he understood the 2018 speech by the then-Director of the SEC Division of Corporate Finance, Bill Hinman—in which he stated that neither bitcoin nor ether (another digital asset) were securities—to further reinforce the SEC’s position that XRP was not a security. _See id._ ¶¶ 1742–43.

[.text-justify]
The October 2012 Perkins Coie memorandum, which Larsen reviewed, advises, “[a]lthough we believe that a compelling argument can be made that [XRP tokens] do not constitute ‘securities’ under the federal securities laws, given the lack of applicable [caselaw], we believe that there is some risk, albeit small, that the [SEC] disagrees with our analysis.” Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 993; _see_ ECF No. 846-30 at 6. Larsen testified that after receiving the memorandum, Ripple took specific steps to ensure compliance with the advice contained within the memorandum. Defs. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 1730.

[.text-justify]
Likewise, Defendants have raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Larsen and Garlinghouse knew or recklessly disregarded facts about each of the _Howey_ elements. For example, Defendants have adduced evidence that Larsen and Garlinghouse did not know that Ripple’s Institutional Sales of XRP satisfied the _Howey_ “common enterprise” element because they did not believe that the proceeds from the sales were pooled and understood that Ripple did not manage, operate, or control the XRP Ledger or the broader “XRP ecosystem.” _See id._ ¶¶ 1748–50. Based on the disputed facts in the record, therefore, a reasonable juror could find that Larsen and Garlinghouse did not know or recklessly disregard Ripple’s Section 5 violations. _See Apuzzo,_ 689 F.3d at 206.

[.text-justify]
As to the third requirement, Defendants concede that Larsen, as Ripple’s CEO prior to 2017, provided substantial assistance, and Garlinghouse, after becoming Ripple’s CEO in January 2017, provided substantial assistance. _See_ Defs. Opp. at 71. However, Larsen claims that he did not provide substantial assistance during his time as Executive Chairman of Ripple’s Board, starting in 2017. _See id._

[.text-justify]
To satisfy the substantial assistance component of aiding and abetting, the “SEC must show that the defendant in some sort associated himself with the venture, that he participated in it as in something that he wished to bring about, and that he sought by his action to make it succeed.” _Apuzzo,_ 689 F.3d at 206 (cleaned up). In other words, the defendant must “consciously assist the commission of the specific crime in some active way.” _SEC v. Mudd,_ 885 F. Supp. 2d 654, 670–71 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (cleaned up).

[.text-justify]
Here, Larsen has raised a triable issue of material fact as to whether he provided “substantial assistance” beginning in 2017. _See Anderson,_ 477 U.S. at 248. The record establishes that, starting in 2017, Larsen moved away from a day-to-day operational role at Ripple. _See_ SEC Add. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 1722–29. But after he stepped down as CEO, Larsen also continued his role on the XRP Sales Committee, which approved Ripple’s sales of XRP. _See_ Defs. 56.1 Resp. Part 2 ¶ 1099, ECF No. 835-1. The Court concludes, therefore, that a reasonable jury could find that, starting in 2017, Larsen did not “consciously assist [Ripple’s Section 5 violations] in some active way.” _Mudd,_ 885 F. Supp. 2d at 670–71 (cleaned up).

[.text-justify]
Accordingly, the SEC’s motion for summary judgment on the aiding and abetting claim against Larsen and Garlinghouse is DENIED.

[.text-center]
*CONCLUSION*

[.text-justify]
&emsp;For the foregoing reasons, the SEC’s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to the Institutional Sales, and otherwise DENIED. Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to the Programmatic Sales, the Other Distributions, and Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s sales, and DENIED as to the Institutional Sales.

[.text-justify]
&emsp;The Court shall issue a separate order setting a trial date and related pre-trial deadlines in due course.

. [[sec_ripple_footnote_1]]Portions of the briefs, Rule 56.1 statements, and other documents discussed in this order were filed under seal or redacted. _See_ ECF No. 819 (granting in part and denying in part the parties’ and third parties’ motions to seal). These materials are “judicial documents” because they are “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process.” _Lugosch v.

To the extent that information in these documents is disclosed in this order, the privacy and business interests that justified their sealing or redaction are outweighed by “the public’s right of access to [information] necessary to understand the basis for court rulings.” Spinelli v. Nat’l Football League, 903 F.3d 185, 193 n.2 (2d Cir. 2018); _see also_ Dodona I, LLC v. Goldman, Sachs & Co., 119 F. Supp. 3d 152, 155 (S.D.N.Y. 2015).

Citations to a paragraph in a Rule 56.1 statement also include the opposing party’s response. “[W]here there are no citations[,] or where the cited materials do not support the factual assertions in the [s]tatements, the Court is free to disregard the assertion.” Holtz v. Rockefeller & Co., 258 F.3d 62, 73 (2d Cir. 2001) (alteration omitted).

[[sec_ripple_footnote_3]] A blockchain is an electronically distributed database or ledger “shared among a computer network’s nodes.” _See_ Adam Hayes, Blockchain Facts: What Is It, How It Works, and How It Can Be Used, Investopedia (updated Apr. 23, 2023), https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp/. A blockchain is a system for recording information. Each transaction is recorded as a “block” of data on the digital ledger, which is connected to the blocks before and after it. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 1, ECF No. 842. Blockchains are typically recorded across a distributed network of computers. _Id._ ¶ 2. 
. [[sec_ripple_footnote_4]] Ripple was originally named NewCoin, Inc. and incorporated under California law. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 33. It was then renamed OpenCoin, Inc. in October 2012. _Id._ In 2013, the company was renamed Ripple Labs, Inc., and in 2014, it was incorporated under Delaware law. _Id._ In this order, the Court shall refer to the company as Ripple, even when referring to its forerunners, NewCoin and OpenCoin.

. [[sec_ripple_footnote_5]] Since 2012, Ripple has also raised investment capital through multiple funding rounds in which it sold stock to investors. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶ 34. Ripple has issued millions of shares of common stock, as well as convertible notes, preferred stock, and a stock warrant. SEC Add. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 1607, 1609, ECF No. 844.

. [[sec_ripple_footnote_6]] Ripple also distributed XRP for free to “early adopters and developers” and to charities and grant recipients. SEC 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 92–94. The SEC does not include these transactions in its complaint. _See_ SEC Opp. at 26 n.15, ECF No. 841.

. [[sec_ripple_footnote_8]] The SEC’s Rule 56.1 statement contains over 1,600 purported facts—many of which are disputed by Defendants— and cites over 900 exhibits. _See_ generally Defs. 56.1 Resp. The Court highlights below only those documents and statements directly relevant to this order.
. [[sec_ripple_footnote_9]] Accredify, Inc. did not formally file an amicus brief after the Court granted leave to do so, _see_ ECF No. 704, but included its brief as an attachment to its original request, _see_ ECF No. 698.
. [[sec_ripple_footnote_10]] On November 4, 2022, the Court directed that any requests to file amicus briefs be filed by November 11, 2022. ECF No. 695. William M. Cunningham and Anoop Bungay, both pro se litigants, each separately requested leave to file an amicus brief on November 16, 2022, and January 20, 2023, respectively. ECF Nos. 712, 807. Cunningham’s and Bungay’s requests are DENIED as untimely.
. [[sec_ripple_footnote_11]] The SEC’s opposition papers misconstrue Defendants’ “essential ingredients” test. The SEC dedicates several pages to refuting the argument that a written contract must exist, _see_ SEC Opp. at 19–24, but Defendants’ proposed test does not turn on the need for a written contract as opposed to an oral or implied contract, _see_ Defs. Mem. at 2, 18–19; Defs. Reply at 9, ECF No. 832. Therefore, the Court does not address the SEC’s arguments that _Howey_ does not require the existence of a written contract. _See_ SEC Opp. at 19–24.
. [[sec_ripple_footnote_12]] The SEC also argues that the record establishes strict vertical commonality. _See_ SEC Mem. at 51–53. The Second Circuit has not addressed whether the strict vertical commonality theory can give rise to a common enterprise. _See_ Revak, 18 F.3d at 88. In this case, because horizontal commonality establishes the existence of a common enterprise, the Court does not reach the issue of strict vertical commonality or its viability as a theory.
. [[sec_ripple_footnote_13]] The Court holds only that a common enterprise existed between Ripple and the Institutional Buyers. The Court does not reach the question of whether the common enterprise extends to encompass “other XRP holders,” Defendants Garlinghouse and Larsen, the “XRP ecosystem,” or any other entities. Cf. Defs. Opp. at 20–21. 
. [[sec_ripple_footnote_14]] _Howey_ contemplates that an investor is “led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.” 328 U.S. at 298–99. However, the Second Circuit “ha[s] held that the word ‘solely’ should not be construed as a literal limitation; rather, [courts] ‘consider whether, under all the circumstances, the scheme was being promoted primarily as an investment or as a means whereby participants could pool their own activities, their money and the promoter’s contribution in a meaningful way.’” United States v. Leonard, 529 F.3d 83, 88 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting SEC v. Aqua-Sonic Prods. Corp., 687 F.2d 577, 582 (2d Cir. 1982)).
. [[sec_ripple_footnote_15]] The Court holds only that Ripple’s sales of XRP to the Institutional Buyers were offers and sales of investment contracts. To the extent the SEC instead argues that Ripple actually sold investment contracts to the public and used the Institutional Buyers as underwriters, the Court rejects that argument. Cf. SEC Mem. at 63–65. 
. [[sec_ripple_footnote_16]] The Court does not address whether secondary market sales of XRP constitute offers and sales of investment contracts because that question is not properly before the Court. Whether a secondary market sale constitutes an offer or sale of an investment contract would depend on the totality of circumstances and the economic reality of that specific contract, transaction, or scheme. _See Marine Bank,_ 455 U.S. at 560 n.11; _Telegram,_ 448 F. Supp. 3d at 379; _see also_ ECF No. 105 at 34:14-16, _LBRY,_ No. 21 Civ. 260 (D.N.H. Jan. 30, 2023) (declining to extend holding to include secondary sales).
. [[sec_ripple_footnote_17]] Because the Court finds that the record does not establish the third _Howey_ prong as to the Programmatic Sales, the Court does not reach whether the first or second _Howey_ prongs have been satisfied. 
. [[sec_ripple_footnote_18]] Because the Court determines that the record does not establish the first _Howey_ prong as to the Other Distributions, the Court does not reach whether the second or third _Howey_ prongs have been satisfied.
. [[sec_ripple_footnote_19]] For the reasons stated, the Court need not address Defendants’ argument that Larsen and Garlinghouse are entitled to summary judgment on offers and sales on “foreign exchanges.” _See_ Defs. Mem. at 58–74.
. [[sec_ripple_footnote_20]] Because the Court finds that only the Institutional Sales constituted the offer and sale of investment contracts, the Court does not address Defendants’ asserted fair notice defense as to the other transactions and schemes. The Court’s holding is limited to the Institutional Sales because the SEC’s theories as to the other sales in this case are potentially inconsistent with its enforcement in prior digital asset cases. _See Upton v. SEC,_ 75 F.3d 92, 98 (2d Cir. 1996).

|===

JED S. RAKOFF, U.S.D.J.: 

[.text-justify]
In this case, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) alleges that the defendants -- Terraform Labs Pte Ltd., a “cryptoassets” company, and its Founder, Chief Executive Officer and majority shareholder, Do Hyeong Kwon -- orchestrated a multibillion-dollar fraud involving the development, marketing, and sale of various cryptocurrencies. The defendants have moved to dismiss the SEC’s Amended Complaint. After full briefing, the Court, on June 14, 2023, heard oral argument on the motion. Having now carefully considered the parties’ arguments, the Court concludes that because, according to the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint, the defendants used false and materially misleading statements to entice U.S. investors to purchase and hold on to defendants’ products, and because those products were unregistered investment-contract securities that enabled investors to profit from the supposed investment activities of defendants and others, the motion to dismiss must be denied.

&emsp; *I&period;&emsp; [underline]#Factual Allegations#*

[.text-justify]
Unless otherwise noted, the following factual allegations are taken from the SEC’s Amended Complaint, Dkt. No. 25. For purposes of this motion, all well-plead allegations must be taken as true, and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be drawn in the SEC’s favor. See Buon v. Spindler, 65 F.4th 64, 76 (2d Cir. 2023). 

&emsp; *A&period;&emsp; [underline]#The Defendants and the “Crypto-Assets” at Issue#*

[.text-justify]
Defendant Terraform Labs, Pte Ltd. (“Terraform”) is a Singapore-based company that develops, markets, and sells “cryptoassets,” including cryptocurrencies, and co-defendant Do Keyong Kwon is the company’s Founder, Chief Executive Officer, and majority shareholder, holding 92 percent of the company’s shares. See Dkt. No. 25, (“Amended Complaint”) ¶ 1, 16. Terraform and Kwon are best known for developing and selling the Terra USD cryptocurrency (the “UST coin”) and a “companion” cryptocurrency called the “LUNA” coin. Id. ¶ 4. 

[.text-justify]
The first of these -- the UST coin -- is a “stablecoin,” a kind of cryptocurrency whose price is algorithmically pegged to another asset, such as a fiat currency or exchange-traded commodity. Id. ¶ 7. Theoretically, stablecoins like the UST coin can serve as useful mediums of exchange, since the coin’s stable value -- assuming it maintains its peg -- may assure buyers and sellers that the coin will retain purchasing power over time. See New to the Crypto World? Here Are Terms to Know, N.Y. Times (June 8, 2022).  

[.text-justify]
In the case of the UST coin, each coin was pegged to the U.S. dollar and, for a time, could be purchased and sold for exactly $1.00. Amended Complaint ¶ 33. At any point, an owner of a UST coin could swap their coin for $1.00 worth of the companion coin, LUNA. Likewise, any holder of a LUNA coin could exchange that coin for $1.00 in UST coin. This fixed relationship theoretically ensured that the value of coins stayed fixed at $1.00. Id. 

[.text-justify]
The defendants also marketed and sold three other types of “crypto-assets.” The first of these was a version of the LUNA coin called “wLUNA.” Id. ¶ 39. Where LUNA coins were available only for use on the Terraform blockchain (described below), the wLUNA version allowed holders of LUNA to use LUNA coins in transactions on other, non-Terraform blockchains. Id. ¶¶ 59-61. A second offering, mAssets, functioned as “security-based swaps” whose value “mirrored” the price of securities exchanged on stock exchanges.  Id. ¶ 37. By rising or falling in parallel to the price of a given security, the mAsset allowed traders to gauge the risk of investing in that security without “the burdens of owning or transacting real assets.” Id. The third additional crypto-asset was a “MIR” token that allowed its holders to share in the fees generated by the “Mirror Protocol” (also described below). 

&emsp; *B&period;&emsp; [underline]#The Defendants Create the Terraform Blockchain and Related Crypto-Assets#*

[.text-justify]
In April 2019, Terraform, Kwon, and another co-founder officially launched a blockchain to house transactions using the UST and LUNA coins, which they called the Terraform blockchain.^*(xref:terraform_opinion_order_fn_1[1])*^  On the same day, the defendants created one billion LUNA tokens and, a few months later, began producing the first of the UST coins. See id. ¶¶ 34, 36. Demand for the UST coins, however, was slow to grow. Id. ¶ 36. In the first two months of 2021, the total amount of UST coins in circulation hovered just under 300 million, indicating that many holders of LUNA coins had not exchanged their coins for UST coins. Id.

[.text-justify]
In response, Terraform and Kwon began in September 2020 marketing UST coins as profitable investment opportunities -- as opposed to just stable stores of value -- in meetings with U.S. investors, investment conferences in major U.S. cities, and on social media platforms. Id. ¶¶ 35, 43.  Beginning in December 2020, for instance, the defendants unveiled the “Mirror Protocol,” a program under which the defendants would, for a fee, issue “mAssets” to investors that -- as noted above –- were designed to help investors maximize their profits and minimize their risk from trading traditional stocks. Id. ¶ 37. Then, in March 2021, the defendants launched a mechanism that would transform the UST coins into “yield-bearing” stablecoins, a program known as the “Anchor Protocol.” Id. ¶ 35.

[.text-justify]
At bottom, the “Anchor Protocol” was an investment pool into which owners of UST coins could deposit their coins and earn a share of whatever profits the pool generated. Id. ¶ 36. By advertising rates of returns of 19-20% on the coin owners’ initial investment and touting the “deep relevant experience” of the Terraform team, the defendants generated enormous demand for the UST coins. Id. ¶¶ 36, 40. By May 2022, there were about 19 billion UST coins in circulation, with 14 billion deposited in the Anchor Protocol. Id. Indeed, at that time, UST had a total market value of over $17 billion, making it among the world’s most popular cryptocurrency products. Id. ¶ 4.

[.text-justify]
Terraform and Kwon represented to investors that the continued profitability of the UST coins and the Anchor Protocol depended on the development of the broader Terraform “ecosystem,” which, they said, would grow in proportion to the volume of transactions on the blockchain. Id. ¶¶ 39, 51-52. To encourage more transactions, Kwon and others at Terraform promised investors that they would devote much of the company’s earnings to expanding and improving the Terraform ecosystem and its crypto-asset products. Id. ¶ 47. For instance, at various points when revenues from the “Anchor Protocol” investments did not cover the advertised returns to UST depositors, Terraform injected millions of dollars from its reserves -- which included a $50 million dollar fund named the “LUNA Foundation Guard” -- to ensure depositors received the money they were promised. Id. ¶ 78.

[.text-justify]
Not only did the defendants develop and market these cryptoassets, but they offered and sold them in unregistered transactions. Id. ¶ 105. Indeed, from April through September 2018, the defendants contracted to sell close to 200 million LUNA coins to institutional investors in the United States and elsewhere, with Kwon signing the purchase agreements. Id. ¶ 107. 
Then, in November 2019 and September 2020 -- seeking to reverse “the lackluster performance of LUNA” in that year by “improving liquidity” -- the defendants loaned nearly 100 million LUNA coins to a U.S. trading firm. Id. ¶ 108.

[.text-justify]
These transactions, in the SEC’s view, amounted to unlawful public distributions of securities because the defendants imposed no restrictions on the resale of the LUNA tokens by their new possessors and, indeed, made the sales with the understanding that the tokens would be resold to the public. Id. ¶ 105-109. The SEC alleges, moreover, that the defendants violated laws prohibiting the unregistered offering and sale of securities and securitybased swaps in a more straightforward way: by directly offering and selling MIR tokens, mAssets, and LUNA tokens on crypto-asset marketplaces. Id. ¶¶ 111-113.

[.text-justify]
According to the SEC, the defendants also defrauded investors through the development, promotion, and sale of these cryptoassets. Although Terraform and Kwon represented that the coins were stable investments and would always retain their value, this was not the case. And in May 2021, the UST coin’s value dropped below $1.00. At that point, realizing that investors harbored serious doubts about the UST coins and that the coin would not return to a value of $1.00 by itself, Terraform and Kwon persuaded a third-party trading firm based in the United States to buy a large number of UST coins in an effort to artificially restore the coin’s $1.00 peg. Id. ¶ 166. While UST returned to $1.00 through this agreement, Kwon and Terraform concealed the true reason the calamity had been adverted, instead touting the restoration of the peg as a triumph of the “automatically self-heal[ing]” UST/LUNA algorithm. Id. ¶ 7.

[.text-justify]
This artificial secret arrangement restored confidence among investors, who poured billions of dollars into the Terraform ecosystem. Id. ¶ 8. Exactly one year later, however, the market for UST coins crashed. In April 2022, the market price of LUNA reached a high point of $119.18 per coin. Id. ¶ 56. The next month, the UST coin’s value declined below $1.00 after many investors converted their tokens into LUNA coins or sold them altogether. Id. ¶ 9. Because, this time, there was no external intervention to prop up the price of the coins, the value of both UST and LUNA plummeted to under a penny, wiping out over $40 billion of total market value for investors. Id. ¶ 1.

[.text-justify]
Terraform also fraudulently misstated the real-world utility of its coins. In particular, they told investors that users of “Chai” – a Korean phone application used by consumers and merchants to send and receive payments – were using Terraform’s stablecoins and blockchain to execute transactions on the platform. Id. ¶¶ 121-134. The defendants told investors that this partnership would generate enormous fees for the company that would redound to investors. See, e.g., id. at 130. These claims, however, were false. In essence, the defendants fabricated transactions to make it appear as if Chai users were using Terraform’s products when, in reality, all transactions on Chai took place exclusively on the Chai platform and involved only Korean currency. Id. ¶ 142.

[.text-justify]
On these allegations, the SEC asserts five claims for relief in its Amended Complaint. First, they allege that the defendants committed fraud in the sale of their crypto-assets in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act. Second, and similarly, they allege that the same fraudulently-induced sales violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Third, they allege that Kwon, as Terraform’s CEO and co-founder, is jointly and severally liable with Terraform for any securities’ law violations committed by Terraform. Fourth, they allege that the defendants failed to register the offer and sale of Terraform’s crypto-assets as required by the securities laws. Fifth, they allege that the defendants offered, sold and effected transactions of security-based swaps -- namely, its “mAssets” product -- to individuals who were not “eligible contract participants,” as that term is defined by statute and regulation.

&emsp; *II&period;&emsp; [underline]#Legal Standards#*

[.text-justify]
Terraform and Kwon move to dismiss the SEC’s Amended Complaint both for lack of personal jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure Rule 12(b)(2) and for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6).

[.text-justify]
To defeat a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2), a plaintiff must, through its factual allegations, make a prima facie showing that the Court has jurisdiction over the defendants. This burden is satisfied if the factual allegations contained in the complaint, taken as true, demonstrate two things:

[.text-justify]
First, the allegations must show that the defendants “purposefully directed” their activities at the forum state (in this case, the United States), thereby “avail[ing] [themselves] of the privilege[s] of conducting activities” in that state, including “the protections of its laws.” Burger King Corp. v. 
Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 472 (1985). The touchstone, here, is whether the defendants could reasonably “foresee being haled into court” in the forum state because of their activities in that state. Kernan v. Kurz-Hastings, Inc., 175 F.3d 236, 243 (2d Cir. 1999).^*(xref:terraform_opinion_order_fn_2[2])*^

[.text-justify]
Second, the plaintiff must also show that the alleged injuries “arise out of or relate to” the activities that the defendants directed at the forum state. Burger King, 471 U.S. at 472-73. Precisely how related the alleged harms and the defendants’ activities need be to establish personal jurisdiction depends on the “substantiality of [the defendants’] contacts” with the forum. SPV OSUS Ltd. v. UBS AG, 114 F. Supp. 3d 161, 169 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). Where, for instance, the defendants have “only limited contacts with the state,” the plaintiff must show that those contacts proximately caused the harm complained of. Id. The corollary is that proximate causation may not be strictly required if the defendants’ contacts are extensive. See Chew v. Dietrich, 143 F.3d 24, 29 (2d Cir. 1998).  

[.text-justify]
As for the defendants’ alternate ground for its motion to dismiss, a complaint survives a motion to dismiss brought under Rule 12(b)(6) if it contains “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). A claim, in turn, bears facial plausibility where it is supported by “factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable Inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 
662, 678 (2009). In other words, a complaint that offers only “labels and conclusions,” bereft of factual support, or one that alleges facts evincing a “sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully” will not do. Id. If the plaintiff has not “nudged [its] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible, [the claims] must be dismissed.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570. 

[.text-justify]
Finally, at all times for purposes of this motion, the Court must “construe the pleadings and affidavits in the light most favorable to [the] plaintiff[]” and resolve all factual “doubts in [the plaintiff’s] favor.” Dorchester Fin. Sec., Inc. v. Banco BRJ, S.A., 722 F.3d 81, 85 (2d Cir. 2013).  

&emsp; *III&period;&emsp; [underline]#Discussion#*

[.text-justify]
With these standards in mind, the Court first assesses the defendants’ motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) and then under Rule 12(b)(6).

&emsp; *A&period;&emsp; The SEC has adequately pled that the Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendants.*

[.text-justify]
Terraform and Kwon argue that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over them under the Due Process Clause. That Clause -- the fount of the personal jurisdiction requirement -- dictates that federal jurisdiction can be exercised only over defendants who direct their actions toward residents of a particular state, in this case, the United States.^*(xref:terraform_opinion_order_fn_3[3])*^  See Burger King, 471 U.S. at 471.

[.text-justify]
For over a century, this “minimum contacts” rule has struck a fair balance between, on the one hand, a state’s interest in holding those who benefit from its laws accountable to those same laws and, on the other hand, an individual’s right to “fair warning” about what sorts of activities will expose the individual to legal liability. See Ford Motor Co. v. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 141 S. Ct. 1017, 1025 (2021). To that end, a defendant cannot be “haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts,” but must be carried there by actions that suggest a manifest intent to benefit from the forum’s markets or laws, such as an offer to sell goods to residents of that forum. Burger King, 471 U.S. at 475.

[.text-justify]
Here, the defendants argue that none of their actions reflects such an intent. On their telling, the activities that the SEC offers as the basis for specific jurisdiction -- namely, the company’s efforts to offer and sell its crypto-assets -- were aimed generally at investors all over the world and thus not “purposefully directed” at potential investors in the United States. Id at 472. In the defendants’ view, subjecting them to federal jurisdiction based on such incidental contacts with the United States would vitiate the protections afforded them by the Due Process Clause. See id. at 471.

[.text-justify]
For its part, the SEC maintains that its allegations of direct sales of the company’s crypto-products to United States firms -- carried out, they claim, through the United States banking system -- and the defendants’ efforts to market their products at meetings in the United States suffice to show an intent to conduct business in the United States. Moreover, the SEC insists the Second Circuit has already ruled in a related, earlier action that courts in this district have jurisdiction over the defendants. See U.S. Sec. & Exchange Comm. v. Terraform Labs Pte Ltd., 2022 WL 2066414 (2d Cir. June 8, 2022).

[.text-justify]
The SEC has the better of the argument and, this Court concludes, has satisfied its jurisdictional burden. For starters, the Second Circuit has already opined on this very issue and concluded, in no uncertain terms, that the defendants “purposefully availed themselves of the [United States] by promoting the digital assets at issue” -- namely, those related to the Mirror Protocol –- “to U.S.-based consumers and investors.” Id. at *3. The panel’s conclusion, in essence, rested on the defendants’ “extensive U.S. contacts,” “including marketing and promotion to U.S. consumers, retention of U.S. based employees, contracts with U.S.-based entities, and business trips to the U.S., all of which relate to ... the digital assets at issue.” Id. at *4. And all the contacts identified by the Second Circuit as bases for their decision are re-alleged by the SEC in its Amended Complaint here.

[.text-justify]
Defendants offer two reasons why the Second Circuit’s decision is “not dispositive here,” see Defs.’ Reply Br. at 1, but neither reason is persuasive. First, they argue that the Second Circuit “considered whether there was personal jurisdiction to enforce an investigative subpoena directed to a non-party” and did not determine, generally, that there was personal jurisdiction over the defendants. Id. But the panel’s decision contains no such qualification. Though the Second Circuit’s ruling on personal jurisdiction was made in the context of a dispute over a subpoena, there is nothing that suggests its conclusions were limited to that context. Indeed, the word “subpoena” does not even appear in the section of the decision on personal jurisdiction. See Terraform Labs, 2022 WL 2066414, at *3-4

[.text-justify]
Second, defendants argue that the Second Circuit’s ruling, to the extent it is relevant at all, has no bearing on the issue of personal jurisdiction over the main crypto-assets at issue here: the LUNA and UST tokens. Personal jurisdiction, they point out, exists only where alleged harms “arise out of or relate to” the defendants’ contacts. Defs.’ Reply Br. at 2. Because the prior Second Circuit case involved only the MIR tokens and mAssets, the panel had no basis to consider whether defendants’ activities as to the LUNA or UST tokens “gave rise” to any cognizable injury. It follows, in their view, that the Second Circuit’s ruling says nothing about whether jurisdiction can be exercised based on the defendants’ offer and sale of its LUNA and UST tokens.

[.text-justify]
Here, again, the defendants point to a distinction without a difference. Though the Second Circuit’s decision applied only to the company’s mAssets and MIR Tokens, the case for personal jurisdiction based on the defendants’ LUNA- and UST-related activities is, if anything, even stronger. While in the prior case, for instance, the SEC carried its burden by alleging that the defendants sold $200,000 of the Mirror Protocol coins to one U.S.based trading platform, here, the SEC’s allegation is that the defendants sold and loaned several million dollars’ worth of LUNA and UST to several U.S. firms. See Amended Complaint ¶¶ 7-8, 107109; Exhs. PP, QQ, RR, SS. Also, it would defy logic to accept, as defendants argue the Court should, that contracts between the defendants and U.S. firms to sell the defendants’ products are not enough to establish personal jurisdiction just because the marketing efforts that ended in these contracts were directed at global investors. At this stage, an allegation that a defendant “negotiat[ed] and form[ed] a contract with a [United States] corporation” is normally enough, by itself, to support jurisdiction. U.S. Titan, Inc. v. Guangzhou Zhen Hua Shipping Co., Ltd., 241 F.3d 135, 152-53 (2d Cir. 2001).

[.text-justify]
Nor can the defendants evade federal jurisdiction by claiming that these transactions involved the offshore subsidiaries of the parties to the contract, and not the parties themselves. To begin with, this defense does not apply at all to one of the contracts, which can, by itself, support jurisdiction. Specifically, the defendants directly promised to lend 30 million LUNA coins to a company based in the United States, Jump Trading Co., and not through an offshore entity. See Dkt. 33, Exhs. RR, SS. Even one such contract, “negotia[ted] and form[ed] ... with a [United States] corporation,” suffices for jurisdiction. U.S. Titan, Inc, 241 F.3d at 152-53.

[.text-justify]
But even as to the contract between Terraform’s subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands and a California-based trading firm, a plaintiff may still establish personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation based on its subsidiary’s purposeful contacts with the United States if that subsidiary is a “mere department” of the foreign parent corporation. Janzini v. Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., 148 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir. 1998). A foreign corporation, in other words, cannot use a subsidiary that serves no other purpose than as a shield against legal liability to block federal jurisdiction. Otherwise, rather than serve the values of “fair notice” and individual liberty, the Due Process Clause would be reduced to facilitating pure gamesmanship.

[.text-justify]
Here, the SEC, if we assume the Amended Complaint’s allegations to be true, have adequately pled that the defendants’ BVI subsidiary is a “mere department” of Terraform itself. As the Amended Complaint points out, the BVI entity that executed the contract was named “Terraform Labs” and the contract was signed on the BVI entity’s behalf by two co-founders of Terraform -- Mr. Kwon and Daniel Hyunsung Shin. See Amended Complaint ¶ 107; Dkt 33, Exhs. PP, QQ. These facts, at a minimum, suggest that the two companies operate under “common ownership,” that “the parent corporation interferes in the selection and assignment of the subsidiary’s executive personnel,” and that the parent company, Terraform, exercises a high “degree of control over the marketing and operation[]” of its BVI subsidiary. Jazini, 148 F.3d 181, 18485 (identifying “common ownership,” the involvement of the parent corporation in the appointment of executives, and the degree of control exercised by the parent company as factors “courts must consider” “in determining whether [a] subsidiary is a mere department of the parent”).

[.text-justify]
To be sure, it is conceivable that the discovery in this case may show that the companies feature separate ownership structures or that they operate wholly or substantially apart from one another. At this stage, however, the plaintiffs have adequately pled that the contract executed in the BVI entity’s name should be imputed to the defendants. This, in turn, means that they have established still another prima facie case for personal jurisdiction over the defendants.

[.text-justify]
Furthermore, the SEC’s argument for personal jurisdiction rests on far more than two contracts allegedly drawn up between the defendants and several U.S. firms. In their Amended Complaint, the SEC also alleges that the defendants attended meetings and investor conferences with U.S. investors, and retained U.S.-based employees whose sole duty was to solicit investment in the United States. All this amounts, as the Second Circuit put it, to “extensive U.S. contacts” that, in the Court’s view, can independently support personal jurisdiction. Terraform Labs, 2022 WL 2066414, at *4.

[.text-justify]
For the forgoing reasons, the portion of defendants’ motion that seeks dismissal under Rule 12(b)(2) is hereby denied. 

&emsp; *B&period;&emsp; The SEC is not barred from asserting that the defendants’ crypto-assets are securities.*

[.text-justify]
“The Exchange Act,” which established the SEC, “delegates to [the agency] broad authority to regulate ... securities,” but securities only. U.S. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. Alpine Sec. Corp., 308 F. Supp. 3d 775, 790 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). The statute, in other words, sets forth the bounds of the SEC’s regulatory authority by defining what sorts of products can be considered “securities” and, therefore, are subject to SEC regulation and enforcement. See 15 U.S.C. § 77b. Here, the SEC asserts that each of the defendants’ crypto-assets is an “investment contract,” one of the categories of products that the statute recognizes as a “security.” See id. (stating that “the term ‘security’ means any . . . investment contract[.]”).  

[.text-justify]
Against this backdrop, the defendants argue that the “Major Questions Doctrine,” the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) each independently prevent the SEC from alleging the company’s digital assets to be “investment contracts.” The Court considers each argument in turn.

&emsp; 1&period; [underline]#The Major Questions Doctrine#

[.text-justify]
The so-called “Major Questions Doctrine” (which is, at bottom, a principle of statutory construction) requires that in the extraordinary case where an agency claims the “power to regulate a significant portion of the American economy” that has “vast economic and political significance,” it must point to “clear congressional authorization” for that power. Util. Air Regul. Grp. 
v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014). The underlying assumption is that Congress would speak clearly -- and not through “modest words,” “vague terms,” or “subtle device[s],” -- had it intended to grant an agency the authority to make decisions that would have tremendous economic and political consequences. West Virginia v. EPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587, 2609 (2022).

[.text-justify]
Because the doctrine is reserved for the most extraordinary cases where the agency claims broad regulatory authority and the area to be regulated is one invested with particular economic and political significance, it has been rarely invoked. See West 
Virginia, 142 S. Ct. at 2608 (stating that the Major Questions Doctrine applies only in “extraordinary cases ... in which the history and breadth of the authority that the agency has asserted, and the economic and political significance of that assertion, provide a reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress meant to confer such authority”). Indeed, since its inception in FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 159 (2000), the doctrine has served as a basis for only five Supreme Court decisions. See Natasha Brunstein & Richard L. Revesz, Mangling the Major Questions Doctrine, 74 Admin. L. Rev. 217, 224-35 (2021).

[.text-justify]
In all five, the Supreme Court justified the doctrine’s application by highlighting, once again, the extraordinary nature of the agency’s claims and the exceptional importance of the industries to be regulated. In Brown & Williamson, for instance, the Supreme Court struck down an FDA regulation that would have led to the complete prohibition of tobacco products in the United 
States, an industry which, in the Court’s words, then “constitute[d] one of the greatest basic industries of the United States with ramifying activities which directly affect interstate and foreign commerce at every point, and stable conditions therein are necessary to the general welfare.” Brown & Williamson, 529 U.S. at 137. More recently, the Court deemed that the EPA’s efforts to “substantially restructure the American energy market” represented a “transformative expansion in its regulatory authority” that, absent “clear congressional authorization,” “Congress could [not] reasonably be understood to have granted.” West Virginia, 142 S. Ct. at 2610 (emphasis added).

[.text-justify]
Needless to say, there is little comparison between the instant case and the ones in which the Major Questions Doctrine was decisive. As the doctrine’s name suggests and the Supreme Court has, in case after case, emphasized, the Major Questions Doctrine is intended to apply only in extraordinary circumstances involving industries of “vast economic and political significance.” Util. Air Regul. Grp., 573 U.S. at 324. This question, moreover, of whether an industry subject to regulation is of “vast economic and political significance” should not be resolved in a vacuum. Rather, an industry can be considered to have “vast economic and political significance” only if it resembles, in these two qualities, the industries that the Supreme Court has previously said meet this definition.

[.text-justify]
With this standard in mind, the crypto-currency industry –- though certainly important –- falls far short of being a “portion of the American economy” bearing “vast economic and political significance.” Id. Put simply, it would ignore reality to place the crypto-currency industry and the American energy and tobacco industries -- the subjects of West Virginia and Brown & Williamson, respectively –- on the same plane of importance. If one were to do so, almost every large industry would qualify as one of “vast economic and political significance” and the doctrine would frustrate the administrative state’s ability to perform the function for which Congress established it: the regulation of the American economy.

[.text-justify]
Moreover, the SEC’s role is not to exercise vast economic power over the securities markets, but simply to assure that they provide adequate disclosure to investors. Thus, the SEC’s decision to require truthful marketing of certain crypto-assets based on its determination that certain of such assets are securities hardly amounts to a “transformative expansion in its regulatory authority.” West Virginia, 142 S. Ct. at 2610. It aligns, in fact, with Congress’s expectations that the SEC is to regulate “virtually any instrument that might be sold as an investment,” “in whatever form they are made and by whatever name they are called,” including novel devices like the digital assets at issue here. SEC v. Edwards, 540 U.S. 389, 393 (2004); SEC v. C.M. Joiner Leasing Corp., 320 U.S. 344, 351 (1943) (stating the term “security” was intended to capture “[n]ovel, uncommon, or irregular devices, whatever they appear to be”). Recognizing “the virtually limitless scope of human ingenuity ... in the creation of countless and variable schemes,” Congress’s decision to use general descriptive terms like investment contract in the statute was intended, not to limit the SEC’s authority to enumerated categories, but, on the contrary, to empower the SEC to interpret the statue’s terms to capture these new schemes. Reves v. Ernst & Young, 494 U.S. 56, 60–61 (1990); see also Joiner, 320 U.S. at 351.

[.text-justify]
Indeed, if the SEC were restricted (as defendant argues) to regulating only those instruments that are specifically listed by their precise names in 15 U.S.C § 77b, the statute would “embody a static” rather than “flexible” principle, the exact opposite of what Congress intended. SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 299 (1946). Strictly limiting the SEC’s authority to a few narrow categories of instruments would, moreover, contradict the Supreme Court’s instruction that “the reach of the [Exchange] Act does not stop with the obvious and commonplace,” but must extend to “[n]ovel, uncommon, or irregular devices, whatever they appear to be,” that are “widely offered [and sold]” in a way that “established their character” as a security. Joiner, 320 U.S. at 351-52. 

[.text-justify]
In sum, there is no indication that Congress intended to hamstring the SEC’s ability to resolve new and difficult questions posed by emerging technologies where these technologies impact markets that on their face appear to resemble securities markets. Defendants cannot wield a doctrine intended to be applied in exceptional circumstances as a tool to disrupt the routine work that Congress expected the SEC and other administrative agencies to perform.

[.text-justify]
&emsp; 2&period; [underline]#Due Process Clause and the APA#

[.text-justify]
Next, defendants argue that the SEC violated their due process rights by bringing this enforcement action against them without first providing them “fair notice” that their crypto-assets would be treated as securities. See FCC v. Fox Television Stations Inc., 567 U.S. 239, 253-54 (2012) (ruling that the Due Process Clause requires that agencies bringing an enforcement action “provide,” through written guidance, regulations, or other activity, “a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice” that the regulated conduct was “prohibited”).

[.text-justify]
According to the defendants, the SEC has long maintained that cryptocurrencies are not securities, but here, they claim it has for the first time taken the position that all cryptocurrencies are securities and enforced this understanding against the defendants without any prior indication that it had changed its view. This sudden about-face, the defendants say, deprived them of their constitutional right to “fair notice” and, by implication, the opportunity to conform their behavior to the SEC’s regulations.  In response, the SEC argues that it has never taken either of the black-and-white positions that the defendants ascribe to it. Indeed, rather than state that all crypto-currencies are securities or that none of them are, the SEC insists that it has broadcast the same position on this issue all along: that some crypto-currencies, depending on their particular characteristics, may qualify as securities. 

[.text-justify]
Prior to its bringing this case, moreover, the SEC asserted the exact same position it has taken in this case in several enforcement actions brought against other crypto-currency companies for allegedly fraudulent conduct in the offer and sale of their crypto-assets. See, e.g., SEC v. PlexCorps, 2018 WL 4299983, at *2-3 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018); SEC v. Zaslavskiy, 2018 WL 4346339, at *8-9 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 11, 2018). These relatively high-profile lawsuits -- which involved substantially similar allegations and millions of dollars in allegedly fraudulent crypto-currency transactions -- would have apprised a reasonable person working in the crypto-currency industry that the SEC considered some crypto-currencies to be securities and that the agency would enforce perceived violations of the securities laws through the development, marketing, and sale of these cryptocurrencies.

[.text-justify]
Following this prior litigation, moreover, a department of the SEC issued written guidance in April 2019 that admonished those 
“engaging in the offer, sale, or distribution of a digital asset” to consider “whether the digital asset is a security” that would trigger the application of “federal securities laws.” Sec. & Exchange Comm., Framework for “Investment Contract” Analysis of Digital Assets (April 2019). Within this document, the SEC also provided “a framework for analyzing whether a digital asset is an investment contract” and a list of characteristics that, if present in a given digital asset, would make the SEC more likely to view the given crypto-asset as a “security.” Id. The instant lawsuit, in sum, is just one example of the SEC’s longstanding view that some cryptocurrencies may fall within the regulatory ambit of federal securities laws.^*(xref:terraform_opinion_order_fn_4[4])*^ 

[.text-justify]
None of the statements cited by the defendant, moreover, suggests that the SEC ever operated under a contrary assumption.  
For instance, the statement of an SEC staff member that a “token … all by itself is not a security, just as the orange groves in Howey were not,” Defs.’ Br. at 13, does not amount to a concession that all cryptocurrencies are not securities. It does not, in other words, preclude the SEC from asserting, as it has here, that a token constitutes an investment contract when it is joined with a promise of future profits or the like to be generated by the offerors. The SEC’s most recent representation that digital assets “may or may not meet the definition of a ‘security’ under the [f]ederal securities laws” is even more obviously aligned with its position in this case. Securities & Exchange Comm., Release No. IA-6240, at 16 n.25 (Feb. 15, 2023).

[.text-justify]
In short, defendants’ attempt to manufacture a “fair notice” problem here comes down to asserting the SEC’s position in this litigation is inconsistent with a position that the SEC never adopted. So long as the SEC has -- through its regulations, written guidance, litigation, or other actions -- provided a reasonable person operating within the defendant’s industry fair notice that their conduct may prompt an enforcement action by the SEC, it has satisfied its obligations under the Due Process Clause.^*(xref:terraform_opinion_order_fn_5[5])*^

[.text-justify]
It follows from the foregoing that the APA also does not foreclose the SEC’s interpretation of federal securities laws to encompass the regulation of the defendants’ crypto-assets. While it may be true that, where an agency intends to promulgate “a new industry-wide policy,” notice-and-comment rulemaking -- not caseby-case adjudication -- offers a “better, fairer, and more effective” method of doing so, Cmty Television v. Gottfried, 459 U.S. 498, 511 (1983), here, as detailed above, the SEC is not announcing a new policy in this case, but merely enforcing its previously stated view that certain crypto-assets can be regulated as securities if they meet the characteristics of an “investment contract” under the Howey case (described below). Far from representing a “radical departure” from the SEC’s stated views on the law, this enforcement action is simply a “fact-intensive application of a statutory standard,” a category of agency action that has traditionally been exempt from the procedural requirements of notice-and-comment rulemaking.

[.text-justify]
To conclude, no doctrine -- whether grounded in interpretive canons, statute, or the federal Constitution -- bars the SEC from, as a preliminary matter, asserting that the defendants’ crypto-assets are “investment contracts” that are subject to federal
securities laws.

&emsp; *C&period;&emsp; The SEC has, through its factual allegations, asserted a plausible claim that the defendants’ crypto-assets qualify as securities.*

[.text-justify]
Putting aside the SEC’s general authority to regulate certain crypto-assets as investment contracts, the Court must still resolve whether the defendants’ particular crypto-assets can fairly be given this label at this stage. For the reasons below, the Court concludes that the SEC has alleged facts sufficient to claim that the defendants’ crypto assets are securities. More specifically, the SEC has adequately pled that each of the defendants’ products are either themselves “investment contracts” or confer a right to “subscribe or purchase” another such security. See 15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(1).

&emsp; 1&period; [underline]#The Howey Test and its Scope#

[.text-justify]
Before proceeding, a few words on SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946) (“Howey”), in which the Supreme Court set forth the standard for determining whether a particular economic arrangement can be classified as an “investment contract.” The Howey case centered on a transaction between an “orange-grove” cultivator and investors, in which the cultivator sold investors various parcels of land along with a promise to share with them any profits that were generated from his cultivation of the parcels. Id. at 295-96, 299. In the Supreme Court’s view, the transaction – comprised of not just the sale of the underlying property but also the promise of any profits that attached to that property – amounted to a “investment contract” that the SEC could legally regulate. Put another way, it was the cultivator’s promise to share in the profits generated by his cultivation of the parcels that transformed the transaction from a mere sale of property into a contract that promised a future return based on an initial investment – that is, an investment contract.

[.text-justify]
Out of these facts emerged the Howey standard for determining the existence of an “investment contract.” Following Howey, an “investment contract” under federal securities law is any “contract, transaction, or scheme whereby a person [(1)] invests his money [(2)] in a common enterprise and [(3)] is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promotor or a third party.” Id. at 288-99. The question in the instant case, then, is whether each of the defendants’ crypto-assets -- and the means by which they were offered and sold -- amounted to a transaction or scheme that exhibited these three qualities.

[.text-justify]
Two preliminary notes are necessary before applying the Howey standard to the defendants’ crypto-assets. To begin with, there need not be -- contrary to defendants’ assertions -- a formal common-law contract between transacting parties for an “investment contract” to exist. Basic principles of interpretation compel this conclusion. By stating that “transaction[s]” and “scheme[s]” -- and not just “contract[s]” -- qualify as investment contracts, the Supreme Court made clear in Howey that Congress did not intend the term to apply only where transacting parties had drawn up a technically valid written or oral contract under state law. See id. Instead, Congress intended the phrase to apply in much broader circumstances: wherever the “contracting” parties agree -- that is, “scheme” -- that the contractee will make an investment of money in the contractor’s profit-seeking endeavor. So, the supposed absence of an enforceable written contract between the defendants and many of the defendants’ customers in this case does not, as an initial matter, preclude the SEC from asserting that defendants’ crypto-assets are nevertheless investment contracts.  Nor must the Court restrict its Howey analysis to whether the tokens themselves -- apart from any of the related various investment “protocols” -- constitute investment contracts. As the Supreme Court has long made clear, courts deciding whether a given transaction or scheme amounts to a “investment contract” under Howey must analyze the “substance” -- and not merely the “form” -- of the parties’ economic arrangement and decide if, under the “totality of the circumstances,” that transaction or scheme meets the three requirements of Howey. Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967); Glen-Arden Commodities, Inc. v. Constantino, 493 F.2d 1027, 1034 (2d Cir. 1974).

[.text-justify]
As reiterated by the Supreme Court in Maine Bank v. Weaver, to determine the applicability of the securities laws, a given transaction needs to be “evaluated on the basis of the content of the instruments in question, the purposes intended to be served, and the factual setting as a whole.” 445 U.S. 551, 560 n.11 (1982). The fact that, for example, the Anchor Protocol did not exist at the time UST and LUNA were first launched is therefore immaterial. A product that at one time is not a security may, as circumstances change, become an investment contract that is subject to SEC regulation. See Edwards, 540 U.S. at 390.  

[.text-justify]
To that end, the Court declines to erect an artificial barrier between the tokens and the investment protocols with which they are closely related for the purposes of its analysis. Instead, it will evaluate -- as the Supreme Court did in Howey -- whether the crypto-assets and the “full set of contracts, expectations, and understandings centered on the sales and distribution of [these tokens]” amounted to an “investment contract” under federal securities laws. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. Telegram Grp. Inc., 448 F. Supp. 3d 352, 379 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (setting forth that the putative subject of an investment contract must be considered alongside the full set of “contracts, expectations, and understandings” that attach to the subject); Howey, 328 U.S. at 297–98 (declining to “treat[] the contracts and deeds as separate transactions”).

[.text-justify]
To be sure, the original UST and LUNA coins, as originally created and when considered in isolation, might not then have been, by themselves, investment contracts. Much as the orange groves in Howey would not be considered securities if they were sold apart from the cultivator’s promise to share any profits derived by their cultivation, the term “security” also cannot be used to describe any crypto-assets that were not somehow intermingled with one of the investment “protocols,” did not confer a “right to ... purchase” another security, or were otherwise not tied to the growth of the Terraform blockchain ecosystem. See Telegram, 448 F. Supp. 3d at 379 (describing a crypto-asset as “little more than alphanumeric cryptographic sequence”); 15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(1) (including in the definition of security any instrument that confers a “right to subscribe to or purchase another security”). And where a stablecoin is designed exclusively to maintain a oneto-one peg with another asset, there is no reasonable basis for expecting that the tokens -- if used as stable stores of value or mirrored shares traded on public stock exchanges -- would generate profits through a common enterprise. So, in theory, the tokens, if taken by themselves, might not qualify as investment contracts.

[.text-justify]
But this conclusion is only marginally of interest, because, to begin with the coins were never, according to the amended complaint, standalone tokens. Rather, they conferred a “right to 
... purchase” another security, the LUNA tokens. 15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(1); Amended Complaint ¶ 84. Furthermore, the Amended Complaint alleges that the vast majority -- nearly 75 percent -- of the defendants’ UST tokens were deposited in the Anchor Protocol.

[.text-justify]
As to the first point, the SEC alleges that the LUNA coins were, from the outset, pitched to investors, not as stablecoins, but primarily as yield-bearing investments whose value would grow in line with the Terraform blockchain ecosystem. See, e.g., Amended Complaint ¶¶ 34-35, 46-47, 74-83. On these allegations, then, the Amended Complaint asserts that purchasers of LUNA coins reasonably expected their tokens to generate profits. And because the fees generated from the Mirror Protocol were allegedly distributed among holders of the MIR tokens, the Amended Complaint plausibly asserts that its purchasers viewed these tokens as profitable investments. It follows, moreover, that the UST coins, because they could be converted to LUNA coins, were also investment contracts.

[.text-justify]
As to the second point, the fact that most of the UST coins were deposited in the Anchor Protocol independently rendered these tokens investment contracts, indeed investments that were touted as being capable of being able to generate future profits of as much as 20%.

&emsp; 2&period; [underline]#Howey Applied to the SEC’s Claims#

[.text-justify]
Against the background of these general observations, the Court turns to whether the SEC has adequately pled that each of the defendants’ inter-related crypto-assets -- the UST coin, the 
LUNA coin, the wLUNA tokens, the MIR tokens, and the mAssets tokens -- qualify as “investment contracts” under the three-pronged Howey test.

[.text-justify]
Because the defendants do not dispute that each purchaser of the defendants’ crypto-assets made an “investment of money” in exchange for these crypto-assets, the Court’s analysis focuses exclusively on the two remaining Howey prongs. 

&emsp; &emsp; _a)&emsp; Common Enterprise_

[.text-justify]
First, the Amended Complaint states a plausible claim that purchasers of the defendants’ crypto-assets were investing in a common enterprise. Howey, 328 U.S. at 288-99. A common enterprise exists wherever there is “horizontal commonality” between purchasers and a given defendant. Such commonality, moreover, is established if each investor’s fortunes are “ti[ed] ... to the fortunes of the other investors by the pooling of assets,” and there is a “pro-rata distribution of profits” earned from these combined assets. Revak v. SEC Realty Corp., 18 F.3d 81, 87 (2d Cir. 1994).

[.text-justify]
Here, the defendants marketed the UST coins as an asset that, when deposited into the Anchor Protocol, could generate returns of up to 20%. See Amended Complaint ¶¶ 74-83. In essence, the UST tokens were allegedly “pooled” together in the Anchor Protocol and, through the managerial efforts of the defendants, were expected to generate profits that would then be re-distributed to all those who deposited their coins into the Anchor Protocol -- in other words, on a pro-rata basis. Id. ¶ 76. If the SEC’s allegations are credited -- which, at this stage, they must be -- there was thus plainly horizontal commonality between the defendants and at least those large majority of UST investors who deposited their coins in the Anchor Protocol.^*(xref:terraform_opinion_order_fn_6[6])*^

[.text-justify]
To be sure, not all UST token-holders deposited their tokens into the Anchor Protocol. Moreover, neither the LUNA tokens nor the MIR tokens could be deposited into the Anchor Protocol. The SEC’s theory for horizontal commonality as to these other coins, however, rests on a different but equally plausible theory. As to the LUNA tokens, for instance, the SEC has demonstrated horizontal commonality by alleging that the defendants’ used proceeds from LUNA coin sales to develop the Terraform blockchain and represented that these improvements would increase the value of the LUNA tokens themselves. See Amended Complaint ¶¶ 46-47, 49-51. In other words, by alleging that the defendants “pooled” the proceeds of LUNA purchases together and promised that further investment through these purchases would benefit all LUNA holders, the SEC has adequately pled that the defendants and the investors were joined in a common, profit-seeking enterprise. See, e.g., Balestra v. AtbCoin LLC, 380 F. Supp. 3d 340, 353 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (finding horizontal commonality where assets “were pooled together to facilitate the launch of the [blockchain], the success of which, in turn, would increase the value” of purchasers’ coins); SEC v. Kik Interactive, Inc., 492 F. Supp. 3d 169, 178 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (finding horizontal commonality where the issuer of the cryptoassets pooled funds and used the funds to construct and develop its digital ecosystem). And the wLUNA investors were just a variation on this theme since wLUNA tokens could be exchanged for LUNA tokens.

[.text-justify]
The SEC asserts an equally plausible claim that a similar scheme established horizontal commonality between MIR token investors and the defendants. According to the SEC, the proceeds from sales of the MIR tokens were “pooled together” to improve the Mirror Protocol. See Amended Complaint ¶ 87. Profits derived from the use of the Mirror Protocol, moreover, were fed back to investors based on the size of their investment. Here, too, the defendants tied their fortunes with those of the crypto-asset purchasers and distributed any profits generated by their investments on a pro-rata basis. See Revak, 18 F.3d at 87. 
Finally, the mAssets on their face were intended to reflect the fortunes of the existing securities they mirrored. (See also, further discussion of mAssets below).

&emsp;&emsp; _b)&emsp; Reasonable Expectation of Profits_

[.text-justify]
Under Howey, the SEC must adequately also plead that the investors not only invested in a common enterprise providing the possibility of future profits, but also that they were led to believe that it was the efforts of the defendants or other third parties that could earn them a return on their investment. Howey, 328 U.S. at 288-99 (defining an investment contract as one in which an investor is “led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promotor or a third party.”). The qualification that the investors’ expectations be reasonable is an important one. The SEC need not prove that each and every investor was personally led to think that profits would follow from their investment in the defendants’ products. If an objective investor would have perceived the defendants’ statements and actions as promising the possibility of such returns, the SEC has satisfied Howey’s requirement.

[.text-justify]
Through the facts alleged in its Amended Complaint, the Court concludes that the SEC meets this requirement. Beginning with investors in UST coins, the complaint adequately alleges that the defendants -- through social media posts, at investor conferences, in monthly investor reports, and at one-on-one meetings with investors -- repeatedly touted the profitability of the Anchor Protocol and encouraged UST coin purchasers to unload their tokens into that investment vehicle. See Amended Complaint ¶¶ 74-83. Those profits, the defendants allegedly stated, would come about through the defendants’ unique combination of investing and engineering experience. See id. ¶¶ 40, 57, 76.

[.text-justify]
Similarly, as to LUNA coin investors, the defendants allegedly coaxed investors to continue purchasing LUNA coins (and indirectly wLUNA coins) by pointing out the possibility of future investment returns. In particular, they said that profits from the continued sale of LUNA coins would be fed back into further development of the Terraform ecosystem, which would, in turn, increase the value of the LUNA coins. See id. ¶¶ 3, 31-33, 42, 4957 (alleging Kwon stated that “[i]n the long run, Luna[‘s] value is actionable -- it grows as the ecosystem grows”). And, as with the UST coins, the defendants premised their case for LUNA’s profitability on the defendants’ particular investment and technical acumen. See id. ¶¶ 31, 47, 57-58.  
The scheme surrounding the MIR tokens was, according to the Amended Complaint, nearly identical to that involving LUNA, except that the defendants’ linked the MIR tokens’ worth to the growth and development of the Mirror Protocol, rather than to the Terraform blockchain network more generally. See id. ¶¶ 90-96. And much the same could be said of the mAssets (discussed further below).

[.text-justify]
In conclusion, the SEC’s claim that the defendants held out to the coins’ consumers the possibility of profiting from their purchases is supported by specific factual allegations in the Amended Complaint, including readouts of investor meetings, excerpts of investor materials, and screenshots of social media posts made by Mr. Kwon and other Terraform executives. Because these particularized allegations, if true, clearly “nudge the [SEC’s] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible,” the SEC’s assertion that the crypto-assets at issue here are securities under Howey survives the defendants’ motion to dismiss. See Friel v. Dapper Labs, Inc., 2023 WL 2162747, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 22, 2023).

[.text-justify]
It may also be mentioned that the Court declines to draw a distinction between these coins based on their manner of sale, such that coins sold directly to institutional investors are considered securities and those sold through secondary market transactions to retail investors are not. In doing so, the Court rejects the approach recently adopted by another judge of this 
District in a similar case, SEC v. Ripple Labs Inc., 2023 WL 4507900 (S.D.N.Y. July 13, 2023). There, that court found that, “[w]hereas ... [i]nstitutional [b]uyers reasonably expected that [the defendant crypto-asset company] would use the capital it received from its sales to improve the [crypto-asset] ecosystem and thereby increase the price of [the crypto-asset],” those who purchased their coins through secondary transactions had no reasonable basis to expect the same. Id. at *11-12. According to that court, this was because the re-sale purchasers could not have known if their payments went to the defendant, as opposed to the third-party entity who sold them the coin. Whatever expectation of profit they had could not, according to that court, be ascribed to defendants’ efforts.

[.text-justify]
But Howey makes no such distinction between purchasers. And it makes good sense that it did not. That a purchaser bought the coins directly from the defendants or, instead, in a secondary resale transaction has no impact on whether a reasonable individual would objectively view the defendants’ actions and statements as evincing a promise of profits based on their efforts. Indeed, if the Amended Complaint’s allegations are taken as true -- as, again, they must be at this stage -- the defendants’ embarked on a public campaign to encourage both retail and institutional investors to buy their crypto-assets by touting the profitability of the cryptoassets and the managerial and technical skills that would allow the defendants to maximize returns on the investors’ coins.

[.text-justify]
As part of this campaign, the defendants said that sales from purchases of all crypto-assets -- no matter where the coins were purchased -- would be fed back into the Terraform blockchain and would generate additional profits for all crypto-asset holders. These representations would presumably have reached individuals who purchased their crypto-assets on secondary markets –- and, indeed, motivated those purchases -- as much as it did institutional investors. Simply put, secondary-market purchasers had every bit as good a reason to believe that the defendants would take their capital contributions and use it to generate profits on their behalf.


&emsp; *D&period;&emsp; The Court declines to dismiss the counts in the SEC’s Amended Complaint that relate to securities registration requirements.*


&emsp; 1&period; [underline]#LUNA and MIR Counts (Counts Four and Five)#

[.text-justify]
Assuming the defendants’ crypto-assets are securities, the defendants nonetheless seek to dismiss the SEC’s first set of 
“registration counts” -- Counts Four and Five of the Amended Complaint -- as inadequately pled. In those counts, the SEC alleges that the defendants’ offer and sale of its LUNA and MIR tokens amounted to unlawful public distributions of unregistered securities.

[.text-justify]
The defendants allegedly sold LUNA coins to institutional investors without any restrictions on their re-sale and loaned other LUNA coins to a U.S. institutional investor with the explicit purpose of “improving liquidity” in light of the then “lackluster performance ... of the LUNA token.” Amended Complaint ¶ 108. Because these transactions were allegedly made with the expectation that the purchasers would re-sell the coins into public markets, the SEC claims that they “essentially” amounted to “largescale unregistered public distributions of LUNA” prohibited under Section 5 of the of the Securities Act. Defs.’ Br. at 21. 

[.text-justify]
Contrary to defendants’ arguments, the SEC has pled sufficient facts to support this theory of liability. “Liability for violations of Section 5 extends to those who have ‘engaged in steps necessary to the distribution of [unregistered] security issues.’” U.S Secs. & Exch. Comm. v. Universal Exp., Inc., 475 F. Supp. 2d 412, 422 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting SEC v. Chinese Consol. Benev. Ass'n, Inc., 120 F.2d 738, 741 (2d Cir. 1941)).

[.text-justify]
If the SEC’s allegations are credited, the defendants loaned LUNA tokens to a U.S. institutional investor to “improve liquidity,” a term that in this context could signify little else than the defendants’ desire that the institutional investor redistribute the coins on the secondary market. Indeed, the SEC also claims that the U.S. institutional investors actually sold the loaned LUNA tokens on a U.S. crypto-asset trading platform. See Amended Complaint ¶ 109. The agency, thus, has made a prima facie case that the defendants were necessary participants to unregistered public distributions of the securities, in that these transactions “would not have taken place ... but for the defendants[‘] participation.” Cf. id.; see also SEC v. Murphy, 626 F.2d 633, 650-51 (9th Cir. 1980). The scheme, as alleged, is the very disguised public distribution that Section 5 seeks to prohibit.

[.text-justify]
This conclusion, of course, does not end the matter. Once the plaintiff satisfies its prima facie burden under Section 5 of the Securities Act, the burden shifts to the defendants to affirmatively plead an entitlement to the exemption. See SEC v. Canavagh, 445 F.3d 105, 111 n.13 (2d Cir. 2006).

[.text-justify]
Defendants fail to make the necessary showing. Nor is an exemption clear from the face of the complaint. SEC v. Sason, 433 F. Supp. 3d 496, 514 (S.D.N.Y. 2020).

[.text-justify]
For one, their insistence that the loan was intended to “improve liquidity” by “provid[ing] market participants on nonU.S. markets who were already intent on buying and selling LUNA a ready counterparty to trade against and thereby reduce their cost to trade” is, at this stage, completely unsupported by factual allegations. Defs.’ Br. at 22. Equally unpersuasive is their argument that they did not violate Section 5 because they “did not direct the firm to resell into the U.S. market.” Id. Proof of scienter, it is well-established, is not needed to show Section 5 liability. Cavanagh, 445 F.3d at 11 n.13.

[.text-justify]
The defendants’ argument as to its sale of the MIR tokens is even less availing. For one, the SEC alleges that the defendants sold 37 million MIR tokens to at least six U.S. purchasers. See Amended Complaint at § 112. Though the defendants point out that these sales were made through a subsidiary, this Court, as noted above, considers the parent Terraform Labs and its wholly owned subsidiaries to be one and the same for purposes of this motion.

[.text-justify]
The defendants, moreover, engaged in a “listing agreement with a U.S. crypto-asset trading platform for the listing of MIR tokens on the platform.” Amended Complaint ¶ 114. Here, they cannot evade the securities laws’ registration requirements through technological subterfuge. Even if, as the defendants say, the U.S. trading platform automatically generated the MIR tokens that were then sold, the defendants would still be required to register any distributions stemming from this platform because they allegedly pocketed the fees generated by the MIR token sales.

&emsp; 2&period; [underline]#mAssets Counts (Counts Five and Six)#

[.text-justify]
In its second set of “registration counts,” the SEC claims that the defendants offered, sold, and effected security-based swaps -- that is, its mAssets -- to non-eligible participants, in violation of Sections 5(e) and 5(l) of the Security Act. Most fundamentally, the defendants argue that the mAssets are not security-based swaps. This is because, according to the defendants, the mAssets do not involve a payment from one party to their counterparty based on a change of value in an underlying security. CFTC v. Wilson, 2018 WL 6322024, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 30, 2018) (defining a swap as a “contract in which two parties agree to exchange cash payments at predetermined dates in the future”).

[.text-justify]
The defendants, however, misunderstand the SEC’s allegations. Though the underlying mAsset does not involve a “swap,” offers and sales of such mAssets do, if the Amended Complaint’s allegations are to be believed. When an individual purchases an mAsset, they receive, in return for 150% of the traditional stock or security’s value, a token whose value rises and falls based on the value of that underlying stock or security. Thus, though the mAsset, after being purchased, thereafter involves no counterparty with which to “swap” and can be sold or “burned” at will, the original purchase does indeed involve a counterparty -- the defendants -- and a transfer of financial risk based on a stock or security’s future value. 7 U.S.C. § 1a(47) (defining a security-based swap as an agreement to transfer “the financial risk associated with a future change” in a security’s value “without also conveying a current or future direct or indirect ownership interest in [the] asset”).

[.text-justify]
And though, again, the defendants did not technically sell the mAssets through the Mirror Protocol, which programmatically generated the tokens, the defendants were allegedly responsible for the Protocol’s creation, upkeep, and promotion to the general public, including institutional and retail investors alike. Thus, though not the final step in the mAssets distribution cycle, they were “necessary participants” in it and, for their efforts, allegedly pocketed the fees generated by the Mirror Protocol.  

&emsp; *E&period;&emsp; The fraud counts in the SEC’s Amended Complaint also survive the defendants’ motion to dismiss.*

[.text-justify]
Finally, the defendants seek to dismiss Counts One and Two of the Amended Complaint -- otherwise known as the “fraud” counts – because, in their view, the SEC failed to satisfy any of the pleading requirements on those counts in two respects. First, the defendants contend, the SEC allegedly failed to demonstrate that the defendants’ statements regarding the crypto-assets’ utility on the “Chai” platform were false. Second, and relatedly, the defendants argue that the SEC did not assert particularized allegations of fraud in its Amended Complaint as to the May 2021 alleged de-pegging incident.

[.text-justify]
Defendants appear to misunderstand what is required for a fraud claim to be dismissed at this stage. On a motion to dismiss, the SEC must plead factual allegations that, if taken as true, would state a plausible claim for relief. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). Under Rule 9(b)’s particularity requirement, moreover, the SEC must also allege “precisely what material misstatements were made, the time and place of each misstatement, the speaker, the content, the [way] the statement was misleading, and what the defendants obtained as a result of the fraud.” Joseph Victori Wines Inc. v. Vina Santana Carolina, S.A., 933 F. Supp. 347, 356 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).

[.text-justify]
The SEC has met this burden: first, by asserting that the “Chai transactions” were processed in Korean Won and not on the Terraform blockchain, as the defendants claimed they were, see Amended Complaint ¶¶ 121, 134; and also second, by alleging that the defendants benefited from this allegedly false or misleading statement in the form of a $57 million investment in their company. Id. at ¶ 150. The pleading requirements do not require that the SEC affirmatively prove its allegations at this stage. The defendants’ contrary factual allegations about the relationship between Chai and the defendants’ crypto-assets -- aimed at showing that their statements about the crypto-assets’ utility on Chai were accurate -- are therefore unavailing for purposes of this motion.

[.text-justify]
Next, the defendants allege that the SEC did not plead a “misstatement or omission” with respect to the May 2021 de-pegging incident. This is because, in defendants’ view, Kwon was under no duty to disclose to investors that a third-party was responsible for restoring the token’s peg. However, on the Amended Complaint’s allegations, such a “duty to disclose” does apply, because it “arises whenever secret information renders prior public statements materially misleading.” In re Time Warner Inc. Sec. Litig., 9 F.3d 259, 268 (2d Cir. 1993). Here, the SEC has plausibly alleged both that the defendants ascribed the “re-peg” to the “self-healing” effects of the UST/LUNA algorithm and that the defendants knew that it was, in reality, a third-party investor that had stabilized the UST tokens value. That is enough under Second Circuit law to give rise to a duty to disclose that, on the SEC’s allegation, the defendants did not fulfill. See id at 268-69.

[.text-justify]
Finally, as to the defendants’ arguments that the count should be dismissed for lack of a proof of scienter, the SEC has, again, met its burden. Under Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Securities Act Section 17(a)(1), scienter can be pled either by “alleg[ing] facts establishing a motive to commit fraud and an opportunity to do so” or by “alleg[ing] facts constituting circumstantial evidence of either reckless or conscious behavior.” In re Time Warner, 9 F. 3d at 269.

[.text-justify]
Here, the SEC alleges that the defendants had a motive to mislead investors about the utility of their crypto-assets on the 
Chai platform, as the truth would decrease the tokens’ value. See Amended Complaint ¶¶ 121-122, 132. What is more, the Amended Complaint’s factual allegations give rise to the reasonable inference that Kwon had direct access to the truth about Chai and the de-pegging incident. For one, Kwon was a founder and board member of Chai until at least May 2022. Id. i 127. ^*(xref:terraform_opinion_order_fn_7[7])*^7 According to the SEC, moreover, Kwon personally negotiated the arrangement with the U.S. Trading Firm to buy UST for the express purpose of
restoring the peg. See Amended Complaint ii 166-167; SEC v. Constantin, 939 F. Supp. 2d 288, 308 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).

[1] A blockchain is a digital public ledger on which transactions between parties -- most often involving the exchange of cryptocurrencies -- are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone. Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are both understood to be “decentralized,” in that no entity has power over who can view transactions on the blockchain and the cryptocurrencies themselves are not denominated or minted by any centralized entity, such as a reserve bank.

[[terraform_opinion_order_fn_3]]
[3] Specifically, because jurisdiction in this case is predicated on federal statutes, the relevant inquiry -- as both parties agree -- is whether the defendants had sufficient contacts with the United States generally to give rise to personal jurisdiction. Thus, the SEC need not demonstrate that the defendants had purposefully directed their activities at any particular U.S. state to establish that the Court possesses personal jurisdiction.

[[terraform_opinion_order_fn_4]]
[4] In the defendants’ view, even these actions would not be enough to satisfy the SEC’s obligations under the Due Process Clause with respect to its allegations regarding UST. The agency, they press, needed to have “previously asserted that something is a security merely because it can be used to buy something else the SEC calls a security.” This, however, misstates the SEC’s position. While the SEC did claim that the UST tokens were securities because they could be exchanged for LUNA, it also alleged with respect to each of the defendants’ crypto-assets in its Amended Complaint that the defendants’ UST tokens qualify as securities not simply because they were used to buy LUNA, but because they satisfy Howey’s three-part test (see below) for identifying “investment contracts.” See Amended Complaint ¶¶ 74-83. It cannot be that the Due Process Clause requires an agency to detail in advance, in the name of “fair notice,” each and every argument it intends to make in an adjudication proceeding. That the SEC previously expressed its views that crypto-assets could be considered “investment contracts” under Howey suffices. 

[[terraform_opinion_order_fn_5]]
[5] Here, the Court makes explicit what has long been implied in the “fair notice” inquiry, at least as applied to agencies like the SEC that are charged with regulating highly technical entities. The question whether “fair notice” has been provided should be assessed from the perspective of a reasonable person in the defendant’s industry rather than from that of a member of the general public. It would make little sense to construe the Due Process Clause to require that agencies like the SEC provide “fair notice” to everyday citizens, most of whom have no interaction with the industries that the SEC is tasked with regulating. assets are “investment contracts” that are subject to federal securities laws.  

[[terraform_opinion_order_fn_6]]
[6] Considering the Court’s determination that the SEC has adequately pled the existence of “horizontal” commonality between such investors and the SEC, it sees no need to decide whether the SEC also established that there was vertical commonality between such investors and the defendants.

[[terraform_opinion_order_fn_7]]
[7] At this stage, violations of the securities laws by Terraform Labs can be imputed to its founder, CEO, and co-defendant, Do Hyeong Kwon. As the alleged CEO, founder, and majority shareholder of Terraform Labs, Kwon retained "control" over the company. See Amended Complaint ii 128-129. Kwon was also, according to the Amended Complaint, intimately involved in the central events of this litigation -- including communications with investors over the use of the defendants' crypto-assets on Chai and the May 2021 de-pegging incident. Id. ~i 134-142, 157-159. As such, violations of securities laws by Terraform Labs may be imputed to Mr. Kwon under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.
